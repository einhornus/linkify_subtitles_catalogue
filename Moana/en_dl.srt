1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,956
Again I hear that whisper of the surf. Who am I?

2
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:16,370
Where my heart is, only water knows!

3
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:21,213
A hundred times I promised them not to argue, but

4
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:27,650
The sea draws me back as if I were its wave.

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,056
Every new step, every turn.

6
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:33,753
Every trace and every sign leads me again.

7
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:36,780
Into a world of great winds and bottomless waters.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,599
I want to sail away...

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,843
And in my eyes every day an ocean boundless

10
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:51,028
Calls me over the horizon!

11
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:55,887
I wish I could set sail for the long haul.

12
00:00:55,887 --> 00:01:03,640
He will show all that has been waiting for me there for so long.

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,790
Life on the island goes on and on forever.

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:14,314
And people have joy day in and day out.

15
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:21,290
Everyone knows what their part is, Everyone plays their part.

16
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,430
And maybe I'll have mine.

17
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,189
I will be a chief, I will lead the people!

18
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:31,246
We shall prosper from year to year.

19
00:01:31,246 --> 00:01:34,329
But that's not what my heart sings about.

20
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,585
What's wrong with me?

21
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:44,758
I see the sun's way on crystal waves.

22
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,357
It's leading me.

23
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:56,143
And I know it wants to tell me his secrets.

24
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:59,342
So go ahead!

25
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:02,843
Take the first step, conquer your fear!

26
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:07,785
And in the eyes every day an ocean boundless.

27
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:14,014
I'm calling out over the horizon

28
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:19,386
I wish I could set sail and go far away

29
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:28,743
It will show all that has been waiting for me
