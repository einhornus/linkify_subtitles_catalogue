1
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:05,769
About two thousand years ago,

2
00:00:06,0006 --> 00:00:08,978
during the reign of Cleopatra, the Queen of Queens,

3
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:11,810
the Egyptians spoke like this...

4
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:52,658
This language is certainly not easy to understand.

5
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:57,663
The film you are about to see will therefore be dubbed in French.

6
00:00:57,923 --> 00:00:59,963
But the techniques of the time

7
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:02,709
being less perfect than those of today,

8
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:05,130
you will notice that, sometimes,

9
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:08,227
the lip movements are slightly out of sync

10
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,010
with the spoken words.

11
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:15,902
After this prologue, as interesting as instructive...

12
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:21,238
we have the honor and the advantage...

13
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:29,029
to present you a great historical fresco.

14
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:23,838
I, Cleopatra, cannot accept your contempt, oh Caesar!

15
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:29,430
I will not tolerate the insulting words of the chief of barbarians

16
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:34,034
who occupy my country only because I want them to!

17
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:39,189
The Romans are incapable of building solid monuments.

18
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:40,860
While our monuments

19
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:46,321
will accumulate millennia without suffering in the least.

20
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,668
And you dare to tell me that we are not

21
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:53,053
able to build properly anymore!

22
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,547
Any other than you would have already

23
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:58,377
met my sacred crocodiles.

24
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,883
You can't insult me with impunity!

25
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:04,513
If only you had the courtesy to listen to me,

26
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:08,107
but the Romans don't know the meaning of the word courtesy.

27
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,733
To say that we, the descendants of the pharaohs,

28
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:13,397
are unable to build,

29
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:17,195
it's ignoble, filthy, ridiculous, grotesque, unseemly!

30
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:21,205
To finish, what you say here is infamous, Caesar.

31
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:24,024
Face the facts.

32
00:06:24,423 --> 00:06:27,259
- Your people are decadent. - They built the pyramids.

33
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:29,884
The tower of Pharos, the temples, the obelisks!

34
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:31,634
It's all old.

35
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:33,303
Enough of this!

36
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,851
I will prove to you that my people are not decadent.

37
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:41,559
In 3 months, I will have built you a sumptuous palace

38
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:44,739
here, in Alexandria.

39
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,783
Well, it's understood.

40
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:49,819
If you win your bet, I will recognize that your people

41
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:52,288
is still a great people.

42
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,209
She is cute, but the spices go up her nose...

43
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,508
which she has pretty, by the way.

44
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:10,595
Edifis,

45
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:15,734
you're the best architect in Alexandria, and that's not much.

46
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:19,484
Your houses are the laughing stock of those who don't live there.

47
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:25,115
My specialty is pyramids.

48
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:29,244
You have three months to redeem yourself by building a palace.

49
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,998
Here, in Alexandria, for Julius Caesar.

50
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,255
3 months?

51
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:36,763
If you succeed, I'll cover you with gold, if not,

52
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,475
I'll throw you to the crocodiles. Go!

53
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:46,271
Three months! To succeed, I would need the help of a mage.

54
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:49,739
A mage ?

55
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,865
I am saved!

56
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:55,239
I know just the man.

57
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:27,493
I will train him to carry menhirs.

58
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,241
Meanwhile, set the table.

59
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:55,444
The druid Getafix, please.

60
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:58,702
On the tree, picking mistletoe.

61
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:02,0002
Getafix!

62
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,454
Ouch!

63
00:09:04,0004 --> 00:09:06,961
Oh, what a nice surprise!

64
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:11,130
I'm, my dear friend, very happy to see you.

65
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:12,584
It's an alexandrine.

66
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:22,932
Let me introduce you to my friend Edifis,

67
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:26,026
an architect from Alexandria.

68
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:31,319
I have to build a palace for Caesar

69
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,033
within 3 months.

70
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:34,618
If I don't..,

71
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,919
Cleopatra will feed me to the crocodiles.

72
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,256
- Do you eat crocodiles? - Hush, Obelix.

73
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:45,258
If you don't help me I won't succeed.

74
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,513
Calm down, Edifis.

75
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,142
I'll go to Egypt with you.

76
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:55,145
Us too, by Toutatis. Us too, by Toutatis.

77
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:58,233
By Osiris. Is that right?

78
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:00,694
We're going to have a nice trip, ldefix.

79
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:01,565
Are you taking him with you?

80
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:03,535
And why not, mister Asterix?

81
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:06,871
He's too small for such a big trip.

82
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,328
Go pack your bags.

83
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:11,788
I'm the stooge, the sidekick.

84
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,014
I have no say in the matter.

85
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:18,555
My friends, be worthy of us,

86
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:22,222
and may the sky not fall on your heads.

87
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,440
I have prepared a little departure song.

88
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:27,438
Oh no!

89
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:38,038
Ignorant!

90
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:50,464
Whoa, whoa!

91
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,508
It was me who went wow.

92
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,184
- Am I not allowed to do that anymore? - Come on, stubborn.

93
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,681
Let it out of the bag, your ldéfix.

94
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,831
We can set sail, Tumeheris.

95
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,212
Set sail!

96
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:33,811
In Egypt, we will have to fight against many

97
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,311
difficulties. And during the trip,

98
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,408
we may encounter pirates.

99
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,865
We'll take care of that. Right, Obelix?

100
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,043
Oh yes, we will.

101
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,413
Ship to starboard!

102
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,056
Pirates? The pirates!

103
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:16,286
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

104
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:20,164
Wait for us, we're coming. Yoo-hoo!

105
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:31,254
So, children, we don't get upset.

106
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:33,261
We board them, we slit their throats,

107
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,560
we gut them, we slaughter them

108
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,261
and we sink them.

109
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:42,860
The usual routine.

110
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:45,154
When I yell boarding!

111
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:46,406
Boarding!

112
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:47,781
What do you mean, boarding?

113
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,020
I'll be right with you.

114
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,030
Didn't I keep you waiting?

115
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:33,758
Cheaters !

116
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:35,919
How, to the boarding ?

117
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,039
A'i'e !

118
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:40,599
Ouch !

119
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,042
Hou là !

120
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:51,613
What do you mean, boarding?

121
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:55,781
Ouch!

122
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,0008
Come on, Obelix.

123
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:15,810
Let's go.

124
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,309
Yes, Asterix,

125
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:21,228
but there's still one upstairs.

126
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:23,568
No, no!

127
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:34,125
What do you mean, boarding?

128
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:38,134
The usual routine.

129
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:46,046
After a long and calm trip without any notable incident,

130
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:48,105
on a peaceful night,

131
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:52,226
the ship is nearing the end of its quiet journey.

132
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,232
That glow on the horizon?

133
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:58,905
It is the tower of the island of Pharos, whose fire guides the ships.

134
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,0001
We will be in Alexandria tomorrow.

135
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,575
A tower to guide the ships?

136
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,457
These Egyptians are crazy!

137
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,036
The bath of Cleopatra!

138
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,456
The bath of Cleopatra!

139
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,044
The bath of Cleopatra!

140
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:47,430
It is the bath of Cleopatra

141
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:50,174
Limpid and perfumed bath

142
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:53,516
To bathe her body of alabaster

143
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:56,182
Let us pour the amphorae of milk

144
00:16:03,0003 --> 00:16:05,243
Cleopatra's soap !

145
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:08,411
Cleopatra's soap!

146
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,625
The soap of Cleopatra!

147
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:16,165
Cleopatra sovereign

148
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:19,472
You are beautiful, we know it

149
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:22,132
It is for you, Queen of Queens,

150
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,975
Let's bring the soap

151
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:37,160
Lalalalala lalala lala !

152
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,621
The lion of Cleopatra !

153
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,246
The lion of Cleopatra !

154
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,462
The lion of Cleopatra!

155
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:50,050
It is the lion of Cleopatra

156
00:16:50,263 --> 00:16:52,671
It is the king of the animals

157
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:55,681
Courage like four

158
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,981
And spirit... So that, zero, eh!

159
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,984
La lalalalala lalala !

160
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,367
Badabadabada badabada!

161
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,449
Li lilililili lilili!

162
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:14,014
Badabadaba bada badabada!

163
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:36,036
Edifis asks for an audience.

164
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:37,684
Let him enter.

165
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,938
O my Queen, here are the Gallic friends:

166
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:45,614
A powerful magician and the brave warriors

167
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:48,194
who'll help me in my enterprise.

168
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:50,911
Fine, but hurry. Time is short.

169
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:55,787
If you succeed, gold for everyone.

170
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:59,170
If not, everyone for the crocodiles.

171
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:03,260
By the way, I'm warning you that Amonbofis, your rival,

172
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:05,889
is angry at you for having been chosen in his place.

173
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,606
I think he would be happy to see your career end in a...

174
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:13,013
- Crocodile? - That's right.

175
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,154
Now, come on!

176
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:17,862
Bad temper, but nice nose.

177
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:19,612
Very nice nose.

178
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,022
I'll take you home with me.

179
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:27,210
That's from me.

180
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,209
That's mine too.

181
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:33,797
That's still mine.

182
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:44,978
This was from me.

183
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:49,777
This is my home.

184
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,899
I would have guessed it.

185
00:20:00,0000 --> 00:20:02,165
The door is still stuck.

186
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:03,420
The humidity...

187
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:05,752
I'll give you a hand.

188
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:07,802
No, Obelix!

189
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:14,311
Don't scold him, the wood is too dry.

190
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,692
This is your home.

191
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,499
Please follow me.

192
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:38,261
Are you coming, Obelix?

193
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,590
This is where I work.

194
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:15,639
Master, the architect Amonbofis asks to see you.

195
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:17,893
My rival? Let him come in.

196
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:19,891
I'll get straight to the point.

197
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,557
Let's build Caesar's palace together.

198
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:26,735
If we succeed, we'll share the gold.

199
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:31,370
If not, you'll be eaten alone by crocodiles.

200
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:35,573
After all, where there's one to eat,

201
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,167
there's no need for two.

202
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,883
I refuse ! You are deceitful,

203
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,294
dishonest and unpleasant.

204
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,753
Get out of my house!

205
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:48,306
You will regret it.

206
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:52,975
You'll end up in a saurian, you scoundrel!

207
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:14,374
I'll take you to the construction site.

208
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:18,883
Yes, it will be interesting to see how you work.

209
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,596
Dogmatix!

210
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:05,823
Are they slaves?

211
00:23:06,0006 --> 00:23:08,531
No, they are free workers.

212
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,576
These Egyptians are crazy!

213
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,610
It's the lunch break. Come and see the plans of the palace.

214
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:41,865
What are they doing?

215
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,948
Overtime.

216
00:23:47,545 --> 00:23:51,051
Here is the plan, I drew it myself.

217
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:52,925
I recognize your hand.

218
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,011
My friends!

219
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:15,117
Don't let this lousy architect exploit you.

220
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,159
He beats you too much and doesn't pay you enough.

221
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:21,162
Stop the work!

222
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:23,995
React against those who make fun of you.

223
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:26,253
Abandon them!

224
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:28,028
Go on strike!

225
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:30,264
Go home!

226
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:59,963
Master, the workers refuse to return to work.

227
00:25:00,387 --> 00:25:02,464
Someone has turned them against me.

228
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:03,804
But who?

229
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:04,890
Who what?

230
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,387
Amonbofis, your rival, no doubt.

231
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:10,561
All these worries make me sick.

232
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:13,653
The sacred crocodiles will find me inedible.

233
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,646
Are you so keen on being a good meal?

234
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:19,994
They are sacred crocodiles, after all.

235
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,620
These architects are crazy!

236
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,827
Let's go and see what's going on.

237
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:31,335
We refuse to continue. The work is too hard.

238
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:33,383
Yeah!

239
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:37,256
They don't want to work anymore.

240
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:44,314
Oh, the work is too hard?

241
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:48,569
Asterix, light a nice fire under that pot.

242
00:25:59,129 --> 00:25:59,995
No.

243
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:05,461
Not you. You fell into it when you were little.

244
00:26:06,138 --> 00:26:09,424
Give them a little demonstration, Asterix.

245
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,391
It's a true prodigy.

246
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,269
But yes. Call your workers.

247
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:52,394
I'll give them a ration of my magic potion.

248
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:07,378
No !

249
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:17,599
No !

250
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:23,899
No !

251
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,117
No !

252
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,166
Can he recognize me?

253
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:54,890
And hop!

254
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:56,565
And hop!

255
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,704
I have to do something.

256
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:43,959
Screwdriver!

257
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:46,256
Yes, oh Amonbofis, my master?

258
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:48,883
Edifis is waiting for the stones

259
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:51,878
coming from the south by the Nile.

260
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:55,974
The stones must not arrive.

261
00:28:56,397 --> 00:29:00,146
Here's some gold to deal with this matter.

262
00:29:00,444 --> 00:29:04,573
You'll be obeyed, O Amonbofis, my master.

263
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,669
Amonbofis sends you this gold

264
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:21,425
so that the stones don't reach their destination.

265
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,339
D'ac, by Osiris!

266
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:25,343
Throw me those stones!

267
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,578
Hop, hop, hop !

268
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,630
Hop, hop, hop !

269
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:54,054
Hop, hop, hop !

270
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:56,131
Hop, hop, hop !

271
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:04,148
There are no more stones.

272
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:07,815
It's an Amonbofis trick.

273
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,565
Without stones, no palace.

274
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:13,531
Without palaces, crocodiles.

275
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:16,706
Calm down, we'll go get your stones.

276
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:20,020
We'll be back soon with the stones.

277
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:23,505
We have little time left to finish the palace.

278
00:30:24,384 --> 00:30:29,842
They must not return from this trip, Screwdriver.

279
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,556
They won't come back, master.

280
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:39,234
It's slow. It's too slow.

281
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,733
Let's connect the boats with ropes.

282
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:45,116
Finally, a little exercise!

283
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:59,059
By Toutatis, this boy will always amaze me.

284
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:20,907
There's a lack of boar and beer here.

285
00:31:21,165 --> 00:31:23,538
Well, the appetite comes with eating.

286
00:31:33,973 --> 00:31:37,037
Asterix's Cervoise!

287
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,043
When appetite goes, everything goes

288
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,045
When appetite goes, everything goes

289
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,112
Let's empty the barrels Let's have a feast

290
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,151
When the appetite goes, everything goes

291
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:53,111
When the appetite goes, everything goes When the appetite goes, everything goes

292
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:55,496
Long live the quenottes that crunch and nibble

293
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,459
When appetite goes, everything goes

294
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:02,341
Obelix's boars!

295
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:08,432
Listen to what follows

296
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:11,436
The old proverb is changed

297
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:14,393
You don't eat to live

298
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:17,397
You have to live to eat

299
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:21,320
When the appetite goes, everything goes For health there is only that

300
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:25,444
The worst emotion is to have your stomach in your heels

301
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:29,538
Little gourmets and fatties On an allegro rhythm

302
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,834
To eat and drink Make the jaws play

303
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:34,247
When the appetite goes, everything goes

304
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,793
The bones of ldefix!

305
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,784
Obelix, my dear love

306
00:33:01,0001 --> 00:33:03,664
I will always obey you

307
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:07,373
And the King of Kings from now on, it's you

308
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:11,011
When Obelix goes, everything goes

309
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:13,879
Cleo, I love your cute nose

310
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:16,468
I also like mushrooms

311
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:18,847
And then the sausages And the gingerbread

312
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:21,147
When appetite goes, everything goes

313
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:33,447
When appetite goes, everything goes

314
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,824
A good meal without cheese

315
00:34:05,0005 --> 00:34:07,953
It is a beast with only one eye

316
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,999
It's a bird without plumage

317
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,927
A forest without a squirrel

318
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,338
- When appetite goes... - Everything goes!

319
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,342
- When the appetite goes... - All is well!

320
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,510
- Come and pay tribute... - To the kings of cheese.

321
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,226
- When appetite goes... - Anything goes!

322
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:36,360
When the camel passes, alas When the camel passes, alas

323
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:38,580
We must praise its sobriety

324
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,743
When the camel passes, alas

325
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:44,337
But no, I have a hump,

326
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:47,925
I am a camel, not a camel.

327
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:50,131
Oh, it's annoying in the end.

328
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:55,266
When appetite goes, everything goes When appetite goes, everything goes

329
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:57,479
Long live the quenottes that crunch and nibble

330
00:34:57,732 --> 00:34:59,476
When the appetite goes, everything goes

331
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:03,354
Don't forget it, good people The appetite comes with eating

332
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:05,323
Let's empty the barrels Let's have a feast

333
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:10,010
When the appetite goes, everything goes !

334
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,259
Tomorrow we will visit the sphinx and the pyramids.

335
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:26,598
It's worth it.

336
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,031
What do you say?

337
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:37,355
Ldefix, here!

338
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:39,446
Here, ldefix!

339
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:41,537
ldefix, here!

340
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:45,752
Leave him alone, ldefix.

341
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,293
There must be a beautiful view from up there.

342
00:35:57,392 --> 00:35:59,350
Dogmatix, wait for me here.

343
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,942
Obelix!

344
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,996
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

345
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:24,333
Let's not linger here, come on!

346
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:57,593
From the top of these pyramids, twenty centuries contemplate you.

347
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:05,0005
There must be a beautiful view from up there.

348
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,310
Obelix, be quiet.

349
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:11,391
Well, it's not worth a nice menhir, those pyramids.

350
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,189
I wonder if we can visit.

351
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:17,189
But yes, but yes, but yes, but yes.

352
00:37:17,953 --> 00:37:21,999
I'm a guide and I can show the pyramids

353
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:25,210
to noble foreign tourists.

354
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:28,205
Well, we accept with pleasure.

355
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:33,504
Follow the guide!

356
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:37,215
In there, it's not for little dogs.

357
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:38,474
Wait for us here.

358
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:42,185
If you're good, you'll get a nice bone.

359
00:37:57,057 --> 00:38:00,123
Very interesting, these pyramids.

360
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:26,576
Do not lose sight of me, noble strangers.

361
00:38:27,027 --> 00:38:31,497
Without me, you wouldn't get out of this labyrinth alive.

362
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:36,921
Enter, enter...

363
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:42,139
The hieroglyphs that adorn this room are magnificent.

364
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:47,308
You will never get out of here,

365
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:50,985
strangers! This tomb will be your tomb.

366
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,708
Very interesting, these bas-reliefs.

367
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:02,957
In the meantime,

368
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:04,838
we have to get out of here.

369
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,630
It wouldn't have happened in a menhir.

370
00:39:08,0008 --> 00:39:11,504
Under the circumstances, Obelix..,

371
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,635
...for the first time..,

372
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:19,349
I'll give you a drink of the magic potion.

373
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:23,437
Really?

374
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,611
I'm going to have some magic potion!

375
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:29,739
I'll have some magic potion.

376
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:32,369
Galapagos, galapagos!

377
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:43,043
I'm glad I came to the pyramid.

378
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,596
Obelix, after you.

379
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,725
Can I have some more?

380
00:40:02,496 --> 00:40:04,121
So, are you coming?

381
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:15,502
Very interesting, these labyrinths.

382
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,636
Let's try this door.

383
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,601
Can I have some more?

384
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:22,265
No, Obelix!

385
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:24,729
Oh well, that's not fair, then.

386
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,152
I barely have time to taste it before he rations me.

387
00:40:28,404 --> 00:40:29,685
That's not fair.

388
00:40:39,752 --> 00:40:42,754
I'm afraid that guide was right.

389
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:46,425
We won't get out of here alive.

390
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:48,887
I feel sorry for Edifis.

391
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:51,298
Without us, he'll never make it.

392
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:55,552
I feel sorry for my poor little Dogmatix.

393
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:58,275
Dogmatix!

394
00:41:00,195 --> 00:41:02,104
He found us with his nose.

395
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:05,616
He can find his way back and get us out of here.

396
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:10,868
You will have two big bones.

397
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,137
You'll have a bunch of big bones.

398
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:33,610
It seems that he understands everything I say.

399
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:34,729
Let's follow the guide!

400
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:56,305
Magi... You are wise men.

401
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,528
Magi... They are magicians.

402
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,574
They came out of the pyramid.

403
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,660
These Gauls are prodigious.

404
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:22,215
But the Gauls haven't reached Alexandria yet.

405
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:24,294
They have to go up the Nile.

406
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,428
We must stop them.

407
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:29,428
I have the men you need, master:

408
00:42:29,684 --> 00:42:31,031
Some dreadful pirates

409
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:34,183
having lost their ship, it seems,

410
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:35,982
of a false maneuver.

411
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:38,038
Bring them to me.

412
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,147
Here they are, master.

413
00:42:43,118 --> 00:42:45,194
I offer you a boat.

414
00:42:45,454 --> 00:42:47,993
With it, you will go down the course of the Nile.

415
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:52,462
You will cross a caravan of ships carrying stones.

416
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:58,297
If these ships don't reach Alexandria, you'll have gold,

417
00:42:58,554 --> 00:42:59,633
a lot of gold.

418
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,767
Board them, slit their throats, gut them, slaughter them,

419
00:43:05,0005 --> 00:43:06,729
exterminate them

420
00:43:07,148 --> 00:43:08,940
and sink them!

421
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:11,565
The usual routine.

422
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:25,707
Cruises are monotonous.

423
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:28,634
I'm bored, Asterix.

424
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:34,431
I have the impression that we're going to have fun soon.

425
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:39,264
Caravan carrying stones, straight ahead!

426
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:42,858
Okay, kids, let's not get too excited...

427
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:48,105
It's full of Gauls in there!

428
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:51,242
Gauls? Full back!

429
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,537
Run for it! Turn around!

430
00:43:57,754 --> 00:44:01,587
You'll be able to distract yourself. Pirates, straight ahead!

431
00:44:02,636 --> 00:44:05,590
Pirates? Fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy!

432
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:14,357
Yoo-hoo! Youhou!

433
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,610
Wait for me, I'm coming!

434
00:44:17,017 --> 00:44:19,153
Faster, faster!

435
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,367
It's too late.

436
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:40,040
I think we can get back on track.

437
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:42,042
How about that? It bites.

438
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:45,045
Yuck, I don't eat that.

439
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:58,498
Well... uh... another false move.

440
00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:03,455
But they're starting to get on my nerves, those Gauls.

441
00:45:04,0004 --> 00:45:07,0007
Well, since it's like that,

442
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,511
I've got a terrible idea.

443
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:14,181
Is it a good idea, master?

444
00:45:14,436 --> 00:45:18,137
It's a piece of cake. Follow me!

445
00:45:27,452 --> 00:45:30,988
Poisoned pastry.

446
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:34,034
- The deadly doughnuts. - Yes.

447
00:45:34,503 --> 00:45:36,710
- Lightning macaroons. - Not bad.

448
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:39,456
- Viper venom pie. - Classic.

449
00:45:39,718 --> 00:45:42,554
- Clafoutis with curare. - Not so good!

450
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:45,808
Arsenic pudding.

451
00:45:46,101 --> 00:45:47,299
Oh yes!

452
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:52,771
In a big bowl of strychnine, dissolve morphine

453
00:45:53,193 --> 00:45:55,151
Warm it up in a saucepan

454
00:45:55,571 --> 00:45:58,058
A good glass of oil

455
00:45:58,325 --> 00:46:00,117
I'll put in two.

456
00:46:01,162 --> 00:46:05,243
A few drops of hemlock Some leech slime

457
00:46:05,751 --> 00:46:07,791
A scorpion cut very thin

458
00:46:08,0008 --> 00:46:10,502
And a little peppercorn

459
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:12,801
- No. - Ah.

460
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:19,468
Crumble your arsenic

461
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:21,721
In a glass of narcotic

462
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:26,395
Two spoonfuls of purgative that you boil on high

463
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:28,397
I'll put three.

464
00:46:28,947 --> 00:46:33,195
In a small separate dish Tiédir of the blood of lizard

465
00:46:33,453 --> 00:46:35,530
The value of a thimble

466
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:37,782
And a little powdered sugar

467
00:46:38,918 --> 00:46:39,665
No !

468
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,041
Oh well.

469
00:46:46,046 --> 00:46:50,306
You pour rat poison into cobra venom

470
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:55,186
To sweeten the mixture Squeeze three orange segments

471
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:56,851
I'll put in one.

472
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:01,606
Decorate with candied fruit Molded in verdigris

473
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:03,941
While your dough is soft

474
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,944
And a little vitriol

475
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:07,0007
No.

476
00:47:07,288 --> 00:47:08,0008
Yes !

477
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:10,455
I knew it would be good.

478
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:39,285
Arsenic pudding

479
00:47:39,704 --> 00:47:41,744
Allows us this prognosis

480
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:46,377
Tomorrow on the banks of the Nile What will the crocodiles eat?

481
00:47:47,673 --> 00:47:48,419
Some...

482
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:49,499
Gau...

483
00:47:49,925 --> 00:47:52,298
...laws !

484
00:47:58,854 --> 00:48:01,476
A gift for you, O my Queen.

485
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:02,728
Let him enter.

486
00:48:09,0009 --> 00:48:13,328
The three Gauls offer this cake to the Queen of Queens.

487
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:14,530
Very kind.

488
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:18,458
You will thank them on behalf of Cleopatra.

489
00:48:18,712 --> 00:48:21,548
My taster! Let them call my taster.

490
00:48:22,217 --> 00:48:24,459
Here, here, here.

491
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,429
Taste, taster.

492
00:48:26,722 --> 00:48:28,965
With joy, oh my Queen.

493
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:37,317
Hou là, hou là, hou là...

494
00:48:37,736 --> 00:48:41,272
Hou là, hou là, hou là...

495
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:44,537
Finally, my friends.

496
00:48:44,787 --> 00:48:46,412
You are back.

497
00:48:46,664 --> 00:48:50,663
We bring you enough stones to finish the construction.

498
00:48:51,546 --> 00:48:54,382
Gauls! In the name of the Queen, I arrest you.

499
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,508
Should we slap them?

500
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:58,920
No, Obelix, calm down.

501
00:48:59,222 --> 00:49:01,262
Let's go and see what's going on.

502
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:05,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

503
00:49:08,0008 --> 00:49:11,525
You tried to poison me with that cake.

504
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,776
What cake?

505
00:49:13,198 --> 00:49:17,017
Throw them in the dungeon while I decide their fate.

506
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,283
Not a moment to lose.

507
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,701
Let's drink this antidote and get out.

508
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:25,918
This potion

509
00:49:26,298 --> 00:49:28,837
will make us immune to the poison.

510
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,674
We're serving an appetizer to the sacred crocodiles.

511
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:37,037
Move aside, we're going out.

512
00:50:03,0003 --> 00:50:04,341
Can we go in?

513
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:07,463
Guards, seize these men!

514
00:50:09,979 --> 00:50:13,681
Gauls come from afar to overwhelm me with hatred,

515
00:50:13,942 --> 00:50:16,897
I will show you how a queen dies

516
00:50:17,155 --> 00:50:19,611
and what courage I have.

517
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:22,738
I'm ready, Osiris.

518
00:50:23,413 --> 00:50:25,025
How well she plays.

519
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:28,744
We just want to know what you blame us for.

520
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:31,293
What do I have against you? This.

521
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:33,507
But that cake looks very good.

522
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:36,927
Obelix, go get a pie server.

523
00:50:38,432 --> 00:50:39,428
May I?

524
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,342
Cut three slices of this cake.

525
00:50:50,865 --> 00:50:52,407
Three shares, I said.

526
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,778
Ah yes, three parts.

527
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,412
Greedy, you!

528
00:51:04,173 --> 00:51:07,175
Well, it's an excellent cake.

529
00:51:07,427 --> 00:51:09,0009
What's so special about it?

530
00:51:09,513 --> 00:51:11,174
Ask my taster.

531
00:51:11,683 --> 00:51:15,100
Hou là, hou là, hou là, hou là, hou là...

532
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:17,395
Hmm, let's see...

533
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:23,352
It's just a little indigestion.

534
00:51:23,656 --> 00:51:26,148
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow...

535
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:28,908
I'm fine.

536
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,031
I'm hungry.

537
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,623
I have been unfair to you, Gauls.

538
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:36,500
I give you back your freedom. Come on!

539
00:51:39,844 --> 00:51:41,718
Someone wanted to harm us.

540
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:43,680
- Yes, but who? - Amonbofis.

541
00:51:44,044 --> 00:51:46,638
- Edifis' rival? - I'm sure.

542
00:51:46,894 --> 00:51:50,181
- Shall we visit him? - I was going to suggest it.

543
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,443
Amonbofis, please.

544
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:54,774
This way.

545
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:58,863
Let's drink to victory, Screwdriver!

546
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:01,782
The time has come for us to toast.

547
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:08,113
We will give you the opportunity to work with Edifis.

548
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:21,021
The palace is going well, Edifis.

549
00:53:21,348 --> 00:53:23,258
You'll finish in time.

550
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,558
Cleopatra will be happy.

551
00:53:26,271 --> 00:53:29,392
Very happy. The palace is finished.

552
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:32,313
I'll win my bet.

553
00:53:32,571 --> 00:53:35,656
I'm delighted, my queen, absolutely delighted.

554
00:53:38,453 --> 00:53:41,206
I will lose face in front of Cleopatra.

555
00:53:41,582 --> 00:53:45,367
I had however been described her architect as an incompetent.

556
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:47,580
Things happen that I do not know.

557
00:53:48,048 --> 00:53:50,296
Let them call my spy!

558
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,388
Here I am, master, here I am.

559
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:55,506
Come here.

560
00:53:56,056 --> 00:53:59,393
Go see what's going on in Edifis.

561
00:53:59,647 --> 00:54:03,0003
I want to know why the work is going so well.

562
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:08,191
Let's do it.

563
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:11,395
Three Gauls?

564
00:55:12,114 --> 00:55:15,650
An old druid, a smart aleck and a fat fool?

565
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:19,864
Asterix, Obelix and Getafix!

566
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:23,370
These three are capable of all kinds of wonders.

567
00:55:23,629 --> 00:55:25,587
We must act.

568
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:30,503
Summon my Egyptian mercenaries.

569
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:35,803
Hail Caesar!

570
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:41,852
Those who will serve you for a small fee salute you.

571
00:55:42,403 --> 00:55:45,607
Enter Edifis' construction site

572
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:48,114
without being noticed.

573
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:51,454
Spill the pot of magic potion

574
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:54,123
and take the druid.

575
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:57,920
A bag of gold if you succeed.

576
00:55:58,256 --> 00:56:00,297
Execute, by Jupiter!

577
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:05,590
Let's go, o Caesar, by Osiris !

578
00:56:24,123 --> 00:56:26,246
I'll take care of the pot.

579
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:28,708
You two take care of the druid.

580
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:30,588
Sure thing, brother.

581
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,500
Okay, brother.

582
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:40,219
If this potion is as good as they say it is,

583
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,977
I guess I won't have to share the bag of gold.

584
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:00,580
What do you want?

585
00:57:01,0001 --> 00:57:03,453
I have no sense of family.

586
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:09,929
Oh, look!

587
00:57:13,895 --> 00:57:16,184
Who are you? And where's Getafix,

588
00:57:16,606 --> 00:57:17,602
...our druid?

589
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:21,310
Julius Caesar sent us to capture the druid.

590
00:57:21,696 --> 00:57:26,110
Our big brother double-crossed us to keep the reward.

591
00:57:26,536 --> 00:57:30,451
Without magic potion or Getafix, we're lost.

592
00:57:30,749 --> 00:57:33,206
- The sacred crocodiles, they... - Not again!

593
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:37,037
Let's go to Jules to get our druid.

594
00:57:37,508 --> 00:57:39,216
Alright, Asterix.

595
00:57:41,555 --> 00:57:44,972
Dogmatix, you're in charge of the construction site.

596
00:57:45,226 --> 00:57:46,425
Keep your eyes open.

597
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:55,363
One of the mercenaries has returned, O Caesar.

598
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:57,057
Let him enter.

599
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,411
Mission accomplished, O Caesar.

600
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:04,750
You have earned your keep, mercenary.

601
00:58:05,0005 --> 00:58:07,707
Here is the promised reward.

602
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:10,463
Let this Druid be locked up

603
00:58:10,717 --> 00:58:13,256
in the palace prison.

604
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:18,018
I am the cleverest!

605
00:58:18,268 --> 00:58:21,021
I am the richest! I am the richest...

606
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:25,563
Where is our druid?

607
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,608
Caesar has locked him up in the palace prison.

608
00:58:28,865 --> 00:58:30,823
Don't knock anymore, please.

609
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:36,698
- Let's go, Obelix. - Yes, Asterix.

610
00:58:37,543 --> 00:58:39,203
It's brother.

611
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:41,248
Come on, brother.

612
00:58:41,506 --> 00:58:45,045
Junior and I have a few words to say to you.

613
00:58:45,261 --> 00:58:46,257
Yeah.

614
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,049
I hope we find our Druid.

615
00:58:49,266 --> 00:58:51,972
You know, all prisons are the same.

616
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,898
It's just as easy to get in as it is to get out.

617
00:58:56,442 --> 00:58:58,435
Halt! We're not going in.

618
00:58:58,695 --> 00:59:01,531
- Yes, we're going in. - May I, Obelix?

619
00:59:01,866 --> 00:59:03,444
Excuse me.

620
00:59:10,585 --> 00:59:13,124
Asterix ! Obelix!

621
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,019
Out of the way, we're going out.

622
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,884
No, we're not going out.

623
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,636
Yes, we're going out.

624
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:34,234
Well yes, we go in and out.

625
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:59,728
How do you know? The druid is out of the prison?

626
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,646
These Gauls will know what it costs

627
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:05,393
to brave the wrath of Caesar, by Mercury !

628
01:00:05,947 --> 01:00:08,521
Tomorrow, when they wake up,

629
01:00:08,784 --> 01:00:13,744
I'll give them a little surprise and you'll tell me about it.

630
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,605
Master, master! The construction site is deserted.

631
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:44,408
The workers did not come this morning.

632
01:00:44,663 --> 01:00:46,046
What's going on?

633
01:00:46,457 --> 01:00:49,127
But what's going on now?

634
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:54,709
In the name of Caesar...

635
01:00:54,968 --> 01:00:59,133
Gallic dissidents are hiding in this yard.

636
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:02,133
We order them to surrender,

637
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:06,221
or else we'll attack, by Jupiter!

638
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:09,0009
We are here by the will of Cleopatra

639
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:12,149
and we will finish the work, by Toutatis!

640
01:01:12,574 --> 01:01:14,532
You will regret it, by Mercury!

641
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,361
What are we going to do, by Osiris?

642
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:20,197
To build defenses, by Belenos!

643
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:23,462
You are right, by Belisama!

644
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,665
Couldn't we go away, by any chance?

645
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:22,491
Attack!

646
01:02:55,997 --> 01:02:57,492
Back to the attack!

647
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,491
Join up, re-enlist, they said...

648
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:02,327
Here they come again!

649
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,293
To the attack!

650
01:03:35,715 --> 01:03:38,882
You will see the country, they said...

651
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,479
Attack!

652
01:03:55,907 --> 01:03:56,903
Hello!

653
01:03:57,159 --> 01:03:59,059
- What's wrong with you? - No kidding!

654
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:03,245
Since it's like that, we'll bomb them.

655
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,140
Look, war machines.

656
01:04:18,394 --> 01:04:21,349
Hmm, I don't like these things.

657
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:22,432
Fire!

658
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:38,618
My palate! They break my palace!

659
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:41,503
We should warn Cleopatra.

660
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:45,668
Only she can convince Caesar to stop the hostilities.

661
01:04:46,046 --> 01:04:47,425
Good idea.

662
01:04:47,723 --> 01:04:50,050
I'll write a message to the queen.

663
01:04:50,435 --> 01:04:52,891
It's Dogmatix who will carry the message.

664
01:04:53,147 --> 01:04:53,644
Dogmatix?

665
01:04:54,054 --> 01:04:55,310
But he's too small.

666
01:04:55,733 --> 01:04:57,057
No, it's not too small.

667
01:04:57,486 --> 01:05:00,938
Don't be stubborn. Dogmatix cannot carry the message.

668
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:03,322
Yes he can! Mr. Asterix knows everything.

669
01:05:03,827 --> 01:05:06,0006
Mr. Asterix, he must be in charge,

670
01:05:06,289 --> 01:05:07,831
Do you know what he's telling you, mister Asterix?

671
01:05:08,0008 --> 01:05:10,753
No, what is he telling me, mister Asterix?

672
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:12,201
Here's the message.

673
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:16,380
But how do we get it to him? We're under siege.

674
01:05:16,802 --> 01:05:20,635
Ask mister Asterix, he knows everything.

675
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:21,887
Come on, Obelix.

676
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:24,717
Don't be offended. I wanted to tease you.

677
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:26,351
No good, my dog...

678
01:05:26,773 --> 01:05:28,683
Dogmatix will carry the message.

679
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:30,390
And I'll carry Dogmatix.

680
01:05:30,945 --> 01:05:34,149
Alert! One of the besieged is trying to get through!

681
01:05:42,126 --> 01:05:44,119
He left as he came.

682
01:05:44,379 --> 01:05:46,253
He was just passing through.

683
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:05,690
Gauls come from afar to overwhelm me with hatred,

684
01:06:05,948 --> 01:06:08,654
I will show you how a queen dies.

685
01:06:09,0009 --> 01:06:12,162
- I will know... - But no, look. My dog

686
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:13,780
has a message for you.

687
01:06:14,014 --> 01:06:16,118
Oh, how sweet.

688
01:06:16,378 --> 01:06:19,333
Somebody bring a bone for this little dog.

689
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:23,625
It won't happen like that, by Osiris!

690
01:06:23,888 --> 01:06:25,631
Julius Caesar is a cheat.

691
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:29,851
Go, Gaul, I'll take care of everything.

692
01:06:30,438 --> 01:06:33,973
Alert! One of the besieged is trying to get in!

693
01:06:40,158 --> 01:06:44,044
And there you have it, Obelix. Dogmatix fulfilled his mission perfectly.

694
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,573
Ah, you see? Who was right?

695
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,166
Provided that Cleopatra acts quickly.

696
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,927
These machines will completely demolish the palace.

697
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,843
You see, Caesar?

698
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:04,182
Even without capturing those Gauls, the result will be the same

699
01:07:04,606 --> 01:07:06,149
because the palace will be destroyed.

700
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,396
Good, very good.

701
01:07:08,0008 --> 01:07:09,356
Hail Caesar!

702
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:12,400
There's someone here to see you...

703
01:07:33,033 --> 01:07:34,845
My Queen, what good wind?

704
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:36,266
Enough of this!

705
01:07:36,522 --> 01:07:40,437
I went out without changing when I heard the news.

706
01:07:40,944 --> 01:07:43,103
When you make a bet, you don't cheat.

707
01:07:43,364 --> 01:07:45,238
I've called on the Gauls.

708
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:48,778
I'll show you what my people are capable of.

709
01:07:49,205 --> 01:07:52,539
I demand that you leave the builders alone.

710
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,285
And let me tell you that...

711
01:07:55,713 --> 01:07:58,287
All right, I'm sorry.

712
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,831
Oh, all the same!

713
01:08:00,302 --> 01:08:02,0002
Go home, children.

714
01:08:15,015 --> 01:08:17,397
What do we do, O Caesar?

715
01:08:17,825 --> 01:08:20,363
We raise the siege, O fool!

716
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:45,810
The Romans lift the siege, by Belenos!

717
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:47,480
Victory, by Toutatis!

718
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:48,734
I'm very happy.

719
01:08:49,156 --> 01:08:50,900
All this thanks to my ldefix.

720
01:08:51,326 --> 01:08:52,820
And now, let's go to work !

721
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:56,951
And the work resumed, indeed.

722
01:08:57,208 --> 01:09:00,958
It resumed with determination because, let's not forget it,

723
01:09:01,213 --> 01:09:03,835
when the architect didn't respect his deadlines,

724
01:09:04,0004 --> 01:09:06,381
he was thrown to the crocodiles.

725
01:09:06,637 --> 01:09:10,303
An old custom, a little forgotten nowadays.

726
01:09:10,976 --> 01:09:13,265
Finally, one beautiful morning...

727
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:16,558
O my Queen, the palace is finished.

728
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:19,107
You kept your promise, Edifis.

729
01:09:19,361 --> 01:09:22,612
Cleopatra will keep hers, by Osiris.

730
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,616
Let them cover it with gold.

731
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:54,732
O my Queen, the most beautiful of Queens,

732
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,908
I have lost and I bow to your triumph.

733
01:09:58,328 --> 01:10:01,199
To you the honor of cutting this ribbon.

734
01:10:15,475 --> 01:10:17,384
I am indebted to you, Gaul,

735
01:10:17,644 --> 01:10:19,518
and you are entitled to my gratitude.

736
01:10:19,939 --> 01:10:23,023
You will return aboard my ceremonial galley

737
01:10:23,276 --> 01:10:25,186
with the thanks of Cleopatra.

738
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:28,817
You're welcome, Cleopatra. We salute you.

739
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:31,901
Will there be boars on your boat?

740
01:10:32,955 --> 01:10:33,702
Obelix.

741
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:36,913
He always has to yell at me.

742
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:39,921
A ceremonial galley without boars,

743
01:10:40,173 --> 01:10:42,296
It's not worth...

744
01:10:56,569 --> 01:10:59,773
Everyone eats, everyone drinks,

745
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:02,484
everyone is happy

746
01:11:02,743 --> 01:11:05,615
and celebrates the happy outcome of this adventure.

747
01:11:05,872 --> 01:11:08,578
Everyone drinks, everyone eats.

748
01:11:09,0009 --> 01:11:10,206
Everybody?

749
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:12,668
Well, almost everyone.

750
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:26,026
And with the spring,

751
01:11:26,357 --> 01:11:30,652
Cleopatra's magnificent ship approaches the coast of Gaul,

752
01:11:32,406 --> 01:11:34,648
where the village welcomes its heroes

753
01:11:34,909 --> 01:11:38,528
with its usual enthusiasm and banquet.

754
01:11:46,632 --> 01:11:49,255
And it was ldéfix who did it all.

755
01:11:49,845 --> 01:11:53,974
A nose, my dear, a nose!

756
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:13,538
Subtitling CEDRA
