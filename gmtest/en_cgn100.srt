1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,168
i have chosen batumi instead of tbilisi because i thought it would be cheaper to rent an apartment and batumi

2
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:20,336
easy it's very easy to go to batumi from turkey well no like you still need

3
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:30,505
to to use the plane and it's not that much different it's not that different because you still flag fly

4
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:40,673
from eastanbul and turkey is huge in size steel so ye and so

5
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:50,842
i spent one month in turkey then two months in georgia and the reason why i decided to relocate

6
00:00:50,842 --> 00:01:01,010
to armenia is just because georgia does not give residents permits to russians because like their policy is

7
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:11,178
that well you can stay here for the whole year and then you do a visa ran so you don't need a residence permit so and i really

8
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:21,347
really need that because i eventually want to go to europe that's my that's my dream and

9
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:31,515
and then so it was a tough choice because i could have stayed in georgia and

10
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:41,684
yah like work and work from there and make a lot of like mine for georgia

11
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:51,852
by georgian standards like really really a lot but i decided that no i better go to armenia and

12
00:01:51,852 --> 00:02:02,020
in the future i move to europe so europe it is better even even despite that it involves

13
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:12,189
relocation and it involves losses in in terms of relative income because everything in europe is

14
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:22,357
more expensive than compare to georgia and armenia but still like europe is used but anyway salaries are also in

15
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:32,526
on my research poland for example is not that expensive like

16
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:42,694
warso the capital of poland is comparable to prewar moscow

17
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:52,862
as makes sense here i think i think you here oh well yeah i think her pollent isn't

18
00:02:52,862 --> 00:03:03,031
real very expensive cherubino is quite inexpensive my friend she moved to

19
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:13,199


20
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:23,368
because it's cheaper than prague chia

21
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:33,536
as far as i know chieh republic is well maybe it's more expensive borland does not

22
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:43,704
that expensive anyway countries like germany and ethel yeah i know that like netherlands

23
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:53,873
netherlands is just crazy and i actually have a friend from the netherlands and i speak dutch at about that level

24
00:03:53,873 --> 00:04:04,041
it's basically useless

25
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:14,210
like i told you already that i am basically a language nord and is so i actually i

26
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:24,378
really love foreign languages like human languages more than programming once that's why i have got a developer and i've never been a developer

27
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:34,546
m but can you actually code

28
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:44,715
stuff i think no i studied applied informatics at the university here in ranova

29
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:54,883
and actually we can be we heads like we had subjects like basics of programming i can know a little

30
00:04:54,883 --> 00:05:05,052
as the theoretical and very very primitive on the level and only to cease sharp that ames says little

31
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:15,220
beats

32
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:25,389
not parent but p h p but it's very very weak very basic at very very life can

33
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:35,557
and a lot

34
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:45,725
of people who graduated from who studied software engineering work here in aquilmworked in a wonderful office

35
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:55,894
out of software engineers and they they can really they can really code but i can't and actually programming

36
00:05:55,894 --> 00:06:06,062
has always been a challenge for me even when i got prepared even when i prepared for the

37
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:16,231
unified state exam and i didn't i didn't do the tasks

38
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:26,399
states en there is a task i think in my time in

39
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:36,567
my types it was the last one it is the most difficult related to write some code but i never did it but anyway i know

40
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:46,736
i've never been i will never be a programmer that's quite hard for me and actually

41
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:56,904
if wide in cosmetics it's it's like system analysis business analysis my be a project manager that's a

42
00:06:56,904 --> 00:07:07,073
kate yes i went to

43
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:17,241
all this it shield because i didn't know what to do what to study after school and actually i

44
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:27,409
ones

45
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:37,578
i got good results like seventy nine points

46
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:47,746
for me that was really good and that it and i've answered the first years at the university i didn't really understand

47
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:57,915
what we would become after

48
00:07:57,915 --> 00:08:08,083
graduation and also i studied there how university studied the translation courses like an additional program

49
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:18,251
and i received two two non diplomas

50
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:28,420
well i'm a bachelor in a flat informatics and and i'm also a translator and when i took

51
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:38,588
the final exam irina are national ovo head now its bumbaoffice then it was ivan aches

52
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:48,757
head of at otic she was in she was at that exam and she invited me

53
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:58,925
how i started my career in at

54
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:09,093
it started two weeks before the global locked down begin to twenty twenty

55
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:19,262
ah all right one second one second i need to do one thing

56
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:29,430
so so i decided to

57
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:39,599
stop the recording and reload it so to make sure that the file is saved and now is recording the new

58
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:49,767
file because maybe maybe there will be issues with abies later

59
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:59,935
so just to just be safe at least south no to everything in case ye so you
