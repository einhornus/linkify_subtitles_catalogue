1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,306
I HAVE CHOSEN BATOMI INSTEAD OF BELISY BECAUSE I

2
00:00:03,306 --> 00:00:05,589
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,634
PER DOR ANT AN APARTMENT IN BATOMIA

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,678
I'M HERE SINCE IT'S SO EASIER

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,976
IT'S VERY EASY TO GO TO BATUMIPHONE TURKEY

6
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:19,812
AH HELEN WILLER WILL KNOW YOU LIKE

7
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,812
NTO TO USE

8
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:25,562
THAT

9
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:28,062


10
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,813
DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU STILL FLYK FLY FROM EASTERN WALLE

11
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:33,813
TURKEYIS HUGE IN SIZE

12
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:36,813


13
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:39,563
SO I

14
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:43,813
SPENT ONE MONTH IN TURKEY THEN TWO

15
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:46,563
MONTHS I IN A GEORGIA AND THE

16
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:49,313
REASON WHY I DECIDED TO A

17
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:52,313
I JUST

18
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:56,313
BECAUSE GEORGE DOESN'T GIVE PRESIDENT PERMITZ TO RUSSIANS

19
00:00:56,313 --> 00:00:59,813
NA BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THEYRE

20
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:02,087
POLICYIS THAT VALUE YOU CAN STAY HERE

21
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:06,635
FOR THE WHOLE YEAR AND THEN YOU'LL DO A VISERON AND SO YOU DON'T NEED A RESIDENCE

22
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,656
A

23
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:13,203
SO AND I REALLY REALLY NEED THAT BECAUSE I EVENTUALLY WANT

24
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:17,498
TO GO TO A EUROPE AH THAT'S MY THAT'S MOY DREAM

25
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:22,358
A AND THEN AM

26
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:27,229
SO I IT WAS A TOUGH

27
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,251
CHOICE BECAUSE I COULD HAVE STAYED IN A

28
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:32,517


29
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:35,539
WORKING AND WORK FROM THEIR END

30
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:38,057
ON A LOT

31
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,834
OF FER LIKE MINE IN FOR A GEORGIA

32
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:46,115
LIKE BY GEORGEON STANDARDS LIKE REALLY REALLY A LOT A BUT

33
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:48,884
I DECIDED THAT NO I BETTER

34
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:51,906
THO ID BETTER GO TO ARMENIA AND

35
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:56,360
IN THE FUTURE I LIKE MOVE TO EUROPE SO LIKE EUROPUS

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,879
IT IS BETTER EVEN EVEN DESPITE AH THAT

37
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,644
IT INVOLVES RELAXATION AND IT

38
00:02:04,644 --> 00:02:07,908
IN THE WOLVES ARE LOTUS IN

39
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:11,674
AM IN TERMS OF A RELATIVE AND CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING AND EUROPES

40
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,682
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

41
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:17,448
COMPARED TO GEORGA AND THE ARMENIA BUT STILL LIKE EUROPESENTA

42
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:20,712
NOR BUT ANNWITH CELERIES ARE ALSO

43
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,095
I AM THERE

44
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,974
LITTE IT WAS I AT

45
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:28,761
AND ALSO A BASED ON MY RESEARCH

46
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:32,295
POLAND FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE ARIT

47
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:35,829
YABO LIKE A VOR

48
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,849
SO THE CAPITALS POLLEN

49
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,130
OF POLAND IS COMPARABLE TO PREVAR MOSCOW

50
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:42,801
O

51
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:45,940
