1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
chosen batumi instead of tbilisi because i thought it would be cheaper to rent an apartment than bat

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
it's easier it's very easy to go to betome from turkey helen well like you

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
still fly

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
from eastern bullet turkeys huge are in size so

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
i spent one month in turkey then two months in georgia and the reason why i decided to

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
relocate to armenia it is just because georgia doesn't give residence permits to russians because their

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,001
policy is that while you can stay here for the whole year and then you'll do a wiser and and so you don't need that

8
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:20,001
because i eventually want to go to europe that's my small dream

9
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:30,001
and it it was a tough choice because i could have stayed

10
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:40,001
in georgia and workwork from there and make a lot of like money

11
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:50,001
id better better go

12
00:01:50,001 --> 00:02:00,001
to armenia and the future like move to europe so like europe it is better even

13
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:10,002
despite that it involves relocation and it involves are loses in in form of a

14
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:20,002
relative and can be caserta in europe are also

15
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:30,002
based on my research poland for example

16
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:40,002
is not that expensive like worse the capital of sentis comparable to

17
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:50,002
pre-war mose i think i think

18
00:02:50,002 --> 00:03:00,002
isn't very very expensive chichi republic is quite an expensive

19
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:10,003
my friend she moved to burn about three years ago

20
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:20,003
and she chose berno because it's cheaper than prag

21
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:30,003
as far as i know cherubim be

22
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:40,003
is more expensive than or expensive anyway countries like german

23
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:50,003
the crazy and i actually have a friend from i speak

24
00:03:50,003 --> 00:04:00,003
dutch at about eight level i'm so sad that now

25
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:10,004
it's basically languish nor

26
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:20,004
and i actually i really love foreign languages like human languages more than programming once

27
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:30,004
that's what i have not to develop and i've never been a developer yes so you

28
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:40,004
actually cold stuff i think no i studied

29
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:50,004
to apply informatics at the university here in vanward and actually can we we had subjects

30
00:04:50,004 --> 00:05:00,004
like basics of programming i can know a little at the theoretic at a very very primitive one level

31
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:10,005
see see sharpers little gels network not the

32
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:20,005
back and as cut that works on ten olence assassin little beat not fatoutbut it's a very very like farmer

33
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:30,005
basic at very very low level is very lignactually and we

34
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:40,005
also had the department of software engineering and a lot of lot of people who graduated from who

35
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:50,005
studied software engineers they

36
00:05:50,005 --> 00:06:00,005
they really they can rarely code but actually actually actually programming has always been a challenge for

37
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:10,006
the unified state exam

38
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:20,006
i didn't i didn't do the tasks the these they are

39
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:30,006
into the most difficult

40
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:40,006
some basics anyway

41
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:50,006
i decided i never i will never be a programmer this hard for me and actually it incomaticsits like

42
00:06:50,006 --> 00:07:00,006
the it system analysis in project mall

43
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:10,007
i went to i went to own a shield because i

44
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:20,007
didn't know what to do or to study house school and actually

45
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:30,007
to prepare a lot for the university examine during the tenth and eleventh once a

46
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:40,007
good results like seventy nine points that was really good

47
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:50,007
and i answer first years at the university i didn't understand what we

48
00:07:50,007 --> 00:08:00,007
started there what would what we would become after graduation

49
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:10,008
and also i perceived

50
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:20,008
two uniforms

51
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:30,008
bachanalians and i and i'm also a translator and when i took the final

52
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:40,008
exil a irina national yo head of now papal office and was one office head off

53
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:50,008
at office she was in the s was at that exam and she invited me

54
00:08:50,008 --> 00:09:00,008
after that examine that's why how started my career in it it was started

55
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:10,008
two weeks before the globe worked out in ten twenty

56
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:20,009
one second one second i need to do one thing ah

57
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:30,009
so i decided to

58
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:40,009
stop the recording and reloaded so to make sure that the file is saved and now its recording the new

59
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:50,009
file because maybe maybe there will be issues with obese later

60
00:09:50,009 --> 00:10:00,009
so to just to just be safe easy
