1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,687
i have chosen batumi instead of tbilisi because i thought it would be cheaper to rent an apartment and batumi sense easier it's very easy to go to batumi from turkey well no you still need

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:41,374
to to use the plane and it's not that much different it's not that different because you still fly from eastanbul and turkey is huge in size steel so and so i spent one

3
00:00:41,374 --> 00:01:02,062
month in turkey then two months in georgia and the reason why i decided to relocate to armenia is just because georgia does not give residents permits to russians because like their policy is that well you can stay here

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:22,749
for the whole year and then you do a visa ran and so you don't need a residence pyramid so and i really really need that because i eventually want t go to europe that's my that's my dream and and then

5
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:43,437
so it was a tough choice because i could have stayed in georgia and yeah and work from there and make a lot of like many for georgia by georgian standards

6
00:01:43,437 --> 00:02:04,124
like really really a lot but i decided that no i better go to armenia and in the future i move to europe so europe it is better even even despite that it involves relocation and

7
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:24,812
armenia but still like europe is use but anyway salaries are also

8
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:45,499
based on my research poland for example is not that expensive like warso the almost makes sense yet i

9
00:02:45,499 --> 00:03:06,187
think i think well yeah i think poland isn't very very expensive cheek republic none is quite inexpensive my friend as she moved to burn about three years ago

10
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:26,874
yes and she chose pernod because it's cheaper than prag chichi think as far as late know

11
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:47,561
cherch republic is just croatia and i actually have a friend from the

12
00:03:47,561 --> 00:04:08,249
netherlands and i am so so sad that now it's basically useless like i told you already that i am

13
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:28,936
basically a developer and they have never been a developer yes so you are a

14
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:49,624
stuff i think no i studied applied informatics at the university here in ranova and actually we had like we had subjects

15
00:04:49,624 --> 00:05:10,311
like basics of programming i can you know a little as the theoretical and a very very primitive on level and only to sychar nelse says little jew script that works with not the back and

16
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:30,999
i camoscript that works on each timl in cs little beats not bite but h p but it's very very basic at very very low level actually as we started to make a pliant

17
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:51,686
informatics and we also had the departments of software engineering and a lot of lot of people who graduated from who studied software engineering work here in equal worked in an office a lot of software engineers and they they can really they can read

18
00:05:51,686 --> 00:06:12,374
the cold but i can't and actually actually coding actually programming has always been a challenge for me even when i got prepared even when i prepared for the unified state exam and i didn't

19
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:33,061
i didn't do the task this vary in the unified states en there is a task i think in my time in my types it was the last one less the most difficult related to rate some code

20
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:53,748
but i never did it but anyway i know some basic anyway i decided i've never i will never be a programmer that's quite hard for me and actually if it in chromatics it's it's like system analysis business analysis

21
00:06:53,748 --> 00:07:14,436
may distinct from may be a project manager that's okay

22
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:35,123
and actually i just prepared a lot for the university exam during the tenth and the eleventh forms i fasted i got good results like seventy

23
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:55,811
nine points for me that was really good and that's it and i've answer the first years at the university i didn't really understand what would what we would

24
00:07:55,811 --> 00:08:16,498
become after graduation and also i studied the how university studied the translation courses like an additional programme and i received two

25
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:37,186
non diplomas well so i'm i'm a bachelor in a plate informatics and and i'm also a translator and when i took the final exam irina r national ovah of now it's bumped

26
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:57,873
oshis then it was ivan watches head of that office she was in the she was at that examined she invited me to an interview after that examine that's how i started my career

27
00:08:57,873 --> 00:09:18,561
in at it started two weeks before the global locked down begin to twenty twenty all right one second one second i need to do one thing

28
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:39,248
so so i decided to stop the recording and reload it so to make sure that defile is saved and now is tricorn the

29
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:59,935
new file because maybe maybe there will be issues with abies later just to just be safe at least not to ever so yeah so you
