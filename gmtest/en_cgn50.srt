1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,041
i have chosen batumi instead of tbilisi because i thought it would be

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:10,082
cheaper to orient an partner and bottom

3
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:15,124
in es sense its east's very easy to go to batumi from turkey

4
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:20,165
of stolen well no like you still

5
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:25,207
need to to use the plane and it's not

6
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:30,248
that different because you still flag

7
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:35,290
fire from istanbul and turkey's huge in size

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,331
steel so ye and

9
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,373
so i spent one month in turkey then two months in

10
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:50,414
georgia and the reason why i decided to relocate to

11
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:55,456
armenia is just because georgia doesn't give residents permits

12
00:00:55,456 --> 00:01:00,497
to russians because like their policies

13
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:05,539
that well you can stay here for the whole year and then you do a visa ran and so

14
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:10,580
you don't need a residence permit so and

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,622
i really really need that because i eventually want to go to europe

16
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:20,663
that's my that's my dream and

17
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:25,705
and then so it was

18
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:30,746
tough choice because i could have stayed in georgia

19
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:35,788
and yeah like work and work from there

20
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:40,829
and make a lot of like mine for

21
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,871
georgia by georgian standards like really really a lot

22
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:50,912
but i decided that no i better go to armenia and

23
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:55,954
in the future i move to europe so like europe

24
00:01:55,954 --> 00:02:00,995
is it is better even even despite that

25
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:06,036
it involves relocation and it involves

26
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:11,078
losses in in terms of reality of income because everything

27
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:16,119
in europe is more expensive than compared to georgia and armenia

28
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:21,161
but still like europe is un but anyway salaries are also

29
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:26,202


30
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:31,244
based on my research poland for example is not that expensive

31
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:36,285
like warso

32
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:41,327
the capital of poland is comparable to prewar moscow

33
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:46,368
as makes sense yet i

34
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:51,410
think here

35
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,451
it isn't rare they are expensive thinker

36
00:02:56,451 --> 00:03:01,493
publicly i know is quite inexpensive my friend

37
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:06,534
she moved to berno about three years ago

38
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:11,576
yes and she

39
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:16,617
chose pernod because it's cheaper than prague

40
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:21,659
well armed

41
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,700
as far as late know

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,742
chich republic is well maybe it's more expensive than

43
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:36,783
poland not that expensive but

44
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:41,825
anyway countries like germany and then the lands to not ye not like

45
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:46,866
netherlands netherlands is just crazy and i actually have a friend from

46
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:51,908
the netherlands and i speak dutch but

47
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:56,949
the antulevel great yeah

48
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:01,990
and i'm so so sad that now it's basically useless

49
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,032
like i told you already that i

50
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:12,073
am basically a language north and

51
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:17,115
is so my actually i really love foreign languages like human languages

52
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:22,156
more than programming once that's why i have not a developer

53
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:27,198
and i have never been a developer ah yes so you are

54
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:32,239
a p m but can

55
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:37,281
you actually cold stuff i think no

56
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:42,322
i studied applied informatics at the

57
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:47,364
university here in ranee and actually we can be

58
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:52,405
we had subjects like basics of programming

59
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:57,447
i can know a little as the theoretical de

60
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:02,488
and only to see so sharp

61
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:07,530
elsie says little bit jeoscript that

62
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,571
works with not the back and la camascript that were grown each stimulant

63
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:17,613
the assassin little beats not pine but h p

64
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:22,654
but it's very very low

65
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:27,696
and actually and

66
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:32,737
we also had the departments

67
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:37,779
of software engineering and a lot of people

68
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,820
who gradiated who studied software engineering for career and

69
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,862
equalan worked in a baneful office out of software engineers

70
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:52,903
and they they can really they can really cold but i

71
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:57,945
can't and actually actually coding actually programming has

72
00:05:57,945 --> 00:06:02,986
always been a challenge for me even when i got

73
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:08,027
prepared even when i prepared for the unified state exam

74
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:13,069
and i didn't i i

75
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:18,110
didn't do the task the

76
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,152
these are very but in the unified states set there is a

77
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:28,193
task i think in my time in my types it was the last one

78
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:33,235
as the most difficult related to rate some code but

79
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:38,276
i never never did it but anyway i know some basic

80
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:43,318
point anyway i decided that i've never been i will never be a programmer

81
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:48,359
that's quite hard for me and actually a void in cometic it's

82
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:53,401
it's like system analysis business analysis

83
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:58,442
may distant from they be a project manager that's a ca ye i bussian

84
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:03,484
actually

85
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:08,525
i went to event to all this it shield

86
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:13,567
because i didn't know what to do or to study how

87
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:18,608
to school and actually i

88
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:23,650
just prepared a lot for the universitat examined

89
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,691
during the tenth and the eleventh once i

90
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:33,733
was to take you i got a good results like

91
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:38,774
seventy nine points for me that was

92
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:43,816
really good and that it and the answer first

93
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:48,857
years at the university i didn't really understand what what

94
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:53,899
we what we started there

95
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:58,940
what we would become after graduation

96
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,981
and also i studied there arnstead to the translation

97
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:09,023
course is like an additional program and

98
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:14,064
i received two

99
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:19,106
on diplomas well

100
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:24,147
i have so i more i'm a bachelor in flat informatics and

101
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:29,189
and i'm also a translator and when i took

102
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:34,230
the final exam irina ideational yoga

103
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:39,272
head of

104
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:44,313
that aches she was in the

105
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:49,355
oh she was at that examined she invited me

106
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:54,396


107
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:59,438
that's how i started my career in it it started

108
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:04,479
two weeks before the global locked down

109
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:09,521
work in twenty twenty

110
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:14,562
right one second one second i need to do

111
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:19,604
in

112
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:24,645
i

113
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:29,687
so i decided to

114
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:34,728
stop the recording and reload it so to make sure that

115
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:39,770
defile is saved and now it sericorian the new

116
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,811
file because maybe maybe there

117
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:49,853
will be issues with obus later

118
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:54,894
so just to just be safe at least

119
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:59,935
south no tools everything in case ye so
