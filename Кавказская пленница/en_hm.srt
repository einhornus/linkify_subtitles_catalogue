19
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:37,747
Shurik told us this story.

20
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,959
During vacation
he hunted for folklore -

21
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,127
local legends and myths.

22
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:46,171
This story may well be a legend

23
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:49,340
but Shurik says it really happened

24
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:51,800
in one of the mountainous areas.

25
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,844
He didn't say which one

26
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:57,680
not to be unfair to other places

27
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:01,850
where the story
might have happened.

28
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:10,691
Giddi yap!

29
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:56,352
Cursed be the day
when I mounted this hoover.

30
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:58,147
Don't despair.

31
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:07,445
As the first driver of this car,
the great and wise

32
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,572
Abu-Ahmad ibn-bay,
said, take care, Edik.

33
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:12,658
- Edik.
- Sasha.

34
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:15,951
Allah only knows
what happens to the spark

35
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:18,579
of this unworthy bastard

36
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:21,748
in the fine family of
internal combustion engines.

37
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,917
May its carburettor wither
and fall off!

38
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:03,372
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

39
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:05,332
Excuse me.

40
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:09,294
- Do me a favor.
- Yes?

41
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:13,298
Will you walk straight on and on.

42
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:17,509
- Why?
- My donkey's following you.

43
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:20,595
So it's he who's pursuing me?

44
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:22,305
That's him alright.

45
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,014
- I thought--
- No, it's him.

46
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,435
Are you local?

47
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:32,813
- Yes. I'm here on vacation.
- I'm here on business.

48
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,981
- Is it a long way to town?
- About 2 km.

49
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:38,234
- Thanks and bye.
- All the best.

50
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,278
Whoa.

51
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:46,700
He won't move without you.

52
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,538
- Year of birth?
- 1942.

53
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,668
- Purpose of visit?
- Ethnographic expedition.

54
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:03,004
- Prospecting for oil?
- Not really.

55
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,924
I'm studying folklore,

56
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:08,509
collecting tales, legends, toasts.

57
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:10,010
Toasts?

58
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:15,014
You're lucky, dear.
I'll help you.

59
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:16,682
LUNCH BREAK

60
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:19,893
What's that?

61
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,061
You want a toast.

62
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,105
A toast without wine

63
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,357
is like a nuptial bed
without the bride.

64
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,859
- Thanks, but I don't drink.
- Do I?

65
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:32,528
What's there to drink?

66
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,573
You don't understand.

67
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:39,033
I don't drink at all.

68
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:41,285
I can't physically.

69
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:45,038
Here's the first toast.

70
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,917
- Let me write it down.
- Later.

71
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,876
Take the glass.

72
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,213
My great granddad says:

73
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:59,717
I have a wish to buy a house

74
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:02,136
but I've no means.

75
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:05,847
I've means to buy a goat
but I've no wish.

76
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,933
May our wishes

77
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:13,853
always match our means.

78
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,830
Attaboy.

79
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,416
Here's another toast.

80
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,464
- I'll be back.
- It's alright.

81
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,384
I'll take some fresh air.
I spend all day

82
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,470
in the office.

83
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:10,192
- Where were you?
- Why do you ask?

84
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:13,152
- This is my niece.
- How do you do.

85
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,445
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Nina.

86
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,198
She's a student
at a teachers training college.

87
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:20,657
She'll teach our successors.

88
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:23,369
An A-student, a Young Communist,
an athlete.

89
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:25,829
Uncle knows everything about me.

90
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:29,081
An A-student and a Young Communist.
Just what we need.

91
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:32,251
- And what do you need?
- I've got--

92
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:35,085
a surprise question.

93
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:38,339
What do you think of marriage?

94
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:41,716
- Well, I'm all for it.
- Too early to think about it.

95
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:45,344
It's never too early or too late
to think about it.

96
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,180
Start the engine.

97
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:51,224
What if I ask you to open
the Marriage Palace?

98
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:53,726
I'll be there, I promise.

99
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,521
There's an assignment for you.

100
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,648
- What assignment?
- Come and see.

101
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,608
Okay.

102
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,909
When the flock flew southward

103
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:16,787
for winter

104
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:20,999
one small but proud bird said:

105
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,461
"I'm flying to the sun."

106
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:31,340
It soared up

107
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,052
but soon it singed its wings

108
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:38,012
and fell into

109
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:40,348
a very deep canyon.

110
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:45,894
May none of us,

111
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,813
no matter how high we fly,

112
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,815
break ties...

113
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,694
with the work collective.

114
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:58,363
- What's up?
- What is it, dear?

115
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:03,075
I'm sorry for the bird.

116
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,576
The infuriated princess

117
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:08,580
hung herself on her own plait,

118
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,914
cos he said how many grains were

119
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:14,000
in the bag
and how many drops in the sea

120
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,793
and how many stars in the sky.

121
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:18,128
Here's to cybernetics!

122
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,178
Your health!

123
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:33,182
Your health!

124
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,270
MARRIAGE PALACE

125
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:56,285
Dear friends,

126
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:59,871
today is a joyful,

127
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,665
bright and sunny holiday.

128
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:05,584
A few seconds later

129
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,085
these silver scissors

130
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,338
will cut this crimson silk ribbon

131
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,133
and open for the newly-weds
of our district

132
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,511
a straight road
to the bright future,

133
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,181
to happiness, love and harmony,
you see...

134
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,518
through our Marriage Palace.

135
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:37,234
The honor of opening the palace...

136
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:39,778
We have conferred here

137
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:44,324
and decided to grant the honor
of opening the palace

138
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:48,285
to the beautiful woman,

139
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:50,953
to the girl whose fate

140
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:57,166
embodies the new status
of female mountain dwellers.

141
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:00,420
It's a student,

142
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,548
a Young Communist, an athlete

143
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:07,175
and last but not least, a beauty.

144
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:17,518
This is my assignment.

145
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:41,704
To quote our renowned satirist,

146
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:45,539
"A woman is a friend to man."

147
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,377
Hold on, speak slowly please.

148
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:53,128
- I'm putting this down.
- Who is it?

149
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,007
- The media probably.
- Oh, the media!

150
00:12:56,924 --> 00:13:00,678
So... To quote
our renowned satirist,

151
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:04,305
- "A woman is a friend to man."
- Great!

152
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:06,849
Here's to the women.

153
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:12,520
Give me the horn, now.

154
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:23,779
...He disrupted the solemn opening
of the Marriage Palace.

155
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,532
Then on the ruins of the chapel...

156
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:30,994
Did I ruin the chapel?

157
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,288
No, that was before you,
in the 14th century.

158
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,290
...On the ruins of the chapel...

159
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,668
Quite so. This is true.

160
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:45,172
It's written correctly.
It's all right.

161
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:48,341
On one hand.

162
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,885
But there is the other side
of the medal.

163
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:54,262
The wrongdoer is not a wrongdoer

164
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,722
but an eminent research worker,

165
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,350
a worker by brain.

166
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,351
He has come to us, okay?

167
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:05,188
To collect our myths, legends,

168
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,982
you see... toasts.

169
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,110
- Toasts?
- Yes, toasts.

170
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:14,696
But he hit more
than he could chew, right?

171
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,573
We are dealing here

172
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,783
with an industrial accident.

173
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:26,122
I've got a wonderful toast.

174
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:35,379
You have a wrong idea
about our parts.

175
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:38,924
As we all know, Kuzbass is--

176
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:42,260
...national smithy.

177
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:45,346
Kuban is a national granary.

178
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:48,056
And the Caucasus is a national what?

179
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,391
Health resort!

180
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:54,895
Wrong! It's a national smithy,

181
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,647
granary and health resort.

182
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,233
Where have you been?

183
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,651
There's a great toast.
Excuse me.

184
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,987
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

185
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,823
We'll talk to Shurik
and you write down your toast

186
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:12,076
in three copies for me.

187
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,453
Yes, sir!

188
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:20,332
I'd like to see an old ritual

189
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,209
or, better still, take part in it.

190
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:26,754
My, look around, okay?

191
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:29,298
You won't see
those grandpa's customs

192
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,966
and grandma's rituals.
Not in our parts.

193
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:35,386
Maybe high up in the mountains...

194
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:39,223
you might find something
for your science.

195
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:42,058
- Let's climb the mountains.
- Right.

196
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,268
That's your job, okay?

197
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:47,563
You are here to collect tales

198
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:52,149
and we here work to make them
a reality you see.

199
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:55,361
- Oh yes.
- I've brought the toast.

200
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:01,157
- Is it bad?
- Yes.

201
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:05,202
- What's the big idea?
- You said 3 copies.

202
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,877
To live, so to say, is good.

203
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,005
But to live well is even better.

204
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,715
You've said it!

205
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,509
Manager
Comrade Saakhov

206
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,551
For shame!

207
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:21,847
Are you trying to harm the orphan
who only has an aunt and uncle?

208
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:24,433
- Twenty five.
- You're wrong.

209
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:28,770
I respect your niece
but there's a limit to it.

210
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,023
- Eighteen.
- Have a heart!

211
00:17:32,774 --> 00:17:35,859
You're getting a wife, not a goat.

212
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,321
She's a student, a Young Communist,
and athlete and a beauty -

213
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,450
all for 25 sheep.

214
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:48,494
- It's absurd to haggle.
- Those are apolitical ideas.

215
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:52,623
I swear, honestly, you don't see
the political situation.

216
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:56,585
You see life through the window
of my personal car.

217
00:17:57,336 --> 00:17:59,294
Twenty-five sheep at a time
when our district

218
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,631
hasn't yet reckoned
with our country.

219
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,009
Don't mix what's yours
with the country's.

220
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:11,681
Comrade Jambrail,
I was sent here

221
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:15,892
to take care of the state interests.

222
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:18,811
Sit for a while.

223
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,609
To sum up...

224
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:32,072
- 20 sheep.
- 25.

225
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,448
Twenty.

226
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:39,327
A Finnish vacuum cleaner.
A letter of commendation.

227
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,789
- And a free voucher.
- To Siberia.

228
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,463
- Okay.
- Okay.

229
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,384
So...

230
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:00,553
The bridegroom has consented,

231
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:03,263
his family too.

232
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,641
As for the bride...

233
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:10,478
We don't bring up our youngers well,

234
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,270
we don't.

235
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:15,648
They are not serious
about marriage.

236
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:19,235
Anyway, why should I ask the bride?

237
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:22,946
Throw a bag on her head and--

238
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:25,406
That's right.

239
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:28,743
The right decision.

240
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,621
But leave me out of this.

241
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:36,833
Don't worry.
Other guys will do it.

242
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:42,213
- Not from our district.
- Sure.

243
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:45,756
DANCE SCHOOL
PAYMENT - ONE RUBLE

244
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:49,259
This not your lezginka.
This is twist.

245
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,720
I show you all over again.

246
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:55,138
Press the butt with the toe
of your right foot.

247
00:19:58,142 --> 00:19:59,934
The toe of your left foot

248
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,604
presses the second butt,

249
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:07,816
now press the two butts at once.

250
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:05,196
MULTI-PLAY DOMINO SESSION
PAYMENT - ONE RUBLE

251
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:42,726
Game over.

252
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,384
- Did you sell her?
- That's my business.

253
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,470
Hold on.

254
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,722
Move to the right!

255
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,517
Go!

256
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:36,145
Get the sheep to the shed
and the fridge inside.

257
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,274
What are you up to?

258
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:51,073
- Go home.
- It won't work.

259
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,285
Stealing such a girl!

260
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:56,994
An athlete, a Young Communist!

261
00:22:57,996 --> 00:22:59,498
One guy

262
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:02,208
in the neighboring district
walked away

263
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:04,793
with a Party member!

264
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:29,229
You're making progress.
Great progress.

265
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,816
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

266
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,858
Just securing myself.

267
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:38,820
Okay, I'll give you a more
difficult assignment.

268
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,282
Like what?

269
00:23:42,783 --> 00:23:44,867
- Get packed in a sleeping bag.
- Right.

270
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:48,579
Quickly... Hold it... Now.

271
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:51,706
Ready.

272
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:53,958
Steady. Go.

273
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:09,220
Done.

274
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:13,057
Are you gonna sleep on your feet?

275
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,893
- Now.
- Yes, yes.

276
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:19,563
Careful.

277
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:27,152
Hold on, I'll pull you out.

278
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,115
There are two of them.

279
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:19,910
The other's with a tail.

280
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:23,079
The donkey doesn't count.
The second's one too many.

281
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:25,748
- A witness.
- What if--

282
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,085
- No casualties please.
- Let's wait.

283
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:33,421
Yes, let's wait. You deal.

284
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:50,310
Is it folklore too?

285
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:52,771
No, it's a student song.

286
00:26:53,104 --> 00:26:55,022
About Polar bears.

287
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,525
- You don't want it.
- Why not?

288
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:00,234
It's student folklore. Go ahead.

289
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:02,987
Okay.

290
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:13,079
There's a place on the globe

291
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:15,497
Where it is freezing cold,

292
00:27:15,998 --> 00:27:17,415
Where the Polar bears

293
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,000
Rub against the Pole.

294
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,294
Ages and centuries float by,

295
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:24,670
Under the ice sleep seas.

296
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:27,006
Meanwhile the Polar bears

297
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:29,299
Keep rotating the earth.

298
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,608
The bears work with purpose

299
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:52,026
Spinning the earth with might

300
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:54,321
So that future lovers

301
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:56,572
Meet each other might.

302
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,801
Bye, Shurik. You go straight on

303
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:06,969
and I go to the base.

304
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:10,806
And thank you.

305
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,809
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

306
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:33,116
Nina!

307
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,953
- Wait!
- What?

308
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:40,080
Let me see you off.

309
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:00,930
You didn't justify

310
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,849
our confidence.

311
00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:08,437
- How can we work?
- Your plan is unrealistic.

312
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:10,480
It's... er...

313
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:14,232
Voluntarism!

314
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:18,819
Mind your language

315
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:21,405
in my home!

316
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:23,781
What did I say?

317
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:30,746
Here's your prepayment.

318
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,873
We quit!

319
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:41,171
- Take it.
- Wait a minute.

320
00:31:51,555 --> 00:31:54,057
It's alright.

321
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:57,059
The guy who is in our way

322
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,145
will help us.

323
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:09,069
Now you are talking.

324
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:11,780
- We're with you.
- Get ready.

325
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,588
- Come here!
- Do it, you oaf!

326
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,237
Whosee shoee?

327
00:33:02,654 --> 00:33:04,655
Minee... Thanks.

328
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,368
Let's go.

329
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:18,458
Go. It's getting late.

330
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,004
See you don't lose your way.

331
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:29,760
Please go.

332
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,684
Comrade Shurik?

333
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,978
- Good evening.
- Hello.

334
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:45,023
- Supper?
- A bottle of wine.

335
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:48,609
You're exceptionally lucky.

336
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:52,403
You want to see
a beautiful old ritual?

337
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:54,655
Yes, very much.

338
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:57,699
- Tomorrow at dawn.
- What?

339
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:00,910
You can take part too.

340
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:03,995
Many thanks.

341
00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:06,122
- Juice?
- No, thanks.

342
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:09,292
What is the ritual called?

343
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,126
Abduction of the bride.

344
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:12,962
- Abduction?
- Not quite.

345
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:16,089
The bride wants to be abducted.

346
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,508
Her parents don't mind.
According to our custom

347
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,429
the bride should be stolen
before registration.

348
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,264
Stolen? It's a beautiful custom.

349
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:28,807
Where do I come in?

350
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:32,936
- Catch the bride.
- Catch...

351
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,980
- Shove her into the bag.
- The bag?

352
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:38,357
Is it the custom too?

353
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:40,399
Fantastic!

354
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:42,986
And give her to whom?

355
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:45,404
- The enamoured man.
- Nope.

356
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,490
Friends of the enamoured man.

357
00:34:49,908 --> 00:34:51,243
Oh, friends!

358
00:34:51,576 --> 00:34:53,661
- Such is the custom.
- I see.

359
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:56,080
Oh, here they are. Meet them.

360
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:57,831
My pleasure.

361
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,259
Please meet...

362
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:12,968
Shurik.

363
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:24,770
Sorry. Sit down please.

364
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:38,948
They don't speak any Russian

365
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:41,825
but they understand it.

366
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:48,581
What did he say?

367
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,461
He said good appetite.

368
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,714
- Go on, eat.
- Thanks a lot.

369
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:20,690
Smart.

370
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:27,946
What did he say?

371
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:30,198
He says if you refuse

372
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:33,784
they'll knife you.

373
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:38,871
- That's a joke.
- A joke...

374
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,873
A joke. Okay.

375
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,879
Good. Nina will be happy.

376
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:49,881
So the bride's name is Nina?

377
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:52,257
She's my niece.

378
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:58,220
So Nina has a boyfriend?

379
00:36:59,054 --> 00:37:00,598
They adore each other.

380
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,731
I quite forgot.

381
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,609
Tomorrow I've got...

382
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,277
I mean I'm sorry,

383
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,447
I can't do this.

384
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,326
Comrade Shurik,

385
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,536
the point is

386
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,997
Nina wants you

387
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,999
to do it.

388
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:36,085
Did Nina say that?

389
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,045
Yes.

390
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:46,635
Well, tell Nina

391
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:51,221
I'll do it. See you.

392
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:58,186
The custom prescribes
doing it naturally.

393
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,481
The bride will offer resistance,

394
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:04,733
she'll kick, bite, call the police,

395
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:07,319
cry "I'm going to complain
to authorities!"

396
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:11,364
You ignore her,
it's a fine custom.

397
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:13,991
I see.

398
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,036
Not to worry,
it will all be natural.

399
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:20,996
Later.

400
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,477
Shurik!

401
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:46,024
What are you doing?

402
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,234
Say nothing.

403
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:54,322
What's with you?

404
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:58,534
I've come to say goodbye.

405
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:01,078
Goodbye, Shurik.

406
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:03,579
Goodbye, Nina.

407
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:07,625
- Be happy.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

408
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:42,278
What is it?

409
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:50,118
The stolen bride.

410
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:56,122
You joker! Don't forget to invite me
when you make barbecue

411
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,541
out of this bride.

412
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,315
EAGLE NEST

413
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:47,747
So it wasn't a ritual?

414
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,750
- She was really stolen.
- Yes.

415
00:41:51,835 --> 00:41:53,794
Who stole her? Oh...

416
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:55,963
Who's the bridegroom?

417
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:59,840
This usually becomes known
at the wedding.

418
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:03,218
There'll be no wedding.

419
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:08,806
I stole her, I'll redeem her.

420
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:24,778
Comrade Shurik!

421
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:32,033
- What happened?
- A crime. Stealing!

422
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:34,870
What's stolen? Your donkey?

423
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:36,954
A girl. Nina.

424
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:38,831
I'm the only witness.

425
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,337
You are not a witness,
you are an abductor.

426
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:47,337
- A criminal!
- I didn't know!

427
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:51,425
It's a disgrace on a district scale,
I swear, honestly.

428
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:55,344
- I didn't know!
- I'll handle that.

429
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:58,138
Who's this mysterious man,
a paltry scoundrel?

430
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:01,099
Do you know him? No?

431
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:05,185
Too bad. He's an immoral character,

432
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:07,062
immoral.

433
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:09,398
Thanks for the tip-off.

434
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:11,816
This negative occurrence

435
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:14,235
will help us mobilize the public.

436
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,861
Right. I'm going to the police.

437
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:19,697
Police? They'll arrest you.

438
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,492
They'll have to.

439
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:28,913
Have you got money?

440
00:43:30,622 --> 00:43:33,376
Your salvation is in vanishing.
I'll do the rest.

441
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:36,669
Nina will be rescued
and those bastards tried.

442
00:43:37,004 --> 00:43:39,588
You'll appear in court
as a witness.

443
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:43,342
I have no right

444
00:43:43,758 --> 00:43:45,635
to abuse your goodwill.

445
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:47,846
You're taking chances

446
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,889
harboring a criminal.

447
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:52,849
I must atone for my guilt.

448
00:43:53,933 --> 00:43:56,477
Thank you, thank you very much.

449
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:01,606
Comrade Shurik,

450
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,109
why the police?
We don't want sacrifices.

451
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,945
Go to the prosecutor.
He'll understand.

452
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,031
Welcome, dear guests.

453
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:15,910
- Is the prosecutor here?
- Sure. The whole town's here.

454
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,246
We were waiting for you.
Wine for the dear guests!

455
00:44:19,872 --> 00:44:22,498
Thanks, I don't drink.
I'd like to see the prosecutor.

456
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,542
You can't refuse.
It's a mortal offense.

457
00:44:27,169 --> 00:44:30,463
- Please.
- This way, please.

458
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,638
Hospital?

459
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:43,557
Come quick.

460
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,435
Kapitanaki's house.

461
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,229
One of the guests is quite bad.

462
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,023
Please come now.

463
00:44:55,817 --> 00:44:58,070
Cut it. The man's singing.

464
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:03,157
What's happened? A runover?

465
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,200
The man's had a drop too much.

466
00:45:06,742 --> 00:45:09,620
It's a complex case.

467
00:45:12,665 --> 00:45:16,668
We must save him,
it's serious, I swear.

468
00:45:17,377 --> 00:45:21,004
Owing to alcoholism
he has a fixed idea.

469
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,215
He's bursting to rescue
a stolen bride.

470
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:28,719
A clouded mind, honestly.

471
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:31,805
Yeah. Delirium tremens.

472
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:35,183
- D.T.
- He's very bad indeed.

473
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:38,560
He'll be as good as new
in three days.

474
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:41,020
There's no hurry.

475
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:44,314
What's important is
to cure our guest.

476
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:46,983
And return a sound man to society.

477
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:49,861
- No hurry at all.
- We'll do what we can.

478
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,915
If I was a sultan,
I would have three wives

479
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,502
And I'd be surrounded
By triple beauty, guys.

480
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:46,380
But upon second thought
Given such affairs

481
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,508
I would have - Allah knows!-
Only trouble an' cares.

482
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:54,302
On one hand it's so good
To have three young wives

483
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,348
But on the other
It's not so, guys.

484
00:49:11,317 --> 00:49:12,652
It's okay,

485
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,405
you can come.

486
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:48,930
What should we, sultans, do
Faced with this setup?

487
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:52,933
Should we have - gee! - three wives
Or make do with one?

488
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:56,937
There's no need to think long,
The answer's well known.

489
00:49:57,687 --> 00:50:01,482
If I was a sultan,
I would live alone.

490
00:50:39,763 --> 00:50:41,431
Open up!

491
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:50,731
So that's what it is?

492
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:54,401
I'm going on a hunger strike.

493
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:00,405
No one but the prosecutor
enters here.

494
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,782
Take care!

495
00:51:09,162 --> 00:51:10,539
MENTAL HOSPITAL

496
00:51:11,998 --> 00:51:14,041
Typical delirium tremens.

497
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:17,169
He's bursting to rescue
a stolen girl,

498
00:51:18,086 --> 00:51:21,047
comrade Saakhov says.

499
00:51:21,422 --> 00:51:23,423
Yeah. He called me.

500
00:51:23,757 --> 00:51:27,260
He's now in a state
of catatonic agitation.

501
00:51:27,677 --> 00:51:30,930
- He demands to see you.
- I'll see him, if he demands.

502
00:51:39,437 --> 00:51:40,771
Careful.

503
00:52:27,852 --> 00:52:31,813
Comrade Saakhov's diagnosis
has been confirmed.

504
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:33,731
Saakhov?

505
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:37,360
- Did you say Saakhov?
- I did.

506
00:52:40,153 --> 00:52:42,447
He incarcerated me here.

507
00:52:42,863 --> 00:52:45,616
He sent you here
when you were in crisis.

508
00:52:46,033 --> 00:52:48,576
- Acute crisis.
- Acute crisis.

509
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:00,628
I'll tell you what.

510
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:05,089
Saakhov stole this girl.

511
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,343
Sure. Stole and buried her.

512
00:53:08,676 --> 00:53:11,178
- And wrote an epitaphy.
- Listen. Saakhov is...

513
00:53:11,512 --> 00:53:13,763
Relax, we'll set you on your feet.

514
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:16,141
Alcoholics are in our line.

515
00:53:19,476 --> 00:53:21,144
Untie me!

516
00:53:25,857 --> 00:53:28,191
Will you behave?

517
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:30,569
Untie him.

518
00:53:33,738 --> 00:53:36,866
I see you don't believe me.

519
00:53:39,702 --> 00:53:41,452
Can I see the prosecutor?

520
00:53:42,328 --> 00:53:44,539
You can.
Where's the prosecutor here?

521
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,209
Ward 6. Napoleon was there before.

522
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:53,630
Don't eat, don't drink,

523
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:55,631
don't speak if you like,

524
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,466
it won't help you.

525
00:53:59,342 --> 00:54:03,430
The worthiest man in the district
offers you his hand and heart.

526
00:54:05,513 --> 00:54:07,223
- A dinner set.
- What?

527
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:11,185
- It's a dinner set now.
- A big set?

528
00:54:11,936 --> 00:54:15,105
For 12 persons, 96 pieces.

529
00:54:16,564 --> 00:54:18,483
You've no conscience.

530
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:21,694
You spit on our customs.

531
00:54:22,278 --> 00:54:23,612
What?

532
00:54:24,487 --> 00:54:27,407
It's silly. You've no choice.

533
00:54:29,492 --> 00:54:32,078
You mean they'll miss you?

534
00:54:32,411 --> 00:54:35,663
They'll turn to your family.
And your family is me.

535
00:54:36,665 --> 00:54:39,541
I'll say you quit college,
got married

536
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:41,210
and left.

537
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:46,381
Let me tell you...
Don't interrupt me!

538
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:48,883
So...

539
00:54:49,258 --> 00:54:51,885
Either you agree to marry
comrade Saa--

540
00:54:52,844 --> 00:54:56,181
Or you stay here for good.

541
00:55:07,439 --> 00:55:09,024
There's a good girl.

542
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:12,443
Open the door.

543
00:55:14,028 --> 00:55:16,780
You'll meet your dear fiance.

544
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,085
- Take off my hat.
- What?

545
00:55:33,419 --> 00:55:35,212
Take off my hat.

546
00:56:05,861 --> 00:56:07,822
I'm disappointed I swear.

547
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,283
I didn't do anything, okay?
Just walked in.

548
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:14,953
- She's too young and fickle.
- Fickle? She's a hooligan!

549
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:20,206
Get this straight.

550
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,876
There are two ways
I can leave this house.

551
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,796
Either I take her
to the registry office

552
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:30,632
or she takes me
to the prosecutor's office.

553
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:33,217
- No.
- Of course not.

554
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,735
Don't worry.

555
00:56:55,403 --> 00:56:56,903
She'll get hungry in a day,

556
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,321
depressed in a week

557
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:01,907
and wise in a month. Let's wait.

558
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:07,662
Remember, comrades:
you've got to justify

559
00:57:08,037 --> 00:57:10,789
the great trust placed in you.

560
00:57:11,957 --> 00:57:13,876
You answer with your lives for her.

561
00:57:14,251 --> 00:57:16,336
We'll do our best,
dear comrade Jabrail.

562
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,863
- How 'bout a drop or two?
- It's a sin to mock at patients.

563
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:53,074
- I can run for it.
- You can't run away from here.

564
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:55,409
I know how.

565
00:58:11,297 --> 00:58:12,673
MENTAL HOSPITAL

566
00:58:17,677 --> 00:58:19,137
Hey, psycho!

567
00:58:26,518 --> 00:58:28,435
Where are you running like mad?

568
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,981
- Where's your donkey?
- Hi.

569
00:58:33,148 --> 00:58:35,442
- Where are you going?
- That way.

570
00:58:35,901 --> 00:58:37,443
Jump in, I'll give you a lift.

571
00:58:45,534 --> 00:58:46,868
Where to?

572
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:49,662
I'll tell you my story
and you decide where.

573
00:58:50,038 --> 00:58:52,623
- Make haste.
- It's a terrific vehicle.

574
00:59:01,879 --> 00:59:05,299
Cursed be the day when I mounted
this hoover!

575
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,759
To quote the great wise--

576
00:59:10,971 --> 00:59:12,847
A new paragraph.

577
00:59:13,765 --> 00:59:15,099
Lunch.

578
00:59:15,766 --> 00:59:17,100
Underline it.

579
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:20,770
She refused to eat soup.

580
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:25,066
- Refused...
- Mutton soup in brackets.

581
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:28,652
Now...

582
00:59:29,986 --> 00:59:31,570
Three plates of shashlik.

583
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:37,033
She threw it out.

584
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:41,328
Now wine.

585
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,414
She broke

586
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,418
two bottles.

587
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,170
- Three.
- Write three.

588
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,631
Three bottles.

589
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:05,181
Go on.

590
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:08,517
Fruit.

591
01:00:12,605 --> 01:00:13,980
Oranges...

592
01:00:14,397 --> 01:00:15,982
EAGLE NEST

593
01:00:30,243 --> 01:00:33,079
- Comrade Saakhov's dacha?
- Yep.

594
01:00:33,537 --> 01:00:35,248
It's the epidemiological station.

595
01:00:43,337 --> 01:00:44,672
What is it?

596
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:50,176
What do you want?

597
01:00:51,052 --> 01:00:52,928
It's about a murrain epidemy.

598
01:00:53,304 --> 01:00:56,431
Mass vaccination.

599
01:00:57,473 --> 01:00:58,808
Sign here...

600
01:01:03,186 --> 01:01:04,980
It's mandatory.

601
01:01:05,356 --> 01:01:06,898
SOPORIFIC DRAUGHT

602
01:01:12,486 --> 01:01:15,113
- Do I take off the shirt?
- Not necessarily.

603
01:01:17,406 --> 01:01:18,950
Lie on your belly.

604
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:40,633
Relax. I'm not injecting yet.

605
01:01:41,051 --> 01:01:43,970
Oh... Is it painful?

606
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:46,805
It depends on the needle's diameter.

607
01:01:47,307 --> 01:01:48,890
What's your...

608
01:01:49,433 --> 01:01:50,809
Already?

609
01:02:02,235 --> 01:02:04,028
- Spirits?
- Spirits.

610
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:57,071
Don't fidget.

611
01:02:58,071 --> 01:03:01,616
It's the latest vaccine
of prolonged effect.

612
01:03:03,785 --> 01:03:05,995
- Anybody else in the house?
- Nobody.

613
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:07,955
Be quiet

614
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:11,499
or else - "memento mori".

615
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,085
- Momentarily...
- Into a mere.

616
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:16,795
- Get it?
- Yes.

617
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:19,423
Assistant, water!

618
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:22,217
I bet Nina is here.

619
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:25,011
Go find her.

620
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,472
When will they pass out?

621
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,265
In half an hour.

622
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:48,029
The filtering murrain virus

623
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:52,742
is especially virulent...

624
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:55,702
Cut it out, doc.

625
01:03:56,162 --> 01:03:58,871
Shut up... Please go on.

626
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,624
...in an organism

627
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:05,585
weakened by nicotine,

628
01:04:06,294 --> 01:04:08,546
alcohol and--

629
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:12,674
- Bad excesses.
- Right.

630
01:04:17,845 --> 01:04:20,098
Nina!

631
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:24,184
Where are you?

632
01:04:28,144 --> 01:04:30,314
Hush. In there.

633
01:12:18,278 --> 01:12:20,070
Nina,

634
01:12:20,779 --> 01:12:22,197
what's with you?

635
01:12:27,202 --> 01:12:28,536
Are you okay?

636
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:35,624
Thank God.

637
01:12:37,126 --> 01:12:39,336
- Why?
- Traitor, mean hireling.

638
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,880
- Hold it!
- Judas, bastard!

639
01:12:42,256 --> 01:12:43,923
- How much did they pay you?
- Wait!

640
01:12:44,256 --> 01:12:45,590
Untie me!

641
01:12:51,304 --> 01:12:54,057
Worthless, venal creature!

642
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:57,976
Let me be, gangster.

643
01:12:58,768 --> 01:13:01,854
Rotter, dolt, chameleon.

644
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:04,647
Scoundrel!

645
01:13:05,273 --> 01:13:08,234
Alkie! Despicable folklor--

646
01:13:44,306 --> 01:13:45,765
Hello.

647
01:13:47,349 --> 01:13:48,976
Come on, speak.

648
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:35,764
Who is there?

649
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,722
Hello.

650
01:15:50,658 --> 01:15:53,619
What a surprise!

651
01:15:56,163 --> 01:15:57,997
I must change, excuse me.

652
01:15:58,415 --> 01:16:02,001
They'll change you in the morgue.

653
01:16:16,554 --> 01:16:19,389
We are here to try you

654
01:16:21,058 --> 01:16:22,518
by the law of the mountains

655
01:16:23,143 --> 01:16:25,853
for disgracing our clan.

656
01:16:28,856 --> 01:16:31,191
You'll die like a mean jackal.

657
01:16:32,317 --> 01:16:33,859
You have no right.

658
01:16:34,235 --> 01:16:35,862
You'll answer for this.

659
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,864
I will answer for your lousy skin

660
01:16:39,281 --> 01:16:41,492
only to my conscience,

661
01:16:41,992 --> 01:16:43,910
my sister's honor

662
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,121
and my ancestors' memory.

663
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:47,996
Nina, stop them.

664
01:16:48,372 --> 01:16:51,416
We are modern guys.
It's medieval barbarity!

665
01:16:51,749 --> 01:16:55,002
I have broken the code of honor
and I admit my mistake.

666
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,761
Mistakes are not admitted,

667
01:17:07,178 --> 01:17:09,890
they must be atoned with... blood.

668
01:17:11,057 --> 01:17:12,808
You can't do this!

669
01:17:14,476 --> 01:17:16,145
You can't do this!

670
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,022
It's the mob law! I demand

671
01:17:19,398 --> 01:17:21,773
a trial by the civil law.

672
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:24,902
Did you buy her by the civil law?

673
01:17:25,276 --> 01:17:27,695
Did you steal her by the civil law?

674
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:30,822
Cut this fruitless debate.

675
01:17:31,365 --> 01:17:35,202
Sis, turn on the tellie
to full capacity.

676
01:17:37,412 --> 01:17:39,080
No.

677
01:17:39,663 --> 01:17:42,374
Please. I won't do it again.

678
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:45,293
I swear, I won't.

679
01:17:45,877 --> 01:17:48,588
Let me go to the prosecutor's.

680
01:17:49,213 --> 01:17:51,506
I'll hand myself in to authorities.

681
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:05,976
Hamlet. Good bird.

682
01:18:07,978 --> 01:18:09,520
Are you in your right minds?

683
01:18:10,021 --> 01:18:11,690
Easy, it's only salt.

684
01:18:13,107 --> 01:18:15,317
All rise. The court is in session.

685
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:23,616
Glory to our court, the most humane
court in the world!

686
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:31,331
All sit.

687
01:18:39,253 --> 01:18:41,755
- Sit down.
- Thanks, I'd rather stand.

688
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,050
Your honor,

689
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:48,094
he can't sit.

690
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:22,664
After the springtime downpour

691
01:19:23,331 --> 01:19:25,083
Bright dawn is sure to come.

692
01:19:25,416 --> 01:19:27,208
Lovers for many years

693
01:19:27,626 --> 01:19:29,461
Will admire

694
01:19:30,128 --> 01:19:31,962
The glowing skies.

695
01:19:32,338 --> 01:19:34,131
Rivulets will be purling,

696
01:19:34,841 --> 01:19:36,550
Mist will be coyly swirling,

697
01:19:36,925 --> 01:19:38,677
White as a Polar bear.
