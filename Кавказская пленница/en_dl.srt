1
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:39,967
This story was told to us by Shurik. He was collecting folklore during his vacation:

2
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:45,517
Maybe this story is just a legend...

3
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:51,023
But according to Shurik it really happened in one of the mountain regions.

4
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:57,572
He didn't say which one, so as not to be unfair to other areas,

5
00:01:57,906 --> 00:02:01,994
where exactly the same story could have happened...

6
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,549
Where are you going, well...

7
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,221
But... Geez...

8
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:57,229
The day I sat behind the wheel of that vacuum cleaner be damned!

9
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:58,731
Don't despair!

10
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:07,784
Not for nothing did the great and wise Abu-Ahmat-ibn-Bei, the first driver of

11
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,080
of this car: Take note, Edik... - Edik. - Sasha.

12
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:17,045
Take note, Edik, Allah only knows where the spark goes with this unworthy

13
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:21,592
in the glorious family of internal combustion engines.

14
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:26,056
May his carburettor suck off forever and ever!

15
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:04,426
- Excuse me, please. - Yes?

16
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:07,805
Excuse me, I have a big favor to ask of you.

17
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:13,270
- Please. - Can I ask you to go only on the highway, without turning around?

18
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:17,149
- Why is that? - My donkey follows you like a tethered donkey.

19
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,193
- Donkey? - Yes, it is.

20
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,281
- So he's the one chasing me? - Him, him!

21
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,744
- And I thought... - No, him!

22
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,167
- Are you from around here? - Yes, I'm visiting my aunt on vacation.

23
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,796
I'm on a business trip. How far is it to town?

24
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:36,090
- Two kilometers. - Thank you.

25
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:49,231
You see, not a step without you.

26
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:55,446
- Year of birth? - 42-Ð¹.

27
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,285
- Purpose of visit? - Ethnographic expedition.

28
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:04,082
- I see. Are you looking for oil? - Not exactly. I'm looking for folklore.

29
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,129
I'll be recording old tales, legends, toasts.

30
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:15,388
Toasts? Darling, you're in luck. I'll help you.

31
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,351
What's this?

32
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,686
- You need a toast. - Yes, I do.

33
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:25,734
And toast without wine is like a wedding night without a bride.

34
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:31,282
- No, I don't drink. - Do I drink? What's there to drink?

35
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:38,416
You misunderstand me. I don't drink at all. Do you understand?

36
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,299
- I don't have the physical ability. - So here's the first toast.

37
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:51,181
- A toast? I'll write it down... - You can write it down later. Grab a glass.

38
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:59,149
My great-grandfather said: I want to buy a house, but I can't...

39
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:05,616
I have the ability to buy a goat, but I don't have the will.

40
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:13,167
So let's drink to our wishes being equal to our possibilities.

41
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:39,115
- Good for you. - Okay. - Listen to the other toast. - Okay, uh...

42
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:47,584
- I'll be right there. - That's okay, I'll just get some air.

43
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:52,673
I'm going to get some air. It's always study, study, study...

44
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:09,694
- Where have you been? - What's up?

45
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:14,617
- My niece. - Nice to meet you. - Nina.

46
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:17,621
- She's a student. She's a student at the Pedagogical Institute.

47
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,877
- She's going to be grooming our replacement, isn't she? - Ace student, Komsomol member, athlete.

48
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,589
- An athlete? - My uncle knows all about me.

49
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,799
An "A" student and a "Komsomol" student is exactly what we need, right?

50
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,718
What do you need?

51
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:34,097
- I have an unexpected question for you. - Please.

52
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:39,981
- How do you feel about getting married? - Well, it's positive, actually.

53
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:41,732
It's too soon for her to be thinking about it.

54
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:45,321
It's never too early to think about it and it's never too late, is it?

55
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:50,869
How do you feel about our opening celebration of the Wedding Palace?

56
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:53,581
- I'll definitely be there. - You will, won't you? - I will.

57
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:58,002
I'll have a small but important errand for you. - What kind of errand?

58
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:02,091
- Well, we'll see, yes. We'll be expecting you. - Well, all right.

59
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:16,276
So when the whole flock flew south for the winter,

60
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,035
one little birdie said: "Personally, I'm going to fly right into the sun."

61
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:34,882
It began to fly higher and higher, but very soon burned its wings

62
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:39,971
and fell to the bottom of the ravine.

63
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:48,606
So let's drink to the fact that none of us, no matter how high he flies,

64
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:54,906
would never be separated from the collective.

65
00:09:56,616 --> 00:10:02,707
- What, what happened, dear? - It's a pity about the bird!

66
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:08,964
And the princess hanged herself with anger on her own scythe, because he

67
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:13,637
counted exactly how many grains in the sack, how many drops in the sea,

68
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,517
and how many stars in the sky. So let's drink to cybernetics!

69
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:27,947
Cheers!

70
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,495
Cheers!

71
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,732
Dear friends, today is a joyful,

72
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:01,153
bright, sunny holiday.

73
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:10,957
In a few seconds, these silver scissors will cut this silk ribbon...

74
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:17,172
...and open up a straight path for all the newlyweds in our neighborhood...

75
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:20,343
to a bright future, you know,

76
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:23,221
to happiness, love and harmony, you know,

77
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:27,102
through our Wedding Palace.

78
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:38,407
The honor of opening the Palace

79
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:50,380
is given to a beautiful woman, a girl who...

80
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:57,222
who embodies the new destiny of a woman of the mountains, you know.

81
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:03,563
She is a student, a Komsomol member, an athlete,

82
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:06,983
finally, she's just a beauty!

83
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:17,287
So this is that small but responsible assignment. Please.

84
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:41,985
As our wonderful satirist Arkady Raikin says,

85
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:44,446
a woman is a man's friend.

86
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:51,955
Just a moment... Please slow down, I'm writing it down.

87
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:56,211
- Who's that? - Probably the press. - Ah, the press.

88
00:12:57,461 --> 00:13:00,173
As our wonderful satirist Arkady Raikin says,

89
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:02,885
a woman is a man's friend.

90
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:08,642
Grandiose! Here's to the woman...

91
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,109
Give me the horn, give me the horn, I'm telling you, it's my horn.

92
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,869
...and disrupted the inauguration of the Wedding Palace.

93
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:31,337
Then on the ruins of the chapel... - Excuse me, did I ruin the chapel too?

94
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,466
No, that was before your time, in the 14th century.

95
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:43,852
It's all true, of course. It's all true. The paper is written correctly. It's all right.

96
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:50,735
So that's one side of it, right? But there's another side of the coin.

97
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,659
The intruder is not an intruder, but a major scholar,

98
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,415
a man of intellectual labor. Came to visit us, didn't he?

99
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:08,216
To collect our fairy tales, legends, you know, toasts...

100
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,427
- Toasts? - Toasts, yes.

101
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:15,766
And you don't know what you're doing, do you?

102
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,231
We're dealing with an industrial accident here.

103
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:26,779
I have a wonderful toast!

104
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:35,081
You, Comrade Shurik, have the wrong idea about our places.

105
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:42,382
Everyone knows that Kuzbass is an all-Union smithy,

106
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:49,099
Kuban is the breadbasket, and the Caucasus is the all-Union - what? - Health Resort!

107
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:57,317
No! The Caucasus is the All-Union smithy, health resort and breadbasket.

108
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:02,489
Where have you been? Last night I remembered a wonderful toast for you.

109
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:06,202
- Let's go quickly. - No, wait, my dear.

110
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:09,540
We'll talk to Shurik, while you write down your toast in triplicate

111
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:14,254
and present it in writing later. - You got it!

112
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,763
My dream is to record some ancient ritual, and to participate in it,

113
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:23,932
well that would be absolutely splendid.

114
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:31,524
You won't find those grandfatherly customs and rituals in our area anymore.

115
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:39,326
Maybe somewhere high up in the mountains you'll find something for science.

116
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:44,165
- Let's go to the mountains. - Well, that's right. That's your job.

117
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:51,049
You came to record fairy tales, and we work to make fairy tales come true!

118
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,598
I brought a toast.

119
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,814
- Bad, huh? - Well... What do you think you're doing?

120
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:06,859
You asked for three copies...

121
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:06,057
To live, as they say, is good!

122
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:11,898
- And living well is even better! - Exactly!

123
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:20,617
Shame on you. You're hurting the orphan.

124
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:23,120
She has no one but her aunt and uncle. 25!

125
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:30,379
- That's not true. I think highly of your niece, but there are limits. 18!

126
00:17:31,046 --> 00:17:37,345
Have some conscience! You're not getting a goat after all, you're getting a wife, and what a wife:

127
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:42,602
A student, a Komsomol member, an athlete, a beauty! And for all that I'm asking

128
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,065
25 sheep, it's ridiculous to bargain.

129
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,235
You're talking apolitically, honestly.

130
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:54,199
You don't understand the political situation. You see life from the window of my car.

131
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,123
Twenty-five rams! When our district...

132
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:02,668
didn't fully pay off the state's wool.

133
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:06,464
And you don't confuse your personal wool with the state wool!

134
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:16,227
I, comrade Jabrail, am here to guard the state's interests.

135
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,564
Sit down for now.

136
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,913
- Here's the deal: 20 rams... - 25!

137
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:36,292
- 20. Rosen lion refrigerator... - What?

138
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:42,467
Finnish, good, a certificate of merit... - And a free trip... - To Siberia!

139
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:53,605
- Well, all right. - Well, all right.

140
00:18:59,195 --> 00:19:05,620
So here's the deal. The groom agrees, so do the relatives, but the bride...

141
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:12,295
We don't bring up our young people very well. Very bad.

142
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:16,508
It's amazing how they don't take marriage seriously.

143
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:21,556
And who even asks the bride? A sack on her head, and foo!

144
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:28,523
Yes, that's right. That's a very good decision.

145
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:32,987
Only I personally won't have anything to do with it.

146
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:38,119
Don't worry. It'll be done by complete strangers.

147
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:43,000
- Yes. And not from our neighborhood. - Of course they are.

148
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:51,217
It's not a lezginka, it's a twist. I'll show you from the beginning.

149
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:56,766
With the toe of your right foot you squeeze the butt, like this.

150
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:03,441
The second butt you squeeze with the toe of your left foot.

151
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,989
And now you squeeze both butts together.

152
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:42,478
Fish...

153
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:24,238
- You sold it? - That's my business.

154
00:22:24,781 --> 00:22:28,825
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. It'll pass, it'll pass. Right, yeah, that's it, let's go!

155
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:36,835
Sheep to the stall. The refrigerator to the house.

156
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:43,344
Where are you going?

157
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,769
Go home.

158
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,941
You'll never make it. Stealing a girl like that.

159
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:56,360
An athlete, a Komsomol member.

160
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:03,911
By the way, in the next district, a groom stole a party member.

161
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:32,070
Well, Sasha, you are making amazing progress. - Oh, it's nothing. - Nonsense?

162
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:39,037
- It's nothing, insurance. - Well, I'll give you a more difficult task.

163
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,207
Okay, what is it?

164
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:47,006
- Pack a sleeping bag. - Yes, sir. - As fast as you can.

165
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:53,972
- Hold on. It's time. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Ready, set, go!

166
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,825
Done!

167
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:16,666
Will you sleep standing up? Time.

168
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:19,796
Look out!

169
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:27,889
Hold on, Shurik. I'm going to pull you up.

170
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:16,312
There are two of them...

171
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,443
- And this one with a tail. - The one with the tail doesn't count.

172
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:27,409
- The other one doesn't count. - A witness. - How about...

173
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:30,664
- No casualties. - Yeah, we should wait.

174
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:33,375
That's right, we'll wait. Give it up.

175
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:52,523
- What is this? Is it folklore, too? - No, it's our student song.

176
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:57,237
- It's a song about bears. - Yeah? But it won't work for you. - Why not?

177
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,784
- It's student folklore. Come on, come on. - Yeah?

178
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,871
All right, listen.

179
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:15,551
Somewhere in the world, where there's always a frost.

180
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:20,057
The bears rub their backs against the earth's axis.

181
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,605
"The centuries go by, and the seas sleep beneath the ice,

182
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:29,611
The bears rubbing their backs on the axis, The earth is spinning.

183
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:38,204
...the earth is spinning faster.

184
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:51,930
They're trying to spin the earth's axis,

185
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,601
So that the lovers will have to meet sooner.

186
00:27:56,936 --> 00:28:00,982
âª So that one morning a year or two earlier âª

187
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:05,905
Somebody's got to say what's important.

188
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:28,474
Following the springtime downpour Early the dawn will come

189
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:33,355
And for two happy ones Many, many years to come.

190
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:37,443
The lightning will flash and the streams will ring

191
00:28:37,776 --> 00:28:42,324
The fog will be white as a bear

192
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:05,102
Somewhere in the world, where there is always frost.

193
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:10,192
The bears rub their backs against the earth's axis.

194
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:14,155
Centuries are passing, The seas are sleeping under the ice,

195
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:18,786
The bears rubbing their backs on the axis, The earth is spinning.

196
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:28,214
...the earth is spinning faster.

197
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:09,556
Well, good-bye, Shurik. You go ahead, I'll go to the base.

198
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,272
- Well, Nina, goodbye. - Goodbye.

199
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,425
- Wait, Nina. - What, Shurik? - Let me walk you out.

200
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:03,789
You have not lived up to the high trust placed in you.

201
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:08,711
- It is impossible to work. - You give unrealistic plans.

202
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:13,592
What's that? Voluntarism!

203
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:23,020
- In my house, no language! - What did I say?

204
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:35,285
Oh so? Here's your advance... ...we refuse. Take it!

205
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:42,378
- Well, take it, take it. - Wait a minute.

206
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:59,231
Well, that's all right. Whoever gets in our way is going to help us.

207
00:32:07,449 --> 00:32:11,413
- Oh, that's another thing. - We'll go for that. - Well, get yourselves together.

208
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:33,148
- Come here! - Come here, you jerk!

209
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:04,853
Whose shoe? It's mine, thank you.

210
00:33:08,983 --> 00:33:10,944
Let's go!

211
00:33:17,077 --> 00:33:21,039
Go on. It's late.

212
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:25,170
Won't you get lost?

213
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:32,304
Well, go on.

214
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:44,485
- Comrade Shurik? - Dinner? - No. Alyosha, a bottle of wine.

215
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:49,074
- You're exceptionally lucky. - In what way?

216
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:52,704
You wanted to see an ancient, beautiful custom.

217
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:54,247
Of course, I dream of it.

218
00:33:54,956 --> 00:33:57,417
- Tomorrow at dawn. - What are you talking about?

219
00:33:58,043 --> 00:34:01,172
You can not only watch, you can participate.

220
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:05,678
- Thank you very much for that. Would you like some juice? - No.

221
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:11,852
- What's this rite called? - Bride kidnapping. - Kidnapping?

222
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,982
- No, don't think, the bride herself dreams of being kidnapped.

223
00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:24,075
You can go to the registry office, but before that, the bride must be stolen! - Steal?

224
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,664
Oh, man, that's a beautiful custom. Well, what's my role?

225
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:37,425
- Catch the bride. Put her in a sack. - In a sack? Is that a custom, too?

226
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:40,678
Genius!

227
00:34:41,304 --> 00:34:44,641
- And hand her over to whom? - A dzhigit in love. - No.

228
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:51,107
- And give it to the cousins of the dzhigit in love. - Oh, to the cousins?

229
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:53,902
- That is the custom. - I see.

230
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:57,281
- By the way, here they are. I'll introduce them. - It would be my pleasure.

231
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:12,343
- Meet. - Shurik.

232
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:41,044
They don't speak Russian at all. But everyone understands.

233
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:53,894
- What does he say? - He says, "Bon appetit.

234
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:26,683
Bambarbia. Kergudu.

235
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:28,644
What did he say?

236
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:33,608
He says if you refuse, they'll slaughter you.

237
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,532
It's a joke.

238
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:43,870
- A joke... I agree. - That's fine.

239
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,917
Nina will be very happy.

240
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:52,382
- So the bride's name is Nina? - Nina. My niece.

241
00:36:55,385 --> 00:37:00,975
- Does Nina have a fiancÃ©? - They adore each other.

242
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:13,240
I completely forgot.

243
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:21,208
I'm sorry, I can't do this. You can't.

244
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:33,348
Most importantly, Nina asked you to be the one to do it.

245
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:38,271
- Nina asked you to do it? - Very much.

246
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:50,035
Well, tell Nina I agree.

247
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:58,504
But be warned, custom demands that everything be natural.

248
00:37:58,504 --> 00:37:59,922
Nobody knows anything.

249
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,926
The bride will resist, kick,

250
00:38:02,926 --> 00:38:05,219
...even bite, call the police..,

251
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:07,473
shouting, "I'm going to complain to the Obkom!"

252
00:38:07,473 --> 00:38:09,392
but don't pay any attention.

253
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:18,569
I understand. Don't worry. Everything will be natural.

254
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,711
Shurik...

255
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,677
What are you doing, Shurik?

256
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:49,681
Don't say anything.

257
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:55,271
What's the matter with you, huh?

258
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,276
I came to say goodbye to you.

259
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:06,242
- Goodbye, Shurik. - Goodbye, Nina. Be happy.

260
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:10,164
Goodbye, goodbye.

261
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:42,913
What are you loading?

262
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:51,131
The bride was stolen, Comrade Sergeant Major.

263
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:58,515
Joker! When you roast a kebab with this bride, don't forget to invite her.

264
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,995
- So it wasn't a ritual? She really was stolen. - Yes.

265
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:55,626
- Who stole it? Ah, yes... Who's the groom?

266
00:41:56,711 --> 00:42:03,636
- We sometimes find out at weddings. - There will be no wedding!

267
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:10,018
I stole it, I'll give it back!

268
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:25,538
Comrade Shurik!

269
00:42:29,376 --> 00:42:33,589
- What's the matter? What happened? - A crime, stolen! - What was stolen?

270
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:36,718
Your donkey was stolen? - The girl, Nina. - Nina?

271
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,555
- I'm the only witness.

272
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:45,187
No, you're not a witness, you're a kidnapper, a criminal!

273
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,481
Well, I didn't know!

274
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:52,112
What a shame, I swear, on my word of honor, to the whole neighborhood!

275
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,658
- I didn't know! - I'll look into it personally.

276
00:42:55,992 --> 00:43:00,581
This mysterious fiancÃ© is a lowlife scoundrel! You don't know who it is?

277
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,088
- That's too bad. A scoundrel, a scoundrel, an immoral type, just an immoral type!

278
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:11,470
Thank you very much for the signal. With this single negative example,

279
00:43:11,803 --> 00:43:14,556
we will mobilize the public, raise the masses... - That's right!

280
00:43:15,265 --> 00:43:19,312
- And I'll go to the police. - What militia, listen? They'll arrest you.

281
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,275
They're formally obliged to put you in jail - they will.

282
00:43:30,116 --> 00:43:34,623
- The only way out is to disappear. I'll do everything myself. Nina will be saved.

283
00:43:35,082 --> 00:43:37,042
We'll put these scoundrels on trial by show trial.

284
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:41,214
And you will come to the trial as a witness indeed.

285
00:43:43,216 --> 00:43:46,805
- I have no right to abuse your nobility. - What nobility?

286
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:53,269
You're risking your life because of me. Nina was stolen by me, and I must redeem myself.

287
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:08,706
Why go to the police? You don't need those victims. Go straight to the prosecutor. He'll understand everything.

288
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:14,421
- Dear guests, welcome. - Tell me, Marim, do you have the prosecutor?

289
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:19,886
We've got everything, the whole town is here, just waiting for you. Wine for our dear guests!

290
00:44:20,387 --> 00:44:26,269
- No, I don't drink. We'd like a prosecutor. - We can't refuse. Blood grudge.

291
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:45,835
A regional hospital? Come immediately to 47 Gogol Street. Kapitanaka house.

292
00:44:47,962 --> 00:44:52,633
Yes, where the name day is. One of the guests is very bad. Please come at once.

293
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:14,453
You understand that this is a very severe form of the disease. We have to save the man.

294
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:23,171
Alcoholism makes him obsessive-compulsive. A stolen bride.

295
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:26,217
He's always trying to save someone,

296
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:28,929
It's just a mental breakdown, I swear.

297
00:45:30,222 --> 00:45:33,059
Right. Delirium tremens. White hot.

298
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:35,937
Yeah, he's white, he's hot, he's very white.

299
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:43,446
We'll have him back on his feet in three days. No, there's no rush. He's our guest.

300
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:48,327
The important thing is to cure him. It's important to bring him back to society as a whole person.

301
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:51,331
We'll do our best.

302
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:39,870
If I were a sultan I would have three wives

303
00:48:40,204 --> 00:48:46,587
And I would be surrounded by three beauties. But on the other hand, in such matters,

304
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:51,676
So many troubles and cares, Ah, save Allah.

305
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:58,142
It's not bad to have three wives, But it's very bad on the other side.

306
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:16,833
It's okay, you can come.

307
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:49,998
How should we sultans be, Clarity is needed here.

308
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:54,002
How many wives is good enough: Three or one?

309
00:49:54,711 --> 00:49:57,883
There's a simple answer to that question:

310
00:49:57,883 --> 00:50:01,094
If I were a sultan, I'd be single.

311
00:50:03,056 --> 00:50:09,980
It's not bad at all without a wife, It's much better on any side.

312
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:55,619
Oh so! All right, then. I'm going on a hunger strike!

313
00:50:56,788 --> 00:51:01,710
And now no one but the prosecutor is coming in here!

314
00:51:03,546 --> 00:51:05,256
Look out!

315
00:51:12,723 --> 00:51:17,187
Typical delirium tremens. Rushing to save some stolen girl,

316
00:51:19,148 --> 00:51:21,428
Anyway, he's behaving just like comrade Saahov warned us.

317
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:24,229
Yes, yes, he called me too.

318
00:51:24,487 --> 00:51:29,493
Now he's in a state of excitement and demands that you take him in.

319
00:51:30,036 --> 00:51:32,457
If he demands it, we'll take him in.

320
00:51:40,382 --> 00:51:43,011
Be careful.

321
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,530
Comrade Sahakhov's diagnosis is clearly confirmed.

322
00:52:33,864 --> 00:52:39,371
- Did you say Saahov? - Saahov, Saahov.

323
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,417
So he's the one who put me in here?

324
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:46,295
He didn't put me away, he sent me here in a moment of crisis.

325
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:50,009
- An acute crisis.

326
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:05,820
I'll tell you this: Sahov stole this girl.

327
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:10,367
That's right, he stole her. He buried her in the ground and wrote an inscription.

328
00:53:12,454 --> 00:53:17,000
Go, go. We'll cure you. Alcoholics are our specialty.

329
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:24,050
Untie me.

330
00:53:26,762 --> 00:53:31,059
- Will you behave yourself? - Untie me.

331
00:53:34,438 --> 00:53:37,943
I understand. You all don't believe me.

332
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:45,284
Can I see the prosecutor? - You may. Where is the prosecutor?

333
00:53:46,077 --> 00:53:50,290
In Room 6, where Napoleon used to be.

334
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:56,215
You don't have to eat, you don't have to drink, you don't have to say anything,

335
00:53:56,548 --> 00:53:59,010
it still won't help you.

336
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:04,517
The best groom in the neighborhood offers his hand and heart.

337
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:11,943
- The service. - What? The service. - The big set?

338
00:54:12,527 --> 00:54:18,200
- Twelve, 96 pieces. - You have no conscience.

339
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:23,916
You ignore our customs. What?

340
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:29,256
It's stupid. It's not like you have any other choice.

341
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:32,759
You mean they'll come looking for you?

342
00:54:33,885 --> 00:54:36,932
They'll go to a relative, and I'm the relative.

343
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:42,522
I'll say she dropped out of college, got married and moved away.

344
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:48,237
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to you!

345
00:54:50,364 --> 00:54:57,123
So: or you'll come out of there wife - ah, what a groom! Or don't come out at all.

346
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:17,732
That's another thing. Open the door, you're about to meet the groom.

347
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:35,629
- Take off your hat. - What? Take off your hat.

348
00:56:05,206 --> 00:56:11,339
Look, it hurts, I swear it hurts, I didn't do anything, I just walked in.

349
00:56:12,756 --> 00:56:15,969
- She's young, she's capricious. - What a naughty girl, look, a bully!

350
00:56:21,183 --> 00:56:24,896
Now I have only two ways out of this house:

351
00:56:25,814 --> 00:56:31,154
Either I take her to the registry office, or she takes me to the prosecutor.

352
00:56:31,947 --> 00:56:33,699
- Don't do it. - I don't want to.

353
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:59,272
That's all right. In a day she will be hungry, in a week she will be pining,

354
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:03,444
and in a month she'll be smart. That's all right, we'll wait. - We'll wait.

355
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:11,328
Remember, comrades. You finally have to live up to the trust placed in you.

356
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:16,919
And you're responsible for her with your head. We'll do our best, comrade Jabrail.

357
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:50,876
- Can we think of three? - It's a sin to make fun of sick people.

358
00:57:51,211 --> 00:57:53,880
Seriously, I'll run away, huh?

359
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,551
- You can't escape from here. - There is one way.

360
00:58:18,034 --> 00:58:20,454
Stop, you lunatic!

361
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:30,633
Why are you running like a madman? Where's your donkey?

362
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:37,893
- What happened? What's your hurry? - That way, that way. - Get in, I'll give you a lift.

363
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:48,572
- Where are you going? - I'll tell you everything,

364
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,658
and you decide where to take me.

365
00:58:50,992 --> 00:58:54,787
Just hurry up. - Car's a beast. Listen.

366
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:06,552
Damn the day I sat behind the wheel of that vacuum cleaner!

367
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:14,562
Start a new line.

368
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:17,649
Lunch, underline, no soup.

369
00:59:24,157 --> 00:59:28,286
In brackets, kharcho soup. - Kharcho...

370
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:37,757
Three portions of kebab - threw into the abyss. - Into the abyss.

371
00:59:43,222 --> 00:59:48,144
Broke two bottles of wine.

372
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:55,320
- Three. - Write three. - Three bottles...

373
01:00:06,918 --> 01:00:10,630
The fruit is oranges.

374
01:00:31,573 --> 01:00:35,828
- Comrade Saahov's dacha? - Yeah. - Sanitary and epidemiological station.

375
01:00:50,094 --> 01:00:51,013
- Who do you want?

376
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:58,856
There's an epidemic in the area. Vaccination drives. Foot and mouth disease! Sign here!

377
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:17,295
- Shirt off? - You don't have to take your shirt off.

378
01:01:18,464 --> 01:01:20,632
Lie down on your stomach.

379
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:45,621
- Relax. I haven't shot it yet. - Ah. Not yet. Tell me, does it hurt?

380
01:01:45,997 --> 01:01:49,501
- It depends on the diameter of the needle. - Tell me, do you have a diameter...

381
01:02:02,976 --> 01:02:07,523
- Alcohol? - Alcohol.

382
01:02:56,541 --> 01:03:02,382
Lie down without moving. This is the latest delayed-absorption vaccine.

383
01:03:05,135 --> 01:03:07,805
- Is there no one else in the house? - No, there's no one else in the house.

384
01:03:08,138 --> 01:03:12,185
Stay still, stay still. Otherwise, "memento sea".

385
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:17,442
- Instantly... - To the sea!

386
01:03:21,406 --> 01:03:26,160
Nina is here, I'm sure. Find her and warn her.

387
01:03:26,495 --> 01:03:31,292
- And when will they be asleep? - In half an hour. Go, go.

388
01:03:46,854 --> 01:03:53,694
The filtered FMD virus develops particularly vigorously in the body...

389
01:03:54,696 --> 01:03:59,785
- In short, Sklichasovsky! - You're not interested, don't interfere.

390
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:04,666
It develops especially vigorously in the body,

391
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:07,712
weakened by nicotine, alcohol and...

392
01:04:09,797 --> 01:04:14,219
- ...bad things.

393
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:26,193
Nina, Nina, where are you?

394
01:04:28,904 --> 01:04:32,492
Quiet. Go that way.

395
01:12:20,605 --> 01:12:24,777
Nina, Nina... What's wrong with you?

396
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:30,034
Nina, are you all right?

397
01:12:35,373 --> 01:12:38,753
Oh, thank God! Thank God! - What for?

398
01:12:39,795 --> 01:12:44,761
Traitor, sneaky mercenary... Judas! Scoundrel! How much did they pay you?

399
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,513
Untie me!

400
01:12:53,187 --> 01:12:55,815
Worthless, venal scum.

401
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:02,031
Let me go! You bandit, you trash, you stupid..,

402
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:09,623
chameleon, scoundrel! Alcoholic, miserable folklorist!

403
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:49,047
Hello, I'm listening. Speak up, come on!

404
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:35,437
Who's there?

405
01:15:27,834 --> 01:15:29,836
Hello...

406
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,867
I didn't expect to see you here. It's such a surprise for me.

407
01:15:57,328 --> 01:16:03,836
Excuse me, I'll change. - Don't worry about it. They'll change you in the morgue.

408
01:16:18,103 --> 01:16:24,069
We have come to judge you by the law of the mountains.

409
01:16:24,444 --> 01:16:32,288
For wanting to disgrace our clan, you will die like a vile jackal.

410
01:16:34,165 --> 01:16:36,709
You have no right! You will answer for this!

411
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,717
I'll answer for your filthy hide only to my conscience as a jigit...

412
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,723
...my sister's honor and the memory of my ancestors.

413
01:16:48,349 --> 01:16:50,644
Nina, stop them. You and I are modern people.

414
01:16:51,061 --> 01:16:53,688
This is medieval savagery. Well, I've broken that code,

415
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:57,276
but I'm willing to admit my mistakes.

416
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:11,168
Mistakes shouldn't be admitted, they should be washed away in blood.

417
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,714
You have no right!

418
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:23,307
This is vigilante justice! I demand to be judged according to our Soviet laws.

419
01:17:23,642 --> 01:17:26,688
Did you buy it under Soviet laws?

420
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:29,774
Or under Soviet laws did you steal it?

421
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:35,030
Let's stop this useless discussion. Sister, turn the TV up.

422
01:17:39,537 --> 01:17:44,168
Don't, I'm begging you, don't. I won't do it anymore! I swear to you,

423
01:17:44,668 --> 01:17:50,091
I won't do it anymore. Well, let me go to the prosecutor's office.

424
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:54,722
Well, let me turn myself in to the authorities.

425
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:08,071
Ah, Hamlet, well done, listen.

426
01:18:09,574 --> 01:18:12,535
- Are you out of your mind? - Don't worry, it's only salt.

427
01:18:15,664 --> 01:18:18,417
Stand up! The court is coming!

428
01:18:21,213 --> 01:18:25,593
Long live our court, the most humane court in the world!

429
01:18:30,641 --> 01:18:32,602
Please be seated.

430
01:18:40,528 --> 01:18:43,490
- Be seated. - Thank you, I'll stand.

431
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:49,038
Citizen judge, he can't sit down.

432
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:25,749
After the springtime downpour the dawn will come early.

433
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:30,797
And for two happy ones Many, many years to come.

434
01:19:31,424 --> 01:19:35,094
The lightning will flash and the streams will ring,

435
01:19:35,678 --> 01:19:39,975
The fog will be white as a bear.
