1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,259
Can you trust Kurzgesagt videos?

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,379
To answer this question,
we'll first explain how we research them

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,379
and then talk a bit about past videos,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,289
and what we want to achieve with the channel.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,229
Making a Kurzgesagt video
always begins with a question or an issue.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,309
For example, after our meat video,

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,679
many viewers asked about the health effects of meat on humans.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,169
We had no idea, and were pretty curious too,

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,529
so we just decided to work on it.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,849
The first step is research.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,599
We start by looking for books
and scientific papers to get an overview,

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,469
and just read a lot.

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,199
The plan is to find a story worth telling.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,299
Is there something surprising to learn?

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,019
Is there a larger context or a new perspective,

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,199
or will it be an overview or introduction?

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,209
Once we have the first readable version,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,279
we reach out to experts or scientists,

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,819
and ask them to fact check and correct us.

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,469
Often enough, they find a flaw

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,569
or point us in the direction of contradictory research.

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,379
At this point, many scripts die.

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,939
If our idea does hold up, we continue working on it.

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,029
This process can take weeks or months.

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,349
Our Loneliness script, for example,
took over a year and a half to finish.

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,649
The hardest part is being brief,
while not simplifying too much.

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,479
It's much easier to
write a long script than a short one.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,709
When we're finally done,

29
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,939
we do another round of research
and show the script to experts again,

30
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,499
ideally different ones than the ones we talked to

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,629
at the beginning of the process.

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,619
When we express an opinion, we mark it as such.

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,469
That's not saying that we don't
draw conclusions from the research.

34
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,859
Homeopathy does not work,
and meat is really bad for the planet.

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,559
Climate change is real, but organic food
is not a good way of solving it.

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,239
If the facts clearly support a conclusion,
it's OK to present it as such.

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,269
Of course, we can't always make everybody happy.

38
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,129
People who know a lot about a topic sometimes get annoyed

39
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,619
if we don't mention an aspect they think is crucial,

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,199
or when we omit technical terms.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,479
This is, more or less, unsolvable
because of the nature of our videos.

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,049
Scripts have around 1,300 words,

43
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,369
so there's always some degree of simplification.

44
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,969
You will always find a list of our research and sources

45
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,839
and further reading material in the video description.

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,039
Just citing sources doesn't make your work
accurate or your research good though,

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,859
so we encourage you to use our sources document as a starting point

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,689
to look at the topic yourself and learn more.

49
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,789
But, it would be dishonest to say 
that we've always worked this way.

50
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,529
Some older videos don't live up
to the standards we set ourselves today.

51
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,969
The two that annoy us the most
are the Refugee and Addiction videos.

52
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,339
In both of them, we didn't try to present a balanced perspective,

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,019
but instead chose a take and ran with it.

54
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,339
The Refugee video was made with a deep feeling
of angry frustration about the world

55
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,809
at the high point of the 2015 refugee crisis.

56
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,609
While we argued over quotas,
dead children washed ashore on our coastlines.

57
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,029
The script was written on one Sunday afternoon,

58
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,999
and illustrated and animated within a week.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,479
It was exhausting, stressful, and frustrating.

60
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,819
We still believe it was the right thing
for European countries to help,

61
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,669
but it was absolutely unnecessary
to be toxic about it.

62
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,089
We insulted people, and brushed away their concerns
about real and profound challenges.

63
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,409
The video was divisive and emotional,

64
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,029
at a time when the debate needed a calm and clear overview.

65
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,919
The addiction video was based on only one source

66
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,739
that has amassed a lot of criticism over the years.

67
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,769
And, unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists,

68
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,329
or do extra research, on the papers
that were the basis for the video's thesis.

69
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,659
That, addiction is purely psychological and based
on the life circumstances of the individual.

70
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,899
This stance is still held by a number of addiction professionals,

71
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,579
and we're not saying it's wrong,

72
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,129
but a lot of others disagree,

73
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,819
and it's not correct to present it as -the- truth.

74
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,849
Addiction is far from solved
and our videos should have reflected that,

75
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,999
instead of taking one side.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,249
We simplified an idea so much,

77
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,839
that it made a great story, but became distorting.

78
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,299
Both videos were made over the span of two months,

79
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,059
and they're two of our most successful videos to date.

80
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,479
We had found a formula that really worked.

81
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,518
But we never made anything like them again,

82
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,838
and have been discussing how to deal
with them for a long time.

83
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,709
It doesn't help that both videos are loved by many people.

84
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,739
We want to be proud of our work,

85
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,519
and these two videos don't make us proud.

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,819
So, today, we deleted them.

87
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,779
It won't purge them from the Internet,

88
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,259
but that's not the goal anyway.

89
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,479
Feel free to upload them elsewhere.

90
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,439
We're working on a new addiction video

91
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,529
that we'll take a look
at the chemical and psychological causes.

92
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,759
We'll take our sweet time with it,
so please have patience.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,559
The refugee video is not up-to-date anymore,
so we will not renew it.

94
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,679
We're also going through our older videos to add sources,

95
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,099
further reading, and comments in the next few months.

96
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,119
Nowadays, rather than trusting in mainstream institutions,

97
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,779
we often look at creators on the Internet
for reliable information.

98
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,439
We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous,

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,889
and not led by monetary incentives.

100
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,619
And we expect them to acknowledge mistakes
in public, and work to minimize them.

101
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,549
So, this is what we're going to do:

102
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,129
Trust is not a thing you earn once and then keep forever.

103
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,409
You have to constantly work for it.

104
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,919
So can you trust Kurzgesagt?

105
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,619
You can trust that every video we make
is thoroughly researched and approved by different experts.

106
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,939
You can trust that we know that we have biases,
and we try to overcome them.

107
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,269
We want to move Kurzgesagt further
towards the trustworthy end of the spectrum.

108
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,989
The world is too complex for simple answers,
and we don't want to be the ones giving them.

109
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,759
Making these videos over the last six years
has been quite a ride, and we're very grateful for it.

110
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,039
We hope you'll be with us for the next few years, too.

111
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,819
And join us on our journey to figure out
what this universe and life stuff is all about.

112
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,180
Thank you for watching.
