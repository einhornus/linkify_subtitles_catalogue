1
00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:02,960
It's hard to get to space

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,531
As much as we all wish there were an easy,

3
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:08,260
and affordable way to see our planet
floating in the dark

4
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:13,087
Right now, the only way is to become
an astronaut or a billionare

5
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:16,017
But there is a concept
that might make it possible

6
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:19,330
-while serving as the starting point
for the exploration of the universe-

7
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:21,071
The space elevator

8
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:31,693
How exactly does it work?

9
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:35,819
To understand how a space elevator
will get us into space

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,490
We must first understand
what an orbit is

11
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:42,288
Being in orbit basically means
falling towards something,

12
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,154
but moving fast enough to miss

13
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:48,171
If you throw a ball on earth
it makes an arch through the air,

14
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:49,438
and then hits the ground

15
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,203
In space, gravity makes you move
much the same way,

16
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:55,194
but if you move sideways fast enough

17
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:58,317
the curvature of the earth makes the ground
fall away beneath you

18
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,438
as fast as gravity pulls you towards it

19
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,499
So, to enter Earth's orbit
rockets have to go up

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,296
and sideways fast

21
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:11,799
By contrast, a space elevator
taps into energy from Earth's rotation

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,243
to get the cargo going fast

23
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:18,340
Imagine a child spinning a toy on a rope
with an ant on the child's hand

24
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:20,753
As the ant climbs out along the rope

25
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:23,674
it starts to move faster and faster
as it ascends

26
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:27,766
Compared to rockets,
with cargo launched on an elevator

27
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:30,186
you only need to provide
the energy to go up

28
00:01:30,187 --> 00:01:33,789
Fast sideways movement comes free
with the Earth's rotation

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,487
But the space elevator would without a doubt

30
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:40,414
be the single largest and most expensive
structure ever built by humans

31
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:42,925
So, is it worth it?

32
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:45,661
It all comes down to costs

33
00:01:45,662 --> 00:01:48,209
Rockets burn a huge amount of rocket fuel

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,300
just to get a small
amount of cargo into space

35
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:55,907
At current prices, it costs about $20,000
to put one kilogram of payload into space

36
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,895
that's $1.3 million dollars
for the average human

37
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:01,089
$40 million dollars for your car

38
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,851
billions for 
an international space station

39
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:08,327
This immense cost is one of the major
limitations of human spaceflight

40
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,192
Even with advancing technology,

41
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:14,667
this cost isn't likely to be comparable with the
price of an airline ticket anytime soon

42
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,557
A space elevator would solve this problem

43
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:18,917
After construction,

44
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:24,611
a space elevator is projected to reduce the cost 
one hundredfold to $200 per kilogram

45
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:28,444
If an inexpensive space elevator
costs 20 billion dollars,

46
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:32,535
then we'll recoup our losses
after launching only one million tons

47
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:35,854
Close to the weight
of two international space stations

48
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,484
So what would a space elevator look like
in real life?

49
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:42,257
A space elevator has four major components:

50
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:46,115
the tether, anchor, counterweight
and climber

51
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:49,917
The elevator part of the space elevator
is the tether and the climber

52
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:52,559
It extends from the surface of the Earth to space

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,580
The climber is like a conventional
elevator carriage

54
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,798
A chamber that works its way
up and down the tether

55
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,559
At the base would be an anchor

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
pinning the tether to the Earth
along with a port for climbers

57
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,040
At the top is the counterweight
which holds up the tether

58
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,390
The tether is held tight like a rope

59
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:12,193
and supported from above
by the tension from the counterweight

60
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:16,303
Located higher than 36,000 kilometers
above the Earth's surface

61
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:18,757
At the counterweight
could be a space station,

62
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:22,527
a launching point for all missions
from the spaceport elevator

63
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:24,906
But can we actually build one?

64
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,745
It's hard to say

65
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:28,475
The biggest challenge is the tether

66
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,795
It needs to be light, affordable

67
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:33,792
and more stable than any material
we can produce right now

68
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:37,814
There are promising materials
like graphene and diamond nanothreads,

69
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:40,003
but even they may not be strong enough

70
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:42,480
And aside from being incredibly strong,

71
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:46,343
the tether would also have to withstand
atmospheric corrosion, radiation

72
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:49,563
and micrometeorite and debris impacts

73
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,485
Additionally, it takes several days
to climb the elevator

74
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:54,972
How do we power the climber?

75
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:57,546
It requires a lot of energy to go up

76
00:03:57,547 --> 00:04:01,051
Do we need a nuclear reactor
on our elevator carriage?

77
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:05,043
Or do we beam it power from the ground
with a super powered laser?

78
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:09,072
And where do we get the raw materials
for a 36,000-kilometer-long tether?

79
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:11,581
Do we make it on Earth
and launch it into space?

80
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:14,610
Or do we make it in space
and lower it down to the Earth?

81
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:17,110
Could asteroid mining be the answer?

82
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,696
Put simply, there are still some major
technological hurdles to overcome

83
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:25,166
And a space elevator is not without risk

84
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:28,867
Should the tether break,
it would collapse in spectacular style

85
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,505
If it breaks near the anchor

86
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:33,980
the force exerted by the counterweight
will cause the entire elevator to rise up

87
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,592
ascending into space

88
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:37,674
Should it break near the counterweight

89
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,037
the tether will fall,

90
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:41,192
wrapping around the world
and whipping the end off

91
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:45,637
The resulting debris in orbit could pose
serious problems to future spaceflight

92
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:50,206
If we build a space elevator on Earth,
we have to do it right the first time

93
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,231
For these reasons some experts
have proposed first building

94
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,129
a space elevator on the Moon

95
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,732
The Moon's gravity
is much weaker than the Earth's

96
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:00,762
so a flimsier but existing material
like kevlar

97
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:02,362
could serve as a tether

98
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:04,346
Even with all these challenges,

99
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,299
the payoff of having a working
space elevator would be immense

100
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,958
It might be the first step to truly becoming
a space-faring civilization

101
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,669
Maybe we will never build
a space elevator,

102
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,334
but in trying to do so
we might learn an awful lot

103
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:21,170
And when it comes
to the exploration of the universe,

104
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:24,008
there can't be too many dreams
of a glorious future
