1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,999
The fundamental currency of our universe is energy.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,759
It lights our homes, grows our food,
powers our computers.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,439
We can get it lots of ways:

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,839
Burning fossil fuels, splitting atoms,

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,559
or sunlight striking photovoltaics.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,799
But there's a downside to everything

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,059
Fossil fuels are extremely toxic,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,019
Nuclear waste is... well, nuclear waste,

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,599
And, there are not enough batteries to store sunlight for cloudy days yet.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,399
And yet the sun seems to have virtually limitless free energy.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,299
Is there a way we could build a sun on Earth?

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,659
Can we bottle a star?

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,999
[Intro Jingle]

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,919
The sun shines because of nuclear fusion.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,239
In a nutshell, fusion is a thermonuclear process.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,839
Meaning that the ingredients have to be incredibly hot.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,639
So hot, that the atoms are stripped of their electrons

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,839
Making a plasma where nuclei and electrons bounce around freely.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,439
Since nuclei are all positively charged,

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,019
They repel each other.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,939
In order to overcome this repulsion,

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,899
The particles have to be going very, very fast

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,599
In this context, very fast means "very hot"

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,819
Millions of degrees

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,339
Stars cheat to reach these temperatures.

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,079
They are so massive, that the pressure in their cores

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,759
Generates the heat to squeeze the nuclei together

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,599
Until they merge and fuse

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,199
Creating heavier nuclei and releasing energy in the process.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,699
It is this energy release that scientists hope to harness

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,899
In a new generation of power plant,

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,859
The fusion reactor.

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,839
On earth it's not feasible to use this brute force method to create fusion.

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,579
So if we wanted to build a reactor that generates energy from fusion,

35
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,579
We have to get clever.

36
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,899
To date, scientists have invented two ways of making plasmas hot enough to fuse:

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,699
The first type of reactor uses a magnetic field to

38
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,839
Squeeze a plasma in a doughnut shaped chamber

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,359
Where the reactions take place.

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,839
These magnetic confinement reactors

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,419
Such as the I.T.E.R. reactor in France,

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,659
Use superconducting electromagnets cooled with liquid helium

43
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,459
To within a few degrees of absolute zero.

44
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,059
Meaning that they host some of the biggest temperature gradients in the known universe.

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,699
The second type called "Inertial confinement"

46
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,899
Uses pulses from super-powered lasers

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,059
To heat the surface of a pellet of fuel

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,399
Imploding it, briefly making the fuel hot and dense enough to fuse.

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,419
In fact, one of the of the most powerful lasers in the world

50
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,499
Is used for fusion experiments

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,659
At the National Ignition Facility in the U.S.

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,319
These experiments and others like them around the world

53
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,799
are today, just experiments.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,639
Scientists are still developing the technology,

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,559
And although they can achieve fusion,

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,919
Right now, it costs more energy to do the experiment

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,219
Then they produce in fusion.

58
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,239
The technology has a long way to go before it's commercially viable,

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,319
and maybe it never will be.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,179
It might just be impossible to make a viable fusion reactor on earth,

61
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,099
But if it gets there, it will be so efficient

62
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,359
That a single glass of sea water, could be used to produce

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,359
as much energy as burning a barrel of oil, with no waste to speak of.

64
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,199
This is because fusion reactors
would use hydrogen or helium as fuel

65
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,159
And sea water is loaded with hydrogen

66
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,459
But not just any hydrogen will do.

67
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,099
Specific isotopes with extra neutrons called Deuterium and Tritium

68
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,379
Are needed to make the right reactions.

69
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,639
Deuterium is stable and can be found in abundance in sea water,

70
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,999
Though Tritium is a bit trickier.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,319
It's radioactive

72
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,399
And there may only be 20 kilograms of it in the world

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,259
Mostly in nuclear warheads

74
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,579
Which makes it incredibly expensive.

75
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,319
So we made need another fusion buddy for Deuterium instead of Tritium.

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,599
Helium-3, an isotope of Helium,
might be a great substitute.

77
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,439
Unfortunately, it's also incredibly rare on earth.

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,459
But here, the moon might have the answer.

79
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,639
Over billions of years, the solar wind may have built up huge deposits

80
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,059
Of Helium-3 on the moon.

81
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,078
Instead of making Helium-3, we can mine it.

82
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,299
If we could sift the lunar dust for helium,

83
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,579
We'd have enough fuel to power the entire world for thousands of years.

84
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,699
One more argument for establishing a moon base, if you weren't convinced already.

85
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,699
Ok, maybe you think building a mini sun

86
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,399
Still sound kind of dangerous

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,499
But they'd actually be much safer
than most other types of powerplants

88
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,119
A fusion reactor is not like a nuclear plant,

89
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,499
Which can melt down catastrophically.

90
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,099
If the confinement failed, then the plasma would expand and cool,

91
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,439
And the reaction would stop.

92
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,259
Put simply, it's not a bomb.

93
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,859
The release of radioactive fuel, like Tritium,

94
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,019
Could pose a threat to the environment.

95
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,339
Tritium could bond with oxygen making radioactive water,

96
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,959
Which could be dangerous as it seeps into the environment.

97
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,459
Fortunately, there's no more than a few grams in use at a given time,

98
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,379
So a leak would be quickly diluted.

99
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,719
So we've just told you that theres nearly unlimited energy to be had

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,719
At no expense to the environment

101
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,719
In something as simple as water.

102
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,239
So, whats the catch?

103
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,259
Cost. We simply don't know if fusion power will ever be commercially viable.

104
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,239
Even if they work, they might be too expensive to ever build.

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,459
The main drawback, is that it's unproven technology

106
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,459
Its a 10 billion dollar gamble

107
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,839
And that money might be better
spent on other clean energy

108
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,339
That's already proven itself.

109
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,499
Maybe we should cut out losses

110
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,519
Or maybe, when the payoff is unlimited
clean energy for everyone,

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,859
It might be worth the risk.

112
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,059
Videos like this one take hundreds of hours to make
