00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,199
Today we're doing something different.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,879
Our friend John Green will read a story from his podcast, "The Anthropocene Reviewed".

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,319
We hope you enjoy it and we'll be back with a regular video,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,879
Soon.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,938
So if you've ever been or had a child, you will likely already be familiar with hand stencils.

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,729
They were the first figurative art made by both our kids somewhere between the ages of 2 and 3.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,328
My children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece of paper, and then with the help of a parent,

8
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,939
traced their five fingers.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,409
I remember my son's face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,148
shocked to see the shape of his hand still on the paper - a semi permanent record of himself.

11
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,899
I am extremely happy that my children are no longer 3

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:00,538
and yet to look at their little hands from those early artworks is to be inundated with a strange,

13
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,999
soul splitting joy.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,429
Those pictures remind me that they are not just growing up, but also growing away from me, running toward their own lives.

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,399
But of course that's meaning I am applying to their hand stencils and that complicated

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,119
relationship between art and its viewers is never more fraught than when we are looking deeply into the past.

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,839
In September of 1940, an 18 year old mechanic named Marcel Ravidat

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,939
was walking his dog Robot in the countryside of southwestern France, when the dog disappeared down a hole.

19
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,869
Robot eventually returned, but the next day Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole and

20
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:49,889
after quite a bit of digging they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over

21
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:57,929
900 paintings of animals: horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a woolly rhinoceros.

22
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,459
The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with

23
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,299
red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube,

24
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,119
possibly a hollowed bone, unto the walls of the cave.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,959
It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,359
Two of the boys who visited the cave that day were so profoundly moved by the art they saw,

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,979
that they camped outside the cave to protect it for over a year.

28
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:38,679
After World War II the French government took over protection of the site and the cave was open to the public in 1948.

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,979
When Picasso saw the cave paintings on a visit that year he reportedly said,

30
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,119
''We have invented nothing.''

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,389
There are many mysteries at Lascaux. Why, for instance, are there no paintings of reindeer,

32
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,829
which we know were the primary source of food for the Paleolithic humans who lived in that cave?

33
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,479
Why were they so much more focused on painting animals than painting human forms?

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,299
Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images, including pictures on the ceiling that required the building of scaffolding to create,

35
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,119
while other areas have only a few paintings?

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,019
And were the paintings spiritual -- "here are our sacred animals"?

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,619
Or were they practical -- "Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you"?

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,889
Aside from the animals, there are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes

39
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:32,009
we cannot interpret, and also several "negative hand stencils" as they are known by art historians.

40
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,738
These are the paintings that most interest me.

41
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,969
They were created by pressing one hand with fingers splayed against the wall of the cave and then blowing pigment,

42
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,259
leaving the area around the hand painted.

43
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,639
Similar hand stencils have been found in caves around the world, from Indonesia to Spain to

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,659
Australia to the Americas to Africa.

45
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:02,719
We have found these memories of hands from 15 or 30 or even 40 thousand years ago.

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,279
These hand stencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past.

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,609
Amputations likely from frostbite are common in Europe.

48
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:17,239
And so you often see negative hand stencils with three or four fingers. And life was short and difficult.

49
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:24,859
As many as a quarter of women died in childbirth; around 50% of children died before the age of five.

50
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,579
But they also remind us that the humans of the past were as human as we are.

51
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,429
Their hands indistinguishable from ours.

52
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,258
These communities hunted and gathered and there were no large caloric surpluses.

53
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:46,698
So every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water, and yet somehow

54
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:50,149
they still made time to create art.

55
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,228
Almost as if art isn't optional for humans.

56
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,499
We see all kinds of hands stenciled on cave walls,

57
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,999
children and adults, but almost always the fingers are spread.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,008
Like my kids' hand stencils.

59
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,288
I'm no Jungian.

60
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:10,399
But it's fascinating and a little strange that so many Paleolithic humans,

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,119
who couldn't possibly have had any contact with each other,

62
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,319
created the same paintings the same way --

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,429
paintings that we are still making.

64
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:27,379
But then again, what the Lascaux art means to me is likely very different from what it meant to the people who made it.

65
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,698
Some academics theorized that the hand stencils were part of hunting rituals.

66
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:38,149
Then there's always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model situated at the end of the wrist.

67
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,319
To me, though,

68
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:47,239
the hand stencils at Lascaux say, "I was here." They say, "You are not new."

69
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:55,159
And because they are negative prints surrounded by red pigment, they also looked to me like something out of a horror movie.

70
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,429
Like ghostly hands reaching up from some bloody background.

71
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,189
They remind me that, as Alice Walker wrote, "All history is current."

72
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,029
The Lascaux cave has been closed to the public for many years now.

73
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:17,249
Too many contemporary humans breathing inside of it led to the growth of mold and lichens, which has damaged some of the art.

74
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,119
Just the act of looking at something can ruin it, I guess.

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,439
But tourists can still visit an imitation cave called Lascaux II, in which the artwork has been

76
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,629
meticulously recreated.

77
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,499
Humans making fake cave art to save real cave art may feel like peak Anthropocene behavior.

78
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,479
But I have to confess that even though I am a jaded and cynical

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,939
semi-professional reviewer of human activity,

80
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,549
I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful, that four teenagers and a dog named Robot

81
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,949
discovered a cave with 17,000-year-old handprints, that the cave was so

82
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:01,529
overwhelmingly beautiful that two of those teenagers devoted themselves to its protection.

83
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:08,189
And that when we humans became a danger to that caves' beauty, we agreed to stop going.

84
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,849
Lascaux is there. You cannot visit.

85
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:18,869
You can go to the fake cave we've built, and see nearly identical hand stencils. But you will know

86
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,389
this is not the thing itself,

87
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,579
but a shadow of it.

88
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,589
This is a handprint,

89
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,709
but not a hand.

90
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,609
This is a memory that you cannot return to.

91
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:42,219
All of which makes the cave very much like the past it represents.

92
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,399
We hope you enjoyed this video even if it was different.

93
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,899
Check out John Green's podcast, "The Anthropocene Reviewed", where he poetically reviews the human world we live in.

94
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,099
John is a good friend of Kurzgesagt.

95
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,259
In fact without his channel, Crash Course, that he and his brother Hank started years ago,

96
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,259
Kurzgesagt would not exist, because it was the original inspiration for what we do today.

97
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,959
And over the years, John and Hank have helped us in a multitude of ways, from advice to just being friends.

98
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,150
So check out "The Anthropocene Reviewed" or any of their many channels.
