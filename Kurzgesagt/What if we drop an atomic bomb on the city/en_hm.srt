1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,499
Playing around with nuclear weapons in videos is fun.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,899
There's a visceral joy in blowing things up,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,639
and a horrifying fascination with things
like fireballs, shockwaves, and radiation.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,679
And while it does help put our destructive
power in perspective,

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,479
it's not the best way of understanding 
the real impact of a nuclear explosion.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:27,099
This isn't about silly stacks of TNT, or about how bright an explosion is. Nuclear weapons are about you.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,639
So we've partnered with the Red Cross
and Red Crescent movement

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,039
to explore what would really happen if a nuclear weapon were detonated in a major city today.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,119
Not nuclear war, just one explosion.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:49,199
*Kurzgesagt Intro Music*

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,039
We begin our story in the middle of
downtown in a major city.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,599
People are going to work, studying for exams, are lost in their thoughts and daily lives.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,219
Right here a nuclear weapon is detonated
and time freezes.

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,439
The first phase of the explosion happens
within less than a second.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,579
In a millisecond, a ball of plasma hotter than the Sun appears and grows in a fireball to more than 2 kilometres across.

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,799
Within this ball, everyone is just gone.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,279
Think of water dripped on to a very hot pan.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,279
A sizzle, and then there's nothing.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,399
Most buildings, cars, trees, 
tacky sculptures and people...

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,419
... all evaporated.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,539
First, the flash: an intense tsunami of light washes over the city in an instant.

22
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,339
If you happen to have your head pointed in the direction of the explosion,

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,019
it renders you blind for a few hours.

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,559
The heat of this light produces a thermal pulse,

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,959
so energetic and hot that it just burns everything as far as 13 kilometres from the detonation site.

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,059
What this means is that everything in an area of 500 square kilometres that is able to burn, starts burning.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,559
Plastic, wood, fabric, hair, and skin.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,119
If you happen to be in reach of the thermal pulse, one moment, you're on your way to work,

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,279
the next moment, you're on fire.

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,339
Now the second phase begins.

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,379
It happens in a few seconds.

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,599
Most people will now first notice
that something is wrong,

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,559
but it's already too late for hundreds of thousands.

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,979
The flash is followed by the shockwave.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,599
The heat and radiation of the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super-compressed air around it

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,379
that's now expanding explosively.

37
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,159
Faster than the speed of sound,

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,039
creating winds stronger than hurricanes and tornadoes.

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,419
Human infrastructure is no match for its power.

40
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,559
Most major buildings within a kilometre of the fireball are just ground up down to their base.

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,719
Only steel reinforced concrete is able to
partially resist the pressure.

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,799
In the surrounding parks where retirees feed the ducks,

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,819
trees blackened and smoldering from the heat a second before snap like toothpicks.

44
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,859
If you're outside, you get tossed away 
like a grain of dust in a tornado.

45
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,659
The shockwave weakens as it travels outwards

46
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,579
but still, about 175 square kilometres of houses collapse like they're made of cards,

47
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,939
trapping tens of thousands of people 
who didn't have any time to react.

48
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,859
Gas stations explode and fire spread
throughout the rubble.

49
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,579
A mushroom cloud made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash

50
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,919
rises kilometres into the sky in the next few minutes and casts a dark shadow over the ruined city.

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,419
This violently pulls in fresh air surrounding the city,

52
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,279
destroying more buildings and providing
an abundance of oxygen.

53
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,799
It depends on the city what happens next.

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,579
If there's enough fuel, fires may turn into a firestorm that burns the rubble, everybody trapped in it

55
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,099
and people trying to flee the devastation.

56
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,719
Up to 21 kilometres from the explosion, people just like you rush to their windows to take pictures of the mushroom cloud,

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,399
unaware that the shockwave is still coming at them,

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,259
about to shatter their windows and create
a blizzard of sharp glass.

59
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,359
The third phase begins in the coming hours and days.

60
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,139
We're used to the idea that help will come,
no matter the disaster.

61
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,139
This time is different: a nuclear explosion is like every natural disaster at once.

62
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,099
There are hundreds of thousands or millions of people with serious injuries:

63
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,259
lacerations, broken bones, serious burns.

64
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:32,139
In the next few minutes and hours, thousands more will die because of these injuries.

65
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,919
Countless people are trapped in collapsed buildings like in earthquakes or blinded by the flash,

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,879
deaf from the blast wave and unable to flee through streets impassable with rubble and debris.

67
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,859
They're terrified, confused, and don't know what's happened to them or why.

68
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,759
Most likely, many hospitals have been leveled along with all the other buildings

69
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,599
and most medical professionals are either dead or injured,

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,719
along with everyone else.

71
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,059
The survivors lucky enough to have been in metro tunnels or standing in the right place to be unburned and unhurt

72
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,439
won't have truly escaped harm yet.

73
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,179
Depending on the type of weapon, where it explodes and even the weather,

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,379
an awful black rain can begin,

75
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,179
with radioactive ash and dust descending on the city, covering everything and everyone.

76
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,279
The invisible, malicious, silent horror of
radiation takes its turn.

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,959
Every breath carries poison to the lungs of the survivors.

78
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,559
Over the coming days, the people who receive the highest doses of radiation exposure will die.

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,999
There will be no help, not for hours or maybe even days.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,979
Civilisation doesn't operate when 
there is a total breakdown of infrastructure.

81
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,739
Roads are blocked, train tracks warped, runways cluttered with rubble.

82
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,569
No water, no electricity,

83
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,739
no communication, no stores to replenish supplies from.

84
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,779
Help from surrounding cities will have a hard time entering the disaster zone

85
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,159
and even if they can, the radioactive contamination will make it risky to get too close.

86
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,999
After a nuclear attack, you're on your own.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,159
So, bit by bit, people emerge from the rubble on foot,

88
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,579
contaminated with radioactive fallout, carrying what little they may have left.

89
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,479
They are slow, in pain, traumatized, and they all need food, water and medical treatment fast.

90
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,199
And the damage done by a nuclear weapon doesn't end when the fires burn out and the smoke clears.

91
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,539
The hospitals in the neighboring cities are under-equipped for a disaster of this scale

92
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,099
and overwhelmed with tens or hundreds of thousands of patients with serious injuries.

93
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,179
In the weeks, months and years to come,

94
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,679
many of those who survived will succumb to cancers like leukemia.

95
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,759
The reason no government wants you to think about all this is because there is no serious humanitarian response possible to a nuclear explosion.

96
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,679
There's no way to really help the immediate victims of a nuclear attack.

97
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,399
This is not a hurricane, wildfire or earthquake or nuclear accident.

98
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,379
It is all of these things at once, but worse.

99
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,699
No nation on earth is prepared to deal with it.

100
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,819
The world has changed in the past few years, with world leaders again

101
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,139
explicitly and publicly threatening each other with nuclear weapons.

102
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,919
Many experts think the danger of a nuclear strike is higher than it has been in decades.

103
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,339
Governments tell their citizens that it's good that we have nuclear weapons,

104
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,499
but it's bad when anyone else gets them.

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,999
That it's somehow necessary to threaten others with mass destruction to keep us safe.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,259
But does this make you feel safe?

107
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:39,799
It only takes a small group of people with power to go crazy or rogue, a small misstep or a simple misunderstanding

108
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,059
to unleash a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.

109
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,719
Exploding stuff in videos is fun.

110
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,539
Exploding things in real life, not so much.

111
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,859
There is a solution though!

112
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,499
Eliminating all nuclear weapons 
and vowing never to build them again.

113
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,379
In 2017, almost 2/3 of all the world's countries,

114
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,759
supported by hundreds of civil society organizations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement

115
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,339
agreed to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.

116
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,019
It's not about who has nuclear weapons and who doesn't. The weapons themselves are the problem.

117
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,139
They are deeply immoral and an existential threat to all of us.

118
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,319
No matter what country you come from, no matter what political side you find yourself on,

119
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,579
we need to demand that they disappear forever.

120
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,939
This will not happen without pressure.

121
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,798
If you want to be part of this pressure, there are things you personally can do too:
