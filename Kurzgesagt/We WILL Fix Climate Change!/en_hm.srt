1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,319
Our home is burning. Rapid climate 
change is destabilizing our world.  

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,719
It seems our emissions will not fall quickly 
enough to avoid runaway warming and we may  

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,799
soon hit tipping points that will lead to the 
collapse of ecosystems and our civilization.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,799
While scientists, activists and much 
of the younger generation urge action,  

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,719
it appears most politicians are not 
committed to do anything meaningful  

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,399
while the fossil fuel industry still works 
actively against change. It seems humanity  

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,719
can’t overcome its greed and obsession with short 
term profit and personal gain to save itself.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,319
And so for many the future looks grim and 
hopeless. Young people feel particularly  

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,039
anxious and depressed. Instead of looking 
ahead to a lifetime of opportunity they  

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,079
wonder if they will even have a future or 
if they should bring kids into this world.  

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,399
It’s an age of doom and hopelessness and 
giving up seems the only sensible thing to do.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:13,439
But that’s not true. You are not 
doomed. Humanity is not doomed.  

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,279
Despite the seriousness of the situation, for 
years positive trends have accumulated and there  

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,199
is finally some good news and a clear path towards 
our collective climate goals. Welcome to our Ted  

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,039
talk, please watch this video to the end – check 
out our detailed sources afterwards to learn more.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,439
Ok! Let’s start with the scariest things.

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,159
Canceling the Apocalypse

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,279
Some of the most widely shared stories about 
Climate Change are that it is an existential  

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,399
threat – the end of human civilization and 
maybe even our own extinction event. And  

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,039
that it is basically unavoidable now. 
But what does science actually say?

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,679
As of 2022 the global average temperature  

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,239
has risen 1.2 degrees celsius 
compared to preindustrial times.  

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,879
Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees was the 
most ambitious goal of the Paris agreement  

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,119
but we are not likely to meet it. Already with the 
warming we have today, hot places will get hotter,  

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,439
wet places wetter and the risk and strength of 
extreme weather events increase significantly.

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,039
Warming beyond 2 degrees makes all of these 
extremes more extreme, extreme weather events  

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,519
more common with more ecosystems under 
major pressure. Some will not survive.

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,919
At 3 degrees significant parts of earth, 
especially in developing countries,  

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,439
might become unable to feed their populations. 
Heat waves will become a major global issue.  

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,319
Large scale natural systems will break 
down. The scale and frequency of hurricanes,  

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,879
fires and droughts will further increase and cause 
trillions in damage. Poor regions and subsistence  

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,639
farmers will be hit the hardest. Hundreds of 
millions of people will need to leave their homes.

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,319
In the 4-8 degree range the apocalypse begins 
– the hothouse earth, where things change  

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,879
so quickly, that it may become unable 
to support our large human population  

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,079
and billions may perish, leaving 
the rest on a hostile alien planet.  

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,079
A decade ago, for lack of action and perspective, 
many scientists assumed a 4+ degree world was our  

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,519
future and a lot of public communication 
focused on exactly this future path.  

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,119
Luckily, it's much less likely that this 
version of the apocalypse will come to pass.

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,639
If current climate policies stagnate, we’re 
likely to end up with warming 3 °C by 2100.  

40
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:44,799
Which is scary and tragic and far from acceptable. 
But this is actually good news – how? In the last  

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,519
decade, we have seen enough progress that most 
scientists now think that we have likely avoided  

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,599
apocalyptic climate change. Although substantial 
risk still remains, we can pretty confidently say  

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,559
that humanity isn’t going anywhere. Civilization 
might have to change, but it will endure.

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,519
Which begs the question: What has changed over 
the last ten years and is this really good news?

45
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,759
## The Invisible Shift

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,199
You probably know this story: The 
last decade has been an immense  

47
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,838
failure for climate policies around the world.  

48
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,159
Instead of passing comprehensive, binding 
bills that would meaningfully reduce emissions  

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,799
we mostly did: nothing. A lost decade with one 
negative record after another. And this story  

50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,959
is true and it is one reason why so many people 
are giving up. But it is not the whole picture.

51
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,599
Despite the lack of climate policies and ongoing  

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,119
lobbying and misinformation campaigns 
from the fossil fuel industries,  

53
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,999
there was a lot of progress. Let us go back 
20 years to see why today is so different:

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,839
Between 2000 and 2010, greenhouse 
gas emissions had grown by 24%,  

55
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,119
three times as much as the increase in the 
previous decade. Subsidies for fossil fuels  

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,319
aimed at promoting economic growth, caused 
a colossal increase in their consumption.  

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,799
For emerging countries like China and 
India coal was the cheapest fuel for growth  

58
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,399
while rich countries showed little 
interest in changing their ways.

59
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,199
In 2010, many people expected these trends 
to continue. Instead of decreasing fossil  

60
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,839
fuel use its consumption would rise. The next 
decade turned out to be very different though.

61
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,959
First of all, coal burning in emerging countries 
like India has been slowed down or leveled off,  

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,079
like in China. And it has plummeted 
in rich countries like the UK and US.  

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,199
Since 2015 three-quarters of planned coal 
plants have been canceled and 44 countries  

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,239
have committed to stop building them. Ten years 
ago that would have seemed like wishful thinking,  

65
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,239
but today we can say with confidence: Coal 
is dying. It is just not competitive anymore.  

66
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,559
Because technologies we thought would remain 
expensive matured rapidly instead. Renewable  

67
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,279
electricity has shown explosive progress. In a 
mere decade wind energy got three times cheaper.  

68
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,119
Solar electricity is now ten times cheaper! 
Cheaper than coal or any other fossil-fuel burning  

69
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,439
power plant, despite the massive subsidies and 
global infrastructure propping up fossil fuels.

70
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,679
25 times more solar and nearly 5 times more wind 
electricity is produced today compared with ten  

71
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,359
years ago, which is of course not nearly enough. 
One of the biggest obstacles is the variability  

72
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,959
of their power output. Renewables need a lot of 
energy storage to be a reliable power source,  

73
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,319
like expensive batteries. Amazingly battery 
prices have decreased by 97% in the past 30 years,  

74
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,879
60% in the last decade alone – which will serve 
all kinds of green technology like electric cars.

75
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,039
You might say, well that’s great but 
didn’t Kurzgesagt’s last climate video  

76
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,759
say that while wind and solar are nice, we need 
nothing less than a fundamental transition of  

77
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,159
our global industrial system? Yes but luckily 
the shift goes beyond just the energy sector.  

78
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,679
Throughout the economy people are working on 
improving current technology to lower emissions.

79
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,919
We’re rapidly replacing old incandescent light 
bulbs with LEDs that are ten times more efficient.  

80
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,319
In 2020 about 7 out of 10 new 
cars in Norway were electric  

81
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,239
or hybrid – In 2021 it was already 
8 out of 10. And the list goes on,  

82
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,839
from electric heating and better insulation 
to ships traveling at half speed to save fuel.

83
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,759
Wherever you look you find scientists,  

84
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,399
engineers and entrepreneurs trying to 
solve some aspect of climate change.  

85
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,479
Enormous amounts of human ingenuity are 
being brought to bear on this problem  

86
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,639
with more and more people deciding to prioritize 
preventing rapid climate change. Solutions for  

87
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,479
low-carbon production of cement, electronics and 
steel, and innovations like artificial meat and  

88
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,679
carbon capture are in the works. The more of 
these technologies we deploy; the cheaper new  

89
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,359
and better technology gets. The cheaper they 
get, the more people use them. And so on.

90
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
We can see the impact already:  

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,999
The domestic CO2 output of rich countries 
is falling without a major recession.  

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,839
Since the year 2000, the EU as a whole shows a 
21% decrease, Italy 28%, the UK 35%, Denmark 43%.

93
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,359
But the best news may be that emissions are no 
longer necessarily coupled with economic growth.  

94
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,959
In the past this was an inconvenient truth 
– to get richer, you had to emit more. Which  

95
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,879
led to fierce arguments between developing 
and developed countries about the fairness  

96
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,359
of reducing emissions while their populations 
were still poor. But in the last decade we have  

97
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,319
seen that it IS possible to increase prosperity 
without increasing emissions. Emissions in the  

98
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:53,119
Czech Republic dropped 13% while their GDP grew 
by 27%! France reduced their CO2 emissions by 14%  

99
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:01,759
while increasing GDP by 15%! Romania saw 
an 8% decrease and 35% growth! And even the  

100
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,759
largest economy on earth - the USA - decreased 
emissions by 4% while growing their GDP by 26%!

101
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,319
Some of you may call this a numbers trick. That 
rich countries are just exporting emissions to  

102
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,119
poorer nations by moving the dirty parts of 
their economies like manufacturing. But even  

103
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,479
when we account for all of our imported goods, 
the numbers still look positive! It’s no longer  

104
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,999
a matter of having to choose between prosperity 
and the climate as it seemed to be a decade ago.

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,999
Developing countries will profit from 
that because as rich countries pay for  

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,279
the expensive development of green technologies, 
they can adopt them more cheaply. They can skip  

107
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,959
most of the high emission phase that 
today's rich countries went through.  

108
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,479
We are at the point where not 
decarbonizing is a bad business decision.

109
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,559
And we haven’t even really talked 
about solutions like carbon capture.  

110
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,679
In 2000 it didn't really exist. In 2022 that 
technology does exist and costs around $600 to  

111
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,199
remove one ton of CO2 from the atmosphere. As 
investment pours in and the technology matures  

112
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,319
and begins to scale, it is likely that these 
costs will plummet over the next few decades.

113
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,839
So everything's fine then? Well let us not get 
carried away here - all of these processes are  

114
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,039
great but not nearly fast enough. We are still 
doing way too little and technology will not  

115
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,159
magically solve everything. We need to use 
fewer resources and use them longer, design  

116
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,919
consumer goods that are repairable and durable 
and decrease our energy requirements. We need  

117
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,719
much better infrastructure, agriculture 
and cities. It will still be hard work,  

118
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,079
especially to get the right 
policies passed and enacted.

119
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,519
But for the first time ever,  

120
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,919
there are a few trendlines pointing 
solidly in the right direction.

121
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,039
And now imagine – If all of this was achieved 
without proper financial and political support  

122
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,439
and despite fossil fuel lobbying 
– just think what humanity can do  

123
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,839
when climate change finally gets the 
political attention and funding it needs.

124
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,799
So is it ok to feel hopeful again? The 
situation is still dire and serious,  

125
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,759
so what is the point of focusing 
on this side of the story?

126
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,159
The Trap of Hopelessness

127
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,359
Climate change can feel overwhelming and 
make your future seem bleak. The sadness  

128
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,199
and hopelessness that many people feel is real 
and very destructive because it causes apathy.

129
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,359
Apathy that is only serving the fossil 
fuel industry that is still delaying  

130
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,959
change however it can. In a sense 
they have weaponized hopelessness.  

131
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,839
We are now in phase 4 in the public 
debate about rapid climate change action:

132
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,199
Phase 1 was: Climate Change is not real.

133
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,679
Phase 2 was: Climate Change is 
real but not caused by humans.

134
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,559
Phase 3 was: Climate Change may be 
caused by humans but it’s not that bad.

135
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,679
Phase 4 is: Climate Change is no longer avoidable. 
We are doomed and it doesn’t matter what we do.

136
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,719
If we want the world to change, we first need 
to believe that change is possible. And we have  

137
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,159
an abundance of evidence that it is. Changes 
to our industrial system are gaining momentum,  

138
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,599
technology gets better and cheaper, climate change 
has become a key issue in most free elections.  

139
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,639
As more and more younger people 
move into influential positions,  

140
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,719
they prioritize climate change and work on 
new solutions. In 2022 most governments not  

141
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,439
only acknowledge it but set their own net zero 
goals – in democratic and autocratic countries.  

142
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,639
The results of years of fighting a steep 
uphill battle are now clearly visible. The  

143
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,119
pressure needs to keep increasing, to make sure 
that the promises made today are actually kept!

144
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,919
Climate doomerism is the equivalent of giving up 
even though you can still prevent not just the  

145
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,119
worst case but also mitigate most of the bad 
things, make changes in time to adapt better  

146
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,079
and prevent the poorest from suffering. That is 
why hopelessness and apathy are so dangerous.

147
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,839
If the last, in many ways wasted 
decade, has shown anything,  

148
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,399
then it’s that progress is being made and that 
dire scenarios are just predictions – not our  

149
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,919
sealed fate. As of 2022, based on current global 
policies, we will end up in a 3 degrees world.  

150
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,559
Now it is our job to yet again prove the 
predictions wrong – despite how serious and  

151
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,879
urgent things are. To turn that 3 degrees into a 
2 degrees and then see where we can go from there.

152
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,519
For that we need hope. And we hope we gave you 
that today, at least a little. That you feel  

153
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,719
that things are serious but also that you have 
a future. That you can have kids without dooming  

154
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,279
them or the world. That taking action today is 
worth it. And that despite powerful industries  

155
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,359
doing everything to delay it, society is changing. 
If you need a more concrete roadmap of what you  

156
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,959
can do personally – we are working on a follow 
up video to talk about that in greater detail.

157
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,719
Doomerism, inactivity and weaponized hopelessness  

158
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:10,559
are the only trump cards left for the powers 
that don’t want change. Don’t let them win.

159
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,319
We are still excited about the future. 
And we think one of the best things  

160
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,279
you can do to keep your optimism and 
curiosity up is to learn new things.  

161
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,759
If you don’t know where to start, our friends 
from Brilliant.org have got you covered.

162
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,479
Brilliant makes math and science accessible 
and fun with a hands-on approach.  

163
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,479
More than 60 interactive courses 
like „The joy of problem solving“ or  

164
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,519
„Scientific thinking“ give you the tools to crack 
problems in math, science and computer science  

165
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,119
that are all designed to get your intuition 
going and give you plenty of aha-experience.

166
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,319
Lessons will surprise you with 
storytelling, code-writing tasks and  

167
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,599
interactive challenges – basically using whatever 
keeps you interested and entertained. All the  

168
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,959
content is interactive: instead of just reading 
and listening to explanations, you drag and drop,  

169
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,439
manipulate shapes and diagrams, make 
selections and answer questions.  

170
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,399
This way you learn something almost without 
you noticing it. And tiny step by step you’ll  

171
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,039
build up your long-term understanding of 
science and get closer to your STEM goals.

172
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,959

things that seem impossible at  

177
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,840
first – Brilliant can help you 
acquire the skills to do that.
