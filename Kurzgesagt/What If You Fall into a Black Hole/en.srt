1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,779
Black holes are the most powerful and extreme
things in the universe and they are wildly

2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:20,150
weird and complicated. What would happen if
you fell inside one and what are they really?

3
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,760
First we need to talk about space and time:
Space and time are the grand stage where the

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,120
play of the universe unfolds. But space isn’t
a fixed stage and time doesn’t tick the

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,720
same for everyone everywhere. In short, they
are relative. Matter bends space and bent

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:47,650
space tells matter how to move. Put some stars
and planets on the stage, and it sags underneath

7
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:55,239
them. That misshapen stage, with all its little
warps and dips, gives us gravity. Black holes

8
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,480
do not just bend the stage, they are like
trap doors. Places with so much mass that

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,130
the universe formed a ‘no-go’ zone where
the rules change.

10
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:13,530
Most black holes form when very massive stars
die. We explained this process in detail in

11
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,630
our neutron star video – all you need to
know, that in the final moments of really

12
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,049
massive stars, their insides implode, at nearly
a quarter of the speed of light. This packs

13
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,970
so much mass, so close together that it creates
something so dense that it sort of breaks

14
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,729
the stage of the universe. A black hole with
ten times the mass of the sun would be barely

15
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,010
60 kilometers across.

16
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,700
If you look directly at a black hole it looks
like... nothing. The space under their control

17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,950
is blocked by an invisible, one-way border
called the event horizon. The event horizon

18
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,810
forms a shell around a region of space that,
once entered, is shielded from the rest of

19
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:02,060
the universe forever. Because the black hole
trap door deforms space so much, not even

20
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,700
light can escape it. And with nothing escaping
to transfer information from the inside, it’s

21
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,310
impossible to tell what it really looks like.

22
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,010
We still can observe black holes because of
their effect on matter. Things can orbit black

23
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,609
holes just as they can orbit the sun or a
planet. Many black holes have discs of matter

24
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:27,859
orbiting outside the event horizon. This matter
can become incredibly hot as close orbits

25
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:32,489
can speed this matter up to half the speed
of light, and tiny amounts of friction and

26
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,599
collisions between particles heat them to
a billion degrees, making the space around

27
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,919
these black holes, ironically, incredibly
bright.

28
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,719
What would happen if you would try to get
close, or even inside a black hole? First

29
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,069
of all, you would see the strangest funhouse
mirror in the universe. Matter isn’t the

30
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:57,069
only thing orbiting a black hole: gravity
is so strong near them that light can orbit

31
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:02,849
too. If you hovered just outside the event
horizon, at the photon sphere, in any direction

32
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,719
you’d just see… yourself! Straight ahead
would be the back of your own head, as light

33
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,089
from your back travels around the black hole
to your eyes. Gravity also alters the passage

34
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:19,889
of time itself. The stronger the gravity,
the slower time passes. While you watch the

35
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:25,790
universe above you speed up, those far away
will watch you in slow motion. If you chose

36
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,249
to fly away from the black hole, you might
find that eons have passed for the rest of

37
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:35,700
the universe, a freakish one-way time-travel
trip to the future where your loved ones are

38
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,069
long dead.

39
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:43,620
But getting close to a black hole can be incredibly
dangerous. A painful death by ‘spaghettification’

40
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,559
awaits you. Because your feet are closer to
the black hole than your head they feel a

41
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:54,689
stronger pull of gravity, enough to pull you
apart. As you descend it gets worse, the pulling

42
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:59,500
gets stronger, your body squeezed thinner
and straighter until you’ve been reduced

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,229
to a thin stream of hot plasma, gobbled up
in one final slurp, never to be seen again.

44
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:09,619
Spaghettification is only a risk with smaller
black holes, since they have much smaller

45
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:14,769
radii. If you go to the center of a galaxy
and find a supermassive black hole, you might

46
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,269
be able to experience crossing the event horizon.

47
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,710
As you approach the event horizon, a distant
observer would think they never saw you enter

48
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,560
it, seeing you stop and fade. The last light
you emit trickling up and out, away from the

49
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,840
event horizon. Meanwhile, from your perspective
the void of the black hole rises up to meet

50
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,710
you, as light from fewer directions can reach
you. The blackness envelopes you until your

51
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,169
only view of the universe you left is a tiny
spot of light.

52
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:50,639
Here, inside the event horizon, space and
time are so horribly broken that real time

53
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,870
travel is possible, so it’s probably a good
thing that nothing gets out. If anything could

54
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,830
escape it could create all sorts of time travel
paradoxes and issues that break the universe.

55
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,530
As scary as the event horizon is, it keeps
us safe from that drama.

56
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,430
Whether you have survived this long doesn’t
really matter, as now there is only the certainty

57
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:17,539
of crushing death in your near future. Inside
the event horizon space time itself is so

58
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:22,729
bent and warped, that whatever direction you
move here, every “forward” you go, leads

59
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:27,639
only towards the center of the black hole.
Trying to go any direction only brings you

60
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,419
to the center faster. To survive the longest,
you must do: nothing.

61
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,400
In the center of the black hole, we find the
singularity. A single point with all the matter

62
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,720
that has ever crossed the event horizon, all
crushed to a point infinitely small. There

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,210
is no memory of the things that made it as
stuff disappears down the black hole trapdoor

64
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:55,240
forever. The singularity makes all things
equal. This actually breaks the universe in

65
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,620
really cool ways. We made a whole video about
this problem if you want to learn more. But

66
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,689
in a nutshell, everything that comes too close
becomes black hole matter, concentrated at

67
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,780
the singularity.

68
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,980
This lack of a memory of its past, means that
a black hole has only three properties: their

69
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:19,159
mass, spin, and electric charge. Everything
else is lost. They’re a lot like fundamental

70
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:24,460
particles in that respect. This actually means
that every single black hole in the universe

71
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,350
is the same. Sure, their mass is different
and some spin faster than others. But If we

72
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,449
were to put all the singularities into a magical
physics museum, they would be identical, like

73
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:36,449
electrons.

74
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:42,080
But just like fundamental particles, the properties
of singularities are the best ways we can

75
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,330
describe them on paper, rather than an accurate
representation of reality. Our current theories

76
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:54,970
about the Universe, namely general relativity,
are just not able to describe or explain them.

77
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,620
The curvature of space becomes infinite, density
becomes infinite, and our rules just don’t

78
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,780
make sense. The singularity has no surface
or size, something like a divide-by-zero error

79
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:14,719
in the universe. So singularities might not
even exist or be completely different things.

80
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:19,229
But this is all we know right now, from the
best prediction we have, from our best current

81
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,650
theory of spacetime.

82
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,490
Also, basically everything you’ve ever heard
about black holes, even in this video, is

83
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,210
about theoretical black holes that aren’t
spinning, because their math is so much easier.

84
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,060
But since black holes were born from dying
stars that were spinning extremely quickly

85
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,229
in their last moments, as far as we know,
all black holes in the universe should be

86
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:46,210
spinning right now. At incredible speeds too,
up to 90 % the speed of light. This means

87
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:52,099
in reality, black holes are even more screwed
up than they usually get credit for.

88
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:57,669
The singularities of rotating black holes
are even wilder. The rotation causes them

89
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:04,680
to swell outwards into a sort of ringularity.
This rotation is so powerful, that space itself

90
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,860
is dragged along. This creates another region
around spinning black holes, called the Ergosphere

91
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,210
where it’s impossible to stay still, no
matter how hard you try. Like a rushing whirlpool

92
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,680
of spacetime, the tide is irresistible and
black hole makes you orbit it whether you

93
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,080
want to or not.

94
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,129
Ok. So what will happen with black holes as
the universe ages and dies around them? Again,

95
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:35,299
we don’t know but have some ideas based
on our current understanding of physics: Hawking

96
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:42,788
radiation. In quantum field theory the vacuum
of space is boiling with quantum fluctuations.

97
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,420
These fluctuations are creating matter and
antimatter pairs of particles from nothing

98
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:53,110
which only exist for a very short time before
annihilating. When this happens near the event

99
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,940
horizon of a black hole, one of these particles
can fall in, stopping them from annihilating.

100
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,490
The escaping particle is Hawking radiation.
Ultimately, the mass of this particle must

101
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,779
come from the black hole, so over eons black
holes will shrink and radiate away. Hawking

102
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:15,360
radiation is not the stuff that fell into
the black hole, it’s new stuff, stealing

103
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,310
mass from it. As the black hole shrinks the
Hawking radiation gets stronger, faster and

104
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,540
faster, until what’s left eventually evaporates
in a flash of high energy radiation like a

105
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,370
nuclear bomb. And then, nothing.

106
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,170
But that won’t happen for a long long time.
A black hole with the mass of our sun has

107
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:43,260
a lifetime of 10^67 years. Which means that
it would take 10,000 billion, billion, billion,

108
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:53,870
billion,billion, billion years, to lose 0.0000001%
of its mass. But most black holes are way

109
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,029
more massive than our sun. The most massive
supermassive black holes in the centers of

110
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:07,690
galaxies have lifetimes of 10^100 years. How
long is that? Imagine an hourglass, filled

111
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,790
with one grain of sand for every single particle
in the universe. Every ten billion years one

112
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,899
single grain of sand falls to the bottom.
If we waited for the entire sand to fall down,

113
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:25,560
not even a percent of the lifetimes of these
black holes would have passed. There is no

114
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,870
good concept for our brains to grasp these
time scales.

115
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,690
Will we ever truly understand black holes?
Really know what’s going on inside them?

116
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,519
No one knows. We can only see their outsides,
and the theories we have probably get their

117
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,730
insides wrong. But it’s okay to not know
everything. It just means there is still work

118
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,721
to be done. It means there are still mysteries
to solve and big ideas to think about, which

119
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:59,190
is why humans do science. In the end we at
least can be sure that we still have plenty

120
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:06,910
of time left to think about them before the
last one melts away.

121
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,600
If you want to continue thinking about black
holes a tad more, you can do so by getting

122
