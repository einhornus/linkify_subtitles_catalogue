1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:04,930
Terrorism is very scary, especially
when it happens close to home

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:07,760
and not in some faraway place.

3
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:11,946
Nobody likes to be afraid, and we were
eager to make the fear go away.

4
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:14,856
So we demanded more security.

5
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:17,551
In the last decade, it’s become
increasingly normal

6
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:22,331
for civil liberties to be eroded and for
government agencies to spy on citizens,

7
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:25,938
to collect and store
their personal information.

8
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:29,044
Regardless of whether you’re a fan of
right- or left-wing policies,

9
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:31,107
this affects every one of us.

10
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:34,818
So we have to take a look at the data
and ask ourselves honestly,

11
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:47,988
“Has all of this actually made us safer?”

12
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,939
In the aftermath of 9/11,
the US government concluded

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,807
that the law had not
kept pace with technology.

14
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:55,977
It created the
Terrorist Surveillance Program

15
00:00:55,978 --> 00:01:00,202
initially to intercept communications
linked to al-Qaeda.

16
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:03,573
Officials were confident that if the
program had been in place before 9/11,

17
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:06,263
the hijackers could have been stopped.

18
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:10,781
But soon the new powers were also used
to prove guilt by association.

19
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:13,500
The FBI used immigration
records to identify

20
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:16,525
Arab and Muslim foreign
nationals in the US.

21
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:19,984
On this basis, 80,000 individuals
were required to register,

22
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:22,815
another 8,000 were called in
for FBI interviews,

23
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,839
and more that 5,000 locked up
in preventive detention.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,648
Not one terrorist was found in
what’s been called

25
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:31,481
the most aggressive national
campaign of ethnic profiling

26
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,605
since World War II.

27
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:36,369
How commonplace it’s since become
for government agencies

28
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,969
to collect and store
the personal data of citizens

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,060
was made plain by the leak of
the Snowden documents in 2013.

30
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,456
They showed how the NSA
can demand information

31
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:48,091
about users from firms
like Microsoft or Google

32
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:51,736
in addition to their daily collection of
data from civilian internet traffic

33
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,835
such as email content and contact lists.

34
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:57,031
So, instead of focusing on criminals,

35
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:01,843
governments are increasingly
turning their attention to everyone.

36
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:03,846
But if you are looking
for a needle in a haystack,

37
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:08,775
adding more hay to the stack isn’t going
to make it any easier to find the needle.

38
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:12,140
On the contrary, every recent success
announced by the NSA

39
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:14,882
has come from classic target surveillance.

40
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:17,469
Despite high hopes,
the NSA surveillance program

41
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,098
has not stopped any
major terror attack.

42
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,364
For instance, one of the Boston Marathon
bombers was already a target of the FBI.

43
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:28,464
So what we need is not even
more random data,

44
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:32,806
but better ways to understand and
use the information we have.

45
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:36,528
Spy agenices are also pushing
to cripple encryption.

46
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:40,351
In early 2016, the FBI asked Apple
to produce a backdoor program

47
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:43,370
to disable the encryption
of a terrorist’s iPhone.

48
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,547
Apple publicly declined, not only because
this tool could be used to permanently

49
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,463
weaken the privacy of
law-abiding citizens worldwide,

50
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:53,643
but fearing to open the floodgates for
governments requesting access

51
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:55,990
to a technology used
by billions of people,

52
00:02:55,991 --> 00:03:00,530
a fear shared by security
experts and cryptographers.

53
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:04,810
A few weeks later, the FBI revealed that
they had hacked the phone themselves,

54
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,331
basically admitting that they lied to
the public about the need for a backdoor,

55
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:11,409
which questions how trustworthy
spy agencies are

56
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,695
in the debate about privacy and security,

57
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:17,916
especially considering that the NSA,
for example, already has the capability

58
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:21,595
to turn on your iPhone microphone
or activate your laptop camera

59
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,669
without you noticing.

60
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,048
Concerns about this are often met
with the argument,

61
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,344
“If you have nothing to hide,
you have nothing to fear.”

62
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:33,112
But this reasoning only creates
a climate of oppression.

63
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,398
Wanting to keep certain parts
of your life private

64
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:38,161
doesn’t mean you’re
doing anything wrong.

65
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:40,578
Right now, we live in a democracy.

66
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:44,055
But imagine the damage the wrong person
could do with all our data

67
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,482
and such easy access to our devices.

68
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:51,103
Anti-terrorism laws allow the authorities
to investigate and punish

69
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:54,522
non-terrorism-related crimes
more aggressively.

70
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:58,203
If you give law enforcement powerful
tools, they will use them.

71
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,902
That’s why democratic oversight
is so important:

72
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:03,804
even if those tools and laws aren’t
used against you today,

73
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,098
they might be tomorrow.

74
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,556
For example, following
the November 2015 Paris attacks,

75
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:13,028
France expanded its already
extensive anti-terrorism laws

76
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:16,116
by giving law enforcement greater
powers to conduct house raids

77
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:18,545
and place people under house arrest.

78
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:21,530
Within weeks, evidence emerged that
these powers were being used

79
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:26,293
for unintended purposes, such as
quashing climate change protests.

80
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:28,638
The governments of Spain,
Hungary, and Poland

81
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,700
have introduced more restrictive laws
on the freedom of assembly and speech.

82
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,938
Freedom of expression
and the press in Turkey

83
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,592
has been seriously undermined
in the last few years,

84
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:41,287
with people sentenced to prison
for criticizing the government.

85
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:45,125
None of this is effectively
helping us fight terrorism.

86
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:48,394
The motivation behind this
might be good, even noble,

87
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:51,657
but if we let our elected governments
limit our personal freedom,

88
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,055
the terrorists are winning.

89
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:56,149
What’s worse, if we’re not careful,

90
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,974
we might slowly move
towards a surveillance state.

91
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:04,595
The data is pretty clear: the erosion of
rights, along with mass surveillance,

92
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,468
hasn’t led to significant
successes so far,

93
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:10,899
but it has changed
the nature of our society.

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,085
Terrorism is a complicated problem…

95
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:16,308
…without simple solutions.

96
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,654
No security apparatus
can prevent a few guys

97
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:21,080
from building a bomb in their basement.

98
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:24,410
We should keep the principle
of proportionality in mind.

99
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,077
Creating master keys to
enter millions of phones

100
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:30,292
is not the same as
searching a single house.

101
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:33,725
In most countries, the law already
permits a wide range of actions,

102
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:36,051
including targeted surveillance.

103
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:38,561
To take full advantage of
this existing potential,

104
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,580
we need better international cooperation

105
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,616
and more effective security
and foreign policies,

106
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:48,306
better application of our present laws
instead of new and stricter ones

107
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,449
that undermine our freedom.

108
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,343
Let us not, out of fear, destroy
what we are most proud of:

109
00:05:54,344 --> 00:06:00,421
democracy and our fundamental
rights and liberties.
