1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:06,099
At this very second, you are on
a narrow ledge between life and death.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,299
You probably don't feel it, but there's
an incredible amount of activity

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,259
going on inside you,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,259
and this activity can never stop.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,479
Picture yourself as a Slinky falling down 
an escalator moving upwards.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,399
The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,519
The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,679
To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,419
If you reach the top of the escalator, there's no more falling possible, and you are dead forever.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,359
Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,299
How do you avoid that? And why are you alive?

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:00,999
[Amazing-sounding Kurz Intro Music]

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,919
All life is based on the cell.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,999
A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest so it could do its own thing for a while.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,519
When this separation breaks down, it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe again.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,759
Unfortunately, the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing.

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,979
For some reason, it's not a fan of exciting things, but tries to be as boring as possible.

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,579
We call this principle "entropy," and it's a fundamental rule of our universe.

19
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:41,279
It's pretty complicated and counterintuitive, so we'll explain it in detail in another video.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,199
For now, all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,159
A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions more simpler molecules like water.

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,419
Thousands of complex, self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of thousands of times every second.

23
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:07,459
To stay alive and exciting, it has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy and becoming boring and dead.

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,259
The cell has to maintain a separation from the rest of the universe.

25
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,999
It's doing this, for example, by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different on the inside and the outside

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,208
by actively pumping out excess molecules.

27
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,079
To do stuff like this, a cell needs energy.

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,879
Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work; to move or manipulate a thing; to create change.

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,599
This ability cannot be created or destroyed.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,819
The set amount of energy in the universe will never change.

31
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,119
We don't know why, it just is that way.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,469
So, billions of years ago, one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings was to get usable energy.

33
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,979
We don't know a lot about the first cells, except that they got their energy from simple chemical reactions.

34
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,959
And they found the ultimate energy transfer system: the energetic building block of life.

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,239
The molecule Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP.

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,199
Its structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy.

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,528
When a cell needs energy, for example, to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micro machine,

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:22,799
it can break down ATP, and use the chemical energy to do work and create change.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,439
This is why living beings are able to do stuff.

40
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,079
We don't know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on earth.

41
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,559
But every living thing we know uses ATP, or something very similar, to keep its internal machinery running.

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,379
It's crucial for almost every process.

43
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,959
Plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals need to survive.

44
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,899
Without ATP, no life on Earth.

45
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,119
Possibly anywhere.

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,919
While breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all,

47
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,999
early life did miss out on the greatest available source of energy:

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,259
The Sun.

49
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,679
The Sun merges atoms and radiates photons away that carry energy into the solar system.

50
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,159
But this energy is raw and indigestible.

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,679
It needs to be refined.

52
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,419
After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally, a cell figured out how to eat the Sun.

53
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:28,539
It absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat little chemical packages that it could use to stay alive.

54
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,699
We call this process: Photosynthesis.

55
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,099
You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy,

56
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,219
and use a part of this energy to merge and combine different molecules together.

57
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:46,879
The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the ATP molecule.

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,779
This process became even better, as some cells learned to create better chemical packages:

59
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,899
Glucose, or sugar.

60
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,819
Easy to break down, high in energy, and pretty tasty.

61
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,439
This is so convenient, that some cells decided that instead of doing all that pesky photosynthesis work themselves,

62
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,619
they would just swallow other cells that did, and take their glucose and ATP.

63
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,339
This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history.

64
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,159
And so things went on.

65
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,299
Photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy at their surfaces,

66
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,899
which limited their maximum energy production,

67
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,039
which limited their evolutionary avenues somewhat.

68
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,999
So, time passed.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,439
Some cells made sugar, others ate them.

70
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,259
Evolution did its thing, but overall things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions of years.

71
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,799
Until, one day, a cell ate another, and did not kill it.

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,499
Instead, they became one cell.

73
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,299
Nothing had changed that day, but Earth would be different forever.

74
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,619
This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet.

75
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,679
Blue whales, amoeba.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,779
Dinosaurs, jellyfish.

77
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,299
Pink fairy armadillos, and Sunda colugos.

78
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,359
And of course, you.

79
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,579
All can trace back their existence to this moment.

80
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,399
The merging of two living beings is so important,

81
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,359
because when those two cells became one, they became way more powerful.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,359
The formerly independent cell in the inside, could stop trying to survive.

83
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,419
It could concentrate on one thing: make ATP.

84
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,979
It became the powerhouse of the cell: the first mitochondria.

85
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,799
The host cell's job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world,

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,059
and provide the mitochondria with food.

87
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,879
Mitochondria basically reverse photosynthesis, in a similarly complex process.

88
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,259
They take sugar molecules that we got from eating other living things,

89
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:59,179
combust them with oxygen and precursor molecules, to make new, energy-rich ATP molecules.

90
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,779
This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2,

91
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,359
water, and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat.

92
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,019
This first division of labor, meant the new cell had way more energy available than any cell before,

93
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,339
which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable more complex cells.

94
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,859
At some point, these cells began to form small groups or communities,

95
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,459
which lead to multicellular life, and finally, to you.

96
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,459
Today, you are a pile of trillions of cells, each filled with dozens,

97
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,739
if not hundreds of little machines that provides you with usable energy to stay alive.

98
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,899
If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes, you die.

99
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,819
(Teaser of Kurzgesagt: Science War, coming in 2021.)

100
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:52,199
But if life is so fragile, wouldn't it be a good idea to store ATP, like we store sugar in our fat cells,

101
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,959
so we don't die if we stop breathing for a while?

102
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,279
If life has solved so many problems to make you live today, what's up with the dying quickly thing?

103
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,839
Even simple bacteria like E. Coli make about 50 times their body weight in ATP for every cell division.

104
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,619
Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around.

105
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:24,719
Every day, your body produces and converts about 90 million, billion, billion molecules of ATP: about your own body weight.

106
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,339
You need a whole person's worth of ATP just to make it through a single day.

107
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,678
Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible.

108
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,178
An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly,

109
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:47,139
but it's terrible for storage, since it has only one percent of a glucose molecule's energy at three times its mass.

110
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,599
So ATP is constantly produced and used up fairly quickly.

111
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,939
This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be different from the dead universe,

112
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,819
and to be the slinky on the escalator.

113
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,159
It is a weird story.

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,499
There is this molecule you need to survive at all times.

115
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,639
You need it to keep moving, because even a short break brings your slinky to a stop.

116
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,919
And you need to make it yourself.

117
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,199
It's like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk

118
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,619
with junk that you pick up from the side of the road.

119
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,939
As far as we know, this all began billions of years ago,

120
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,799
when tiny parts of the dead universe came together and became

121
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,759
something else for a moment.

122
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,679
It could keep itself going.

123
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,139
It could grow.

124
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,299
That moment set the slinky in motion, and it's been going ever since.

125
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,419
From the very first cells, to you watching this now.

126
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,819
At some point, you will merge with the rest of the dead universe again.

127
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,179
Maybe you'll tell it stories about your adventures.

128
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,679
Maybe not.

129
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,459
But before you find out,

130
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,179
you get to do what life does best.

131
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,119
Making a dead universe, much more interesting.

132
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,699
(With a Supreme Slinky poster in your room.)

we've got something for you.

135
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,619
We partnered with Skillshare: an online learning community
