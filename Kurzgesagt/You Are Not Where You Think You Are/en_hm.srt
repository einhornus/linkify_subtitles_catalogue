1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,519
Look around you. Where are you? Where is this 
place you are occupying? Somewhere in a room,  

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,679
maybe in a city on a continent on a planet 
orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions.  

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,159
But… where is all of that? While 
this may feel like a daft question,  

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,919
it turns out that the concept of an absolute 
position is something humans made up.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,559
In a nutshell, the universe is a big 
bag of space that has things in it.  

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,959
If someone removed all these things, the 
stars and planets and black holes and dust,  

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,599
there would just be empty space left. 
In empty space, the concept of having  

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,519
a position loses all meaning. Empty 
space is uniform, the same everywhere.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,199
The space we occupy is not like a stage under 
our feet. We can't mark specific points,  

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,599
or staple something to spacetime as an 
anchor. Without things there is no position.  

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,319
We are really ever only at a position 
in relation to something else.  

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,999
Which also means that things we take for granted, 
like up and down are actually relative too.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,879
Ok, let us fill the universe up with things again  

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:24,079
and try to find out where you are, 
right now. Relative to everything else.

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,279
Let us start this video at a familiar place 
and then get increasingly weird. From your  

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,719
perspective the world is seemingly flat and you 
can move in 3 dimensions. It's what physicists  

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,359
call a 'frame of reference' - the perspective 
you have of the universe and how you see things  

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,039
moving around you. Where your up and down 
is. Your frame of reference is correct.  

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,039
For you – but not for the rest of the universe.

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,239
Around 5 kilometers from you, where the horizon 
begins, the ground noticeably curves away from  

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,439
you. If you could see through the ground, 
you’d see people from below or sideways.  

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,639
But they don't fall 'down' off the planet 
because gravity doesn't actually pull them down.  

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,519
'Down' is an illusion of your reference frame. To 
earth's reference frame, gravity just pulls in.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,399
But for humans there is an up and down because 
within our frame of reference that just makes  

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,319
sense. Which is also why we think that the planet 
itself has an up and down, north and south. And  

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,119
we made our maps accordingly. But an observer 
looking at the solar system might disagree.  

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,239
Our maps make sense to us because we are 
used to them, not because they are correct.

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,199
Ok. So this is step one – your position 
on what feels like a flat surface but  

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,039
is actually a sphere. But this sphere is 
always moving, never staying in one position.  

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,199
Earth is orbiting a star, the sun 
at the center of the solar system.

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,919
While we usually imagine this as pretty orderly,  

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,839
someone looking at us from the outside 
would see something pretty messy.  

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,279
To see this more clearly we’ll exaggerate 
all these movements, this is not to scale.

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,759
First of all, our orbit really is an ellipse, 
so we spend half the year sinking a little  

35
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,959
bit closer to the sun speeding up, and half 
the year rising up a bit and slowing down.  

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,759
And the ellipsis itself changes 
its shape every 100,000 years too.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,519
And in another cycle of 112,000 years, the 
ellipse itself is drifting – which at least  

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,879
creates a beautiful shape. In the end, we 
get an orbital path that looks like a wobbly  

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,959
circle with wavy edges. And it gets worse, as 
the moon now starts to screw things up too.

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,799
As the moon is a pretty massive thing, it pulls on 
earth. Both objects orbit their common center of  

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,279
gravity, that lies around 4700 km off to the 
side of Earth’s core. In practice this means  

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,719
that as the moon orbits earth, it is jerking 
earth around a bit, enough to make it jiggle.

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,919
Ok so you are standing on the 
surface of a rotating planet,  

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,959
that is jiggling around the sun in an 
elliptical orbit that changes a bit every year.

45
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,839
But who's to say the earth is right? From  

46
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,999
the perspective of the sun the plane 
of the solar system is arbitrary,  

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,839
it's defined as the plane the earth orbits in 
because that is convenient for us. In reality  

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,839
the other planets are just a little 
bit inclined with respect to our plane.  

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,159
From their point of view, we're the 
ones with a slightly bent orbit.

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,999
But this is not it – far from it! The solar system 
as a whole is orbiting the center of the milky  

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,439
way galaxy. If we look at the milky way, we can 
clearly make out a galactic plane in which the  

52
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,399
solar system orbits the center every 230 million 
years. But of course it is not that simple.

53
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,119
First of all, the plane of the solar system 
is not aligned with the plane of the galaxy.  

54
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,239
Nothing really is – just like the planets in the 
solar system orbit the sun on their own planes, so  

55
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,719
do all the stars orbiting the galactic center. The 
solar system as a whole is tilted about 60 degrees  

56
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,399
towards the galactic plane, speeding through 
space at almost a million kilometers per hour.

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,399
Someone in the center of the galaxy would see 
the orbits of the planets moving through space  

58
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,599
in a helix shape, which you can 
imagine as a corkscrew motion,  

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,079
on the tilted plane of the solar system, 
relative to the plane of the galaxy.

60
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,559
This orientation in space means that sometimes the  

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,879
planets are sort of in front of the sun 
as it orbits around the galactic core.  

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,519
Let us just look at this for a moment 
– there is a strange and eerie beauty  

63
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,159
abouthow our planets and the sun move through 
space. Do you feel a bit dizzy? It gets worse.

64
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,199
This is still not the whole story because the 
mass of the galactic disk is constantly pulling on  

65
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,279
the solar system too. Like a drunk dolphin, we're 
diving down and shooting up hundreds of lightyears  

66
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,519
through the galactic plane, ten times every 
orbit, along arcs thousands of light years long.  

67
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,639
We haven’t mapped this motion out 
completely, as it takes the solar  

68
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,439
system tens of millions of years to go up and 
back once; and, well, humanity is not that old.

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,719
Let’s look at your relative 
position again. On a planet,  

70
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,439
tilted towards the sun, jiggled around by 
the moon. In a solar system tilted towards  

71
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,839
the galactic plane, moving forward in a helical 
shape, diving up and down through the plane.

72
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,679
Hm. But where is “up” in a galaxy? At this point 
the frame of reference becomes a bit arbitrary  

73
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,399
and pointless because of the nature of the 
universe at this scale. The Milky way is  

74
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,279
part of a galaxy group that appears to be part of 
greater structures like the Laniakea Supercluster,  

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,439
which itself is part of the gigantic Pisces–Cetus 
Supercluster Complex and finally a galactic  

76
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,199
filament that spans hundreds of millions of 
lightyears in all directions and orientations.

77
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,959
Someone looking right at us from that far 
away will only see the End of Greatness.  

78
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,079
All stuff appears homogeneous, the same 
everywhere. Just like with empty space,  

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,359
when everything looks the same, who's to say 
anyone's view is better than anyone else's?

80
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,839
We have reached the end of our 
little exercise in cosmic humility.  

81
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,559
Let us make the journey backwards again. From 
the indescribably large, to the really large,  

82
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,399
to our galactic home, to our galaxy, to the solar 
system diving up and down through the milky way,  

83
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,519
to the jiggle of existence. And finally, 
back to you, right now, watching this video.

84
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,199
If this is all a bit much, don’t feel bad. 
The scale of the universe is brain crushing  

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,759
and trying to keep track of how everything is 
oriented or decide where the best up and down is,  

86
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,999
is hard. But it doesn't really matter. 
Because it doesn't change where you are.  

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,479
You're already in the best spot you could possibly 
be – right here, right now. For all you care  

88
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:46,239
nothing can stop you from being right at 
the center of your own little universe.

89
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,759
Perspective really is everything. That is true 
for the universe we all inhabit, but even more  

90
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,919
so within your personal universe. The way your 
life will unfold also depends on what you consider  

91
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,959
possible. Take us at Kurzgesagt: our passion is 
to spark curiosity for science and make videos for  

92
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,679
free. But this is not a great business model so we 
began to create our own lines of science posters,  

93
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,519
calendars and fun kurzgesagt merch - pieces of 
Kurzgesagt - that you can take home and touch.

94
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,839
And we are doing this with Shopify, who 
also were so kind as to sponsor this  

95
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,399
video – which delighted us because we have 
been using their platform for years now.  

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,719
Shopify is an e-commerce platform that 
allows you to start and grow your business.  

97
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,079
And by starting a business, we really do mean 
from scratch: if you want to sell your handmade  

98
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,359
ceramic mugs out of your bedroom today, you can. 
But not just that – if you want to scale your  

99
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,639
one-man show to a sizeable team, then Shopify 
has the tools to support you on your journey.  

100
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,239
Now you just have to get started: go to 
shopify.com/kurzgesagt to get a free 14 day trial.

101
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,759
If you think that this does not apply to you and 
your ideas are too small, we want to encourage you  

102
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,359
to think again: the first video on this channel 
was a university project and Kurzgesagt itself  

103
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,159
was a creative outlet. Eventually we grew 
into a business and the team that is making  

104
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,199
videos for you today. And all of that just 
because we wanted to try out something new.

105
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,439
This is exactly the sort of thing 
that Shopify is determined to support  

106
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,039
and you can build your own thing with it. After 
all, whetheryour idea is still just a dream or  

107
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,319
might turn into a plan today is also just a matter 
of perspective. Millions of businesses in over 175  

108
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,519
countries are currently using Shopify to sell 
their products and we are one of them. Thanks  

109
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:49,840
to them for helping us get here and thanks to 
all of you for making our channel possible.
