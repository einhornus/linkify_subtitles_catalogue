1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,839
hidden in the microverse all around you

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,639
there's a merciless war being fought by

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,079
the true rulers of this planet

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,799
microorganisms

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,479
amoeba protists bacteria archaea and

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,999
fungi compete for resources and space

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,999
and then there are the strange horrors

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,959
that are viruses hunting everyone else

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,839
not even alive they are the tiniest most

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,559
abundant and deadliest beings on earth

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,719
killing trillions every day not

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,759
interested in resources only in living

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,839
things to take over

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,519
also we thought

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,398
turns out there are giant viruses that

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,679
blur the line between life and death and

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,920
other viruses hunting them

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,389
[Music]

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,038
considerably smaller than your cells or

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,679
even bacteria viruses are nothing but a

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,238
hull a tiny bit of genetic material and

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,759
a few proteins

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,999
no metabolism no way to propel

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,039
themselves no will or ambition

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,279
they float around aimlessly and hope to

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,599
stumble upon a victim to infect and take

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,039
over

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,279
viruses are so simple that we're not

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,798
sure if they should count as living

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,559
things or not

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,758
some scientists argue viruses are alive

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,079
others think that the cells they infect

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,559
are the actual living viruses hybrid

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,199
organisms called viral cells and the

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,839
viral particles are more like seeds or

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,199
spores

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,078
and many others think viruses are just

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,839
dead

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,438
material the origin of viruses is a

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,359
mystery because how can something that

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,599
needs victims to make more of itself

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,599
emerge in the first place

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,279
there are many ideas

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,359
viruses may have been essential steps in

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,519
the emergence of life or maybe they

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,319
started out as escaped dna from cells

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,239
that became really good at making copies

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,758
of themselves

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,839
maybe they are the descendants of truly

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,078
lazy parasites that let others do all

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,679
the work for them

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,599
the current thinking is that viruses

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,839
probably emerged multiple times from

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,159
different origins but we simply don't

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,999
know for sure yet

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,399
whatever the truth is viruses are the

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,559
most successful beings on this planet

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,039
there's an estimated 10 000 billion

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,919
billion billion viruses on earth if we

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,439
put them all next to each other they

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,598
would stretch for 100 million light

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,759
years 500 milky way galaxies wide

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,399
very recently viruses became even

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,318
weirder when scientists found a

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,999
completely new type

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,598
giant viruses nicknamed gyrus

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,119
not only did it break all sorts of

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,518
records but questioned many assumptions

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,439
we had about their nature

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,199
gyruses even come with their own

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,598
parasites virophages

72
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,399
viruses that hunt other viruses which

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,719
seemingly makes no sense at all

74
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,719
and since we identified the first one in

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,999
2003 it seems like these giants are

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,878
everywhere we look in the oceans in

77
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,598
water towers in the guts of pigs and the

78
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,439
mouths of humans

79
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,158
and they're even weirder than we thought

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,199
gyruses look funny like hairy geometric

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,919
forms or mini pickles much larger than

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,919
all viruses we knew before which

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,759
explains how they could hide in plain

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,399
sight for centuries scientists saw them

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,158
under their microscopes and just thought

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,399
they had to be bacteria it's like

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,999
suddenly discovering there are

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,878
elephant-sized ducks everywhere

89
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,359
most gyruses we've found so far hunt

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,399
amoebi and other single-celled beings

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,158
when they find a victim they connect

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,559
with it and use its natural processes to

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,399
enter the cell

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,479
like all viruses their goal is to

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,999
misappropriate the victim's

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,878
infrastructure and procreate

97
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,039
imagine a mouse crawling into your mouth

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,039
and using your guts and bones and fat

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,518
tissue to build a mouse factory

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,919
the gyrus unloads its attack proteins

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,318
and genetic material and rearranges the

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,479
cell from the inside

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,399
its structural elements protein

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,399
production machinery and large amounts

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,039
of mitochondria for energy are changed

106
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,199
to become an actual factory called

107
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,719
viroplasm

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,278
some gyruses even construct a membrane

109
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,518
to shield them from the cell's antiviral

110
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,959
defenses

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,439
once finished the viroplasm begins to

112
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,079
assemble new gyruses using the victim up

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,279
from the inside until it's filled up

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,359
finally the invader usually orders the

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,399
cell to self-destruct and releases new

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,039
gyruses to look for new prey

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,599
but what makes gyruses special is not

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,399
their modus operandi or their size even

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,319
it's that they are much more complex

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,279
than thought possible for a virus

121
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,239
your cells have around 20 000 genes

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,879
a typical bacterium has a few thousand

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,799
genes the coronavirus has around 15 hiv

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,799
or the flu around 10.

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,879
the number of genes alone is certainly

126
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,038
not everything the tomato for example

127
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,439
has 35 000 genes

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,279
but generally we think of life as a

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,758
complex system so below a certain

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,079
complexity level something may be closer

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,159
to dead material rather than a living

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,119
organism but gyruses can have hundreds

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,839
or even thousands of genes blurring the

134
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,279
line between living and dead things

135
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,959
and it's not just the numbers that are

136
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,638
special but also what these genes do

137
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,879
we used to think of viral genes as the

138
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,198
simplest of instructions just enough to

139
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,198
overcome the defense of their victims

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,359
and make new viruses

141
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,679
but many gyrus genes are completely

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,879
unique basically mystery genes

143
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,758
even more confusing a huge selection of

144
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,918
their genes that are actually hallmarks

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,519
of living things

146
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,758
genes that regulate nutrient intake

147
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,999
energy production light harvesting

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,399
replication or are just necessary to

149
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,999
keep cells alive

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,999
some recent studies have even suggested

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,079
that some gyruses with very complex

152
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,638
genomes may be able to maintain a basic

153
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,959
level of metabolism on their own which

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,198
if true will shake up what we thought of

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,439
viruses even more

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,599
we still don't know anything for sure

157
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,079
but one idea about gyrus genes is that

158
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,758
they might fundamentally alter the

159
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,679
physiology and evolution of their

160
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,559
victims by integrating their own genomes

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,799
and merging with them into chimeric

162
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,079
organisms

163
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,719
or the other way around take some host

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,038
genes with them and be changed

165
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,959
themselves

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,959
for billions of years gyruses may have

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,359
been existing alongside and infecting

168
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,839
cells exerting an unseen influence on

169
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,679
the development of life

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,079
not just as a parasite but jerking

171
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,239
evolution in different directions by

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,119
mixing genes around in all directions

173
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,198
which brings us to another unique thing

174
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,079
about them virophages the viruses

175
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,679
hunting gyruses

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,198
the concept itself is a bit

177
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,198
mind-boggling how can a thing that might

178
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,279
be dead hunt another thing that might be

179
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,478
dead too

180
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,079
let's look at one of them

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,119
the viruphage sputnik is hunting a gyrus

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,079
called mama virus that itself is hunting

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,198
amoebi

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,839
sputnik is a tiny minimalistic virus

185
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,439
that doesn't even have the genes and

186
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,359
tools to replicate itself

187
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,359
what it does have is the ability to

188
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,758
hijack the viroplasm factories of mama

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,038
viruses

190
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,359
so virophages need their victim the

191
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,559
gyrus to infect their victim an amoeba

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,758
first and then they can parasitize it

193
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,318
a memovirus viroplasm infected by

194
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,038
sputnik can only produce very few new

195
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,279
gyruses and among these many are

196
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,839
deformed and broken unable to infect

197
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,959
further cells instead it makes loads of

198
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,439
new sputnik viruphages

199
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,399
other virophages are even more subtle

200
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,878
when they infect a viroplasm they just

201
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,559
integrate their genetic code into the

202
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,799
newly produced gyruses like sleeper

203
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,318
agents

204
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,318
the next time one of these infiltrated

205
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,038
gyruses successfully infects a cell it

206
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,679
produces mostly viruphages instead of

207
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,279
gyruses

208
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,519
gyruses are not completely defenseless

209
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,478
though

210
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,719
a few years ago the world was in awe

211
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,119
when scientists discovered crispr a

212
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,239
bacterial defense system against viruses

213
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,799
it turns out some gyruses have a system

214
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,279
that might be similar a sort of gyrus

215
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,478
immune system against virophages

216
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,119
in turn virophages can also be used as

217
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,678
an antigyrus defense mechanism by living

218
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,718
cells

219
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,639
some protests have been found that

220
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,239
integrated the genetic code of

221
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,759
virophages into their genome and kept it

222
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,759
when the protists were infected by

223
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,559
gyruses they used the code to create

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,958
virophages themselves to take over the

225
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,919
gyrus factories in the end the protists

226
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,518
would still be killed by the gyrus

227
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,518
infection but instead of releasing

228
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,759
gyruses to kill its buddies it released

229
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,319
virophages to hunt them

230
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,159
the amazing thing about everything we've

231
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,919
told you in this video is that we're

232
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,919
still very much at the beginning

233
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,919
it's not even been 20 years since the

234
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,958
discovery of gyruses and virophages

235
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,719
there is so much going on in the

236
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,239
microverse

237
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,639
life is not an isolated event but a ping

238
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,639
pong game of trillions of organisms and

239
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,999
viruses

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,239
so when you feel down and like there's

241
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,559
not that much new to discover think of

242
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,359
gyruses and all the other elephant-sized

243
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,119
ducks all around us

244
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,119
invisible until we look more closely

245
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,039
but how do you learn to look at the

246
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,119
world like a scientist

247
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,439
the best way is by trying things out for

248
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,479
yourself

249
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,079

and tiny step by tiny step you'll build

269
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,078
up your long-term understanding of

270
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,319
science and get closer to your stem
