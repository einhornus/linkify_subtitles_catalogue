1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,600
hidden in the microverse all around you there's 
a merciless war being fought by the true rulers  

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:16,720
of this planet microorganisms amoeba protists 
bacteria archaea and fungi compete for resources  

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,520
and space and then there are the strange horrors 
that are viruses hunting everyone else not even  

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,920
alive they are the tiniest most abundant and 
deadliest beings on earth killing trillions every  

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:38,160
day not interested in resources only in living 
things to take over also we thought turns out  

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,920
there are giant viruses that blur the line between 
life and death and other viruses hunting them

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,640
considerably smaller than your cells or even 
bacteria viruses are nothing but a hull a tiny  

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,520
bit of genetic material and a few proteins no 
metabolism no way to propel themselves no will  

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,840
or ambition they float around aimlessly and hope 
to stumble upon a victim to infect and take over  

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
viruses are so simple that we're not sure 
if they should count as living things or not  

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,880
some scientists argue viruses are alive others 
think that the cells they infect are the actual  

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,600
living viruses hybrid organisms called viral 
cells and the viral particles are more like seeds  

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:42,080
or spores and many others think viruses are just 
dead material the origin of viruses is a mystery  

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,480
because how can something that needs victims 
to make more of itself emerge in the first  

15
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,280
place there are many ideas viruses may have been 
essential steps in the emergence of life or maybe  

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,880
they started out as escaped dna from cells that 
became really good at making copies of themselves  

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,720
maybe they are the descendants of truly lazy 
parasites that let others do all the work for  

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,040
them the current thinking is that viruses probably 
emerged multiple times from different origins  

19
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,399
but we simply don't know for sure yet whatever the 
truth is viruses are the most successful beings on  

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,240
this planet there's an estimated 10 000 billion 
billion billion viruses on earth if we put them  

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,720
all next to each other they would stretch for 100 
million light years 500 milky way galaxies wide  

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,440
very recently viruses became even weirder 
when scientists found a completely new type  

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,960
giant viruses nicknamed gyrus not only did it 
break all sorts of records but questioned many  

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,040
assumptions we had about their nature gyruses 
even come with their own parasites virophages  

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,160
viruses that hunt other viruses which seemingly 
makes no sense at all and since we identified the  

26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,200
first one in 2003 it seems like these giants 
are everywhere we look in the oceans in water  

27
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,200
towers in the guts of pigs and the mouths of 
humans and they're even weirder than we thought  

28
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,920
gyruses look funny like hairy geometric 
forms or mini pickles much larger than  

29
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,280
all viruses we knew before which explains how 
they could hide in plain sight for centuries  

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,840
scientists saw them under their microscopes 
and just thought they had to be bacteria  

31
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
it's like suddenly discovering there 
are elephant-sized ducks everywhere  

32
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,600
most gyruses we've found so far hunt amoebi and 
other single-celled beings when they find a victim  

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,240
they connect with it and use its natural processes 
to enter the cell like all viruses their goal is  

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,040
to misappropriate the victim's infrastructure and 
procreate imagine a mouse crawling into your mouth  

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,800
and using your guts and bones and 
fat tissue to build a mouse factory  

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,760
the gyrus unloads its attack proteins and genetic 
material and rearranges the cell from the inside  

37
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,440
its structural elements protein production 
machinery and large amounts of mitochondria  

38
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,000
for energy are changed to become an actual 
factory called viroplasm some gyruses even  

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,080
construct a membrane to shield them from the 
cell's antiviral defenses once finished the  

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,080
viroplasm begins to assemble new gyruses using 
the victim up from the inside until it's filled up  

41
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,520
finally the invader usually orders the cell to 
self-destruct and releases new gyruses to look  

42
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,400
for new prey but what makes gyruses special 
is not their modus operandi or their size even  

43
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,960
it's that they are much more complex than thought 
possible for a virus your cells have around 20  

44
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:59,440
000 genes a typical bacterium has a few thousand 
genes the coronavirus has around 15 hiv or the flu  

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,000
around 10. the number of genes alone is certainly 
not everything the tomato for example has 35  

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,960
000 genes but generally we think of life as a 
complex system so below a certain complexity level  

47
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,160
something may be closer to dead material 
rather than a living organism but gyruses  

48
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,240
can have hundreds or even thousands of genes 
blurring the line between living and dead things  

49
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,600
and it's not just the numbers that are special 
but also what these genes do we used to think of  

50
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,200
viral genes as the simplest of instructions just 
enough to overcome the defense of their victims  

51
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:44,160
and make new viruses but many gyrus genes 
are completely unique basically mystery genes  

52
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,480
even more confusing a huge selection of their 
genes that are actually hallmarks of living  

53
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,360
things genes that regulate nutrient intake energy 
production light harvesting replication or are  

54
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,040
just necessary to keep cells alive some recent 
studies have even suggested that some gyruses  

55
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,200
with very complex genomes may be able to maintain 
a basic level of metabolism on their own which if  

56
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,600
true will shake up what we thought of viruses 
even more we still don't know anything for sure  

57
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,360
but one idea about gyrus genes is that they might 
fundamentally alter the physiology and evolution  

58
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,360
of their victims by integrating their own genomes 
and merging with them into chimeric organisms  

59
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,600
or the other way around take some host genes with 
them and be changed themselves for billions of  

60
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,760
years gyruses may have been existing alongside 
and infecting cells exerting an unseen influence  

61
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,240
on the development of life not just as a parasite 
but jerking evolution in different directions by  

62
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,200
mixing genes around in all directions which brings 
us to another unique thing about them virophages  

63
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,360
the viruses hunting gyruses the concept itself is 
a bit mind-boggling how can a thing that might be  

64
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,000
dead hunt another thing that might be dead too 
let's look at one of them the viruphage sputnik  

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,480
is hunting a gyrus called mama virus that 
itself is hunting amoebi sputnik is a tiny  

66
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,720
minimalistic virus that doesn't even have 
the genes and tools to replicate itself  

67
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,240
what it does have is the ability to hijack the 
viroplasm factories of mama viruses so virophages  

68
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,040
need their victim the gyrus to infect their victim 
an amoeba first and then they can parasitize it  

69
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:41,040
a memovirus viroplasm infected by sputnik can only 
produce very few new gyruses and among these many  

70
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,920
are deformed and broken unable to infect further 
cells instead it makes loads of new sputnik  

71
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,360
viruphages other virophages are even more subtle 
when they infect a viroplasm they just integrate  

72
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,680
their genetic code into the newly produced gyruses 
like sleeper agents the next time one of these  

73
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,240
infiltrated gyruses successfully infects a cell 
it produces mostly viruphages instead of gyruses  

74
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,480
gyruses are not completely defenseless 
though a few years ago the world was in  

75
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,280
awe when scientists discovered crispr a bacterial 
defense system against viruses it turns out some  

76
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,680
gyruses have a system that might be similar a 
sort of gyrus immune system against virophages  

77
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,080
in turn virophages can also be used as an 
antigyrus defense mechanism by living cells  

78
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,400
some protests have been found that integrated the 
genetic code of virophages into their genome and  

79
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,080
kept it when the protists were infected by gyruses 
they used the code to create virophages themselves  

80
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,520
to take over the gyrus factories in the end 
the protists would still be killed by the gyrus  

81
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,200
infection but instead of releasing gyruses to kill 
its buddies it released virophages to hunt them  

82
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,960
the amazing thing about everything we've told you 
in this video is that we're still very much at the  

83
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,600
beginning it's not even been 20 years since the 
discovery of gyruses and virophages there is so  

84
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,760
much going on in the microverse life is not an 
isolated event but a ping pong game of trillions  

85
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,400
of organisms and viruses so when you feel down and 
like there's not that much new to discover think  

86
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,600
of gyruses and all the other elephant-sized ducks 
all around us invisible until we look more closely  

87
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,480
but how do you learn to look 
at the world like a scientist
