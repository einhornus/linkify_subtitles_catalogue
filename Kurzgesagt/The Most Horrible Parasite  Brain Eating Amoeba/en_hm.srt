1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,879
A war has been going on for billions of years 
that breeds well armed monsters, who struggle with  

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,959
other monsters for survival. Having no particular 
interest in us, most of them are relatively  

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,839
harmless, as our immune systems deal with 
their weapons easily. But there are exceptions.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,679
Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba 
that has not only developed a  

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,999
deadly taste for human brains but is also a 
match for our defences and stars in dramatic  

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,119
headlines. What happens when 
this monster enters your body?

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,319
Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba, a microbe with a 
nucleus, one of the smallest lifeforms on earth.  

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,839
It is a voracious hunter of bacteria and other 
critters that it devours whole and rips into  

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,639
pieces. Like many amoebea it is able to transform 
into different stages that help it survive,  

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
but most of the time Naegleria 
fowleri is in its trophozoite stage,  

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,439
during which it looks like a squishy blob 
with tiny arms and hunts, divides and thrives.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,239
Its natural home is in fresh water: ponds, 
rivers, lakes and hot springs. But unfortunately  

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,439
it also feels happy in pipes, swimming pools, 
fountains or spas when they are not properly  

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,319
treated. The warmer the water, the more it thrives 
and multiplies. So in the summer, when humans seek  

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,799
to cool off and enjoy themselves, the chances 
are highest that both species will interact.

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,679
Because this makes it hard to avoid, millions of 
people regularly have contact with the amoeba,  

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,479
especially in warmer climates, and many people 
even seem to have antibodies against it.  

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,959
And this is mostly ok, you can even 
swallow it without consequences.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,799
Things turn bad when people dive or swim in water 
contaminated with the amoeba and water splashes  

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,239
high up into their noses. In a single drop 
of lake water there are millions of viruses,  

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,459
bacteria and amoebea and that isn’t really a big 
deal. But Naegleria fowleri is different. Let  

22
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:18,879
us zoom into the nose of an unsuspecting victim 
enjoying a great summer day and see what happens.

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,999
First of all, the amoeba doesn’t 
really want to be inside your nose  

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,239
as it is not really looking for trouble, 
it just wants to eat a few bacteria.  

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,159
Instead it is greeted by your natural defenses. 
Unfortunately for humans, Naegleria fowleri  

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,679
happens to be exceptionally good at generally 
flying under the radar of your immune system.  

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,559
For example, the inside of your nose is covered 
by mucosa, a slime filled with chemicals that  

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,039
kill or stun possible invaders or alert immune 
cells. But Naegleria fowleri is not particularly  

29
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,599
bothered by them and instead calmly checks out the 
scenery, mildly annoyed about the whole ordeal.

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,919
Now, if you are unlucky, the tiny 
critter stumbles over something  

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,479
that actually sparks its interest: Nerve cells.

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,079
Your nose is filled with a large 
network of olfactory nerve cells  

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,279
that pick up molecules from the outside and 
transmit their information to your olfactory bulb,  

34
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,239
the center of smell in your brain. To do 
their job these cells talk to each other by  

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,759
releasing various messenger chemicals and 
recognizing them via specific receptors.  

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,079
One of the most important of 
these chemicals is acetylcholine.

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,999
Through sheer evolutionary bad 
luck, Naegleria fowleri happens to  

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,919
have receptors that recognize acetylcholine.  

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,599
And it seems to attract them irresistibly, a 
little like moths that are attracted by light.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,639
So as your olfactory nerve cells do their job, 
using plenty of acetylcholine to talk to the  

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,119
brain, Naegleria fowleri enters your tissue. It 
seems to follow the chemical signals upstream.  

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,039
Neutrophils, crazy suicide warriors begin to 
attack the amoebae. Individually they have no  

43
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,639
chance against them as the invaders are large and 
pretty buff fighters, used to dealing with tough  

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,079
enemies. So the defenders swarm the intruders 
and kill them either by vomiting chemicals  

45
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,199
that punch holes into them or by literally 
ripping parts of them off and devouring them.  

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,799
But the Naegleria fowleri train is still on track 
and while the Neutrophil attacks slow them down,  

47
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,119
they continue to follow the olfactory 
nerves to their final destination:

48
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,959
Your brain.

49
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,439
This process can take between one and nine days  

50
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,799
and you’ll probably not notice 
anything during that time.  

51
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,799
Until the amoebae reach the olfactory bulb, the 
center of smell and entrance to your brain. Your  

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,079
brain cells are nothing more than helpless victims 
and they all release that wonderful acetylcholine.

53
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,479
Naegleria fowleri initiates a massacre and 
releases an onslaught of various attack molecules.  

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,319
Some of them are basically little bombs 
that rip holes into your cells on contact  

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,239
so their pieces can be eagerly 
consumed. But Naegleria fowleri  

56
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,839
is now multiplying - and it's also becoming 
really creepy. In a feeding frenzy it can  

57
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,999
develop up to a dozen suckers called food cups, 
that look like giant eerie mouths. The amoebae  

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,879
engage your brain cells, suck them in and 
rip large “bites” out of them while they  

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,519
are still alive. Now things escalate quickly 
and the disease that will kill you sets in.

60
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,439
Alerted by the massacre, millions 
of immune cells, Neutrophils,  

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,959
Eosinophils and microglias invade the 
infected tissue. Which is a problem:  

62
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,159
your immune system is dangerous and not 
exactly a careful fighter. It's like  

63
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,479
burning down a forest to kill the wolves 
inside it. A really bad idea in the brain.

64
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,959
They waste no time and attack the amoeba, 
using all the weapons available to them,  

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,519
from chemicals to trying to eat them 
alive. Neutrophils explode themselves  

66
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,719
to erect barriers spiked with deadly 
chemicals. A fierce battle ensues.  

67
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,799
Naegleria fowleri can actually fight back, 
itself attacking and killing many immune cells.

68
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,719
The immune system now throws everything it has at 
the invader but in vain. The complement system,  

69
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,079
tiny protein bombs that can kill intruders on 
their own, are easily disabled. Antibodies,  

70
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,119
usually one of your superweapons, are just 
destroyed or swallowed. A high fever that  

71
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,559
usually slows enemies down does nothing, 
as the amoeba actually thrives in the heat.  

72
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,319
All the while the amoebae continue to 
multiply, fight and devour your brain cells.

73
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,759
A disastrous chain reaction is taking place.  

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,719
One major thing your immune cells do when 
they fight is to cause inflammation. Which  

75
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,199
directs large amounts of fluid from your 
bloodstream into the site of an infection.  

76
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,719
So as the battle rages on without a clear 
winner, more and more fluid enters the brain.

77
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
At this point the human will feel 
symptoms that quickly escalate.  

78
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,839
It all begins pretty vaguely, a headache, fever,  

79
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,759
nausea and vomiting. As the battle spreads 
rapidly through the brain serious symptoms appear,  

80
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,839
from confusion, inability to concentrate 
to fatigue, seizures and hallucinations.  

81
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,559
The brain swells up massively but can’t expand due 
to the bones surrounding it. So it compresses and  

82
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,839
disables the brainstem that controls things like 
breathing. Usually within a week the patient dies.

83
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,919
Up to 97% of patients infected by the 
amoeba share this fate. In almost all cases,  

84
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,879
by the time an infection by Naegleria fowleri is 
recognized the disastrous battle for the brain  

85
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,159
is already so far along that there is almost 
nothing to be done. Not only do we currently  

86
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,199
not have effective treatments, there are also an 
abundance of open questions about how an amoeba  

87
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,919
that usually enjoys its life in open water, is 
able to overcome our immune system so effectively.

88
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,799
So how worried do you need to be about this 
horrifying killer amoeba? Well, not very. While  

89
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,239
the Naegleria fowleri is clearly extremely deadly 
and the infection truly horrible, there have only  

90
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,919
been a few hundred cases in the last few decades. 
You are way more likely to drown in a pool than  

91
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,439
to get infected. Not only does the amoeba need 
to be flushed high up your nose, it also needs  

92
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,399
to get a good grip and it also has to make its 
way through the first lines of your defences.

93
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,039
Ultimately Naegleria fowleri is neither evil 
nor a huge public health risk. But every year  

94
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:33,119
some unlucky people have to deal with it. We still 
have so much to learn about it and until we find a  

95
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,479
way to treat it, Naegleria fowleri will continue 
to be this vague and horrifying thing, hunting  

96
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:50,599
in puddles and lakes and sometimes pools. Usually 
for bacteria. And very occasionally, for people.

97
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,759
- Oh hey, who are you?

98
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,639
It is me, your existential dread!

99
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
- Uhm, ok.

100
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,759
I'm here to make you question your own 
existence and everything you hold dear in life!

101
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,519
- Could you not please.

102
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,719
Tooooooo late, just look at all these amazing 
posters FULL of humbling visualisations like the  

103
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:21,199
scale of the universe. LOOK! How huge it is and 
how small you are! Look at the education edition,  

104
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,679
how it dives deep into the history of evolution or 
all these other scientific fields to make you feel  

105
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,719
bad for all the stuff you don't know! Or 
look at this one, IT GLOWS IN THE DARK!

106
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,839
- But Dread, these do make me feel good 
actually! They do fill me with excitement  

107
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,399
and awe about how amazing our universe is and 
I love learning! And look how pretty they are!

108
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:54,639
Nooooooooo, I can't persist in 
the presence of awe. Graglgrglglg.

109
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,239
If you too want to overcome your existential 
dread, make your life beautiful and also support  

110
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,039
Kurzgesagt so we can put thousands of hours 
into our videos and release them for free,  

111
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,959
you can get these and many many 
more amazing posters or shirts or  

112
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,479
so many more things in our shop. We put as 
much care into our products as into our videos,  

113
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,199
trying to find something clever or a new angle 
that will challenge your perspective while still  

114
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:31,840
teaching you the core aspects. It’s the best 
way to support what we do on this channel.
