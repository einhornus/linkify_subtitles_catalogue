1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,639
Neutron Stars are one of the most extreme and

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,039
violent things in the Universe.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,459
Giant atomic nuclei,

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,794
only a few kilometres in diameter,

5
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:15,599
but as massive as stars. And they owe their existence to

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,379
the death of something majestic

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:29,099
[Kurzgesagt intro]

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,014
Stars exist because of a fragile balance.

9
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:36,114
The mass of millions of billions of trillions

10
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:39,154
of tons of hot plasma are being pulled inwards by

11
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:42,134
Gravity and squeeze material together with so much force

12
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:44,724
that nuclei fuse.

13
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:47,199
Hydrogen fuses into Helium.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,159
This releases energy which pushes against gravity and tries to escape

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,239
As long as this balance exists,

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,879
stars are pretty stable

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,159
Eventually, the hydrogens will be exhausted

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,519
Medium stars like our Sun go to a Giant phase

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,559
where they burn Helium into Carbon and Oxygen

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,599
before they eventually turned into White Dwarfs.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,319
But in stars many times the mass of our Sun,

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,919
things get interesting when the Helium is exhausted.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,199
For a moment, the balance of pressure and radiation tips

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,199
and the gravity wins - squeezing the star tighter than before

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,559
The core burns hotter and faster while the outer layers

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,984
of the star swell by a hundreds of times,

27
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,959
fusing heavier and heavier elements.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,739
Carbon burns to Neons for centuries,

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,599
Neon to Oxygen in a year, Oxygen to Silicone in months

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,879
and Silicone to Iron in a day

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,839
And then, death.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,994
Iron is nuclear ash. It has no energy to give

33
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:48,814
and cannot be fused

34
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:52,084
The fusion suddenly stops, and the balance ends.

35
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:55,599
Without the outward pressure from fusion, the core is crushed

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,479
by the enormous weight of the star above it

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,379
What happens now is awesome and scary

38
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,559
Particles like electrons and protons

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,799
really don't want to be near each other

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,599
but the pressure of the collapsing star is so great

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,564
that electrons and protons fused into neutrons

42
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:17,154
which then get squeezed together as tightly as atomic nuclei

43
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:20,114
An iron ball the size of Earth is squeezed into

44
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:23,439
a ball of pure nuclear matter the size of a city

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,039
But not just the core, the whole star implodes

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,994
Gravity pulling the outer layers in

47
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:31,674
at 25% the speed of light

48
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:34,304
This implosion bounces off the Iron core

49
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:37,454
producing a shockwave that explodes outwards

50
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:40,434
catapults the rest of the star into space.

51
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:43,484
This is what we called a Supernova explosion

52
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:47,594
and it will outshine entire galaxy

53
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:50,654
What remains of the star, is now a Neutron star

54
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,664
Its mass is around a million times the mass of the Earth

55
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:58,239
but compressed to an object about 25 kilometres wide

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,934
It's so dense that the mass of all living humans

57
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:04,664
would fit into 1 cubic centimetre of Neutron star matter

58
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:06,804
That's roughly a billion tonnes

59
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:09,759
in a space a size of a sugar cube.

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
Put another way, that's Mount Everest

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,319
in a cup of coffee

62
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,519
From the outside, a Neutron star is unbelievably extreme

63
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,519
Its gravity is the strongest outside Black Holes,

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,039
and if it were any denser, it would become one

65
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,999
Light is bent around it - meaning you can see the front

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,364
and parts of the back

67
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:33,279
Their surfaces reach a million degree Celcius

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,879
compared to a measly 6,000 degrees for our Sun

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,919
Okay, let's look inside a Neutron star

70
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,119
Although these giant atomic nuclei are stars,

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
In many ways, they're also like planets

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,479
with solid crust over liquid core

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,059
The crust is extremely hard

74
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,399
The outermost layers are made of Iron leftover from the Supernova

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,479
squeezed together in a crystal lattice

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,439
with a sea of electrons flowing through them

77
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,239
Going deeper gravity squeezes nuclei

78
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,679
closer together

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,999
We find fewer and fewer protons as most merged to neutrons.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,599
Until we reach the base of the crust

81
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,219
Here, nuclei are squeezed together so hard that they start to touch.

82
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,379
Protons and neutrons rearranged

83
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,518
making long cylinders or sheets

84
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,879
Enormous nuclei with millions of protons and neutrons

85
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,519
shaped like spaghetti and lasagne, which physicist called Nuclear Pasta

86
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,999
Nuclear Pasta is so dense,

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,639
that it maybe the strongest material in the Universe - basically unbreakable

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,319
Lumps of pasta inside a Neutron star can even make mountains

89
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,614
at most a few centimetres high

90
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:44,159
but many times as massive as the Himalayas

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,439
Eventually, beneath the pasta, we reach the core

92
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,839
We're not really sure what the properties of matter are

93
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,839
when they're squeezed this hard

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,039
Protons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarks

95
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,619
a so called quark-gluon plasma

96
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,814
Some of those quarks might turn into Strange quarks

97
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,594
making a sort of Strange matter, with properties

98
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,754
so extreme that we made a whole video about it

99
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:09,784
Or maybe they just stay protons and neutrons

100
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:13,299
No one knows for sure and that's why we do Science.

101
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,279
That's all pretty heavy stuff, literally

102
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,639
so let's go back out into Space

103
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,039
When neutron stars first collapse, they begin to spin very very fast

104
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,774
like a ballerina pulling her arms in

105
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,799
Neutron stars are cellestial ballerinas

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,639
spinning many times per second.

107
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,639
This creates pulses because their magnetic field creates a beam of

108
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,159
radio waves, which passes every time they spin

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,839
These radio pulsars are the best known type of Neutron star

110
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,759
about 2,000 are known of in the Milky Way

111
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,959
These magnetic fields are the strongest in the Universe

112
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,279
a quadrillion times stronger than Earth after they're born

113
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,039
They're called Magnetars until they calm down a bit

114
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,599
But the absolute best kind of neutron stars

115
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,774
are friends with other neutron stars

116
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,754
By radiating away energy as gravitational waves

117
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:07,844
ripples in space-time, their orbits can decay

118
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,319
and they can crush into and kill each other

119
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,454
in a Killnova explosion that spews out a lot of their guts.

120
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:17,454
When they do, the conditions become so extreme

121
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:20,564
that for a moment, heavy nuclei are made again

122
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:23,699
It's not fusion putting nuclei together this time,

123
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,299
but heavy neutron-rich matter falling apart

124
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,184
and reassembling

125
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:31,224
Only very recently, we've learnt that this is probably

126
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,259
the origin of most of the heavy elements in the Universe

127
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,639
like Gold, Uranium, and Platinum and dozens more

128
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,639
So then our two neutron stars collapsed and become a black hole

129
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,799
dying yet again

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,039
Not only does stars have to die to create elements,

131
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,879
they have to die twice.

132
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,239
Over millions of years, these atoms

133
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,684
will mix back into the Galaxy, but some of them end up in cloud

134
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:59,934
which gravity pulls together to form stars and planets

135
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:01,919
repeating the cycle

136
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,099
Our Solar System is one example, and the remains of those

137
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,259
neutron stars that came before us

138
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,074
are all around us

139
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:12,024
Our entire technological modern world was built

140
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:15,474
out of the elements neutron stars made in eons passed

141
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:18,719
sending these atoms on 13-billion-year journey

142
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,119
to come together and make us and our world

143
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,974
And that's pretty cool

144
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:29,234
Until then, we can look them on paper

145
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:32,114
The 12,020 year human space era calendar

146
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:33,279
has arrived

147
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,884
You could order it now until we sell out, and then never again

148
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:40,734
Visit the cloudy cities of Venus

149
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:43,524
Dyson's swarm assembly on Mercury

150
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:46,799
and cross the borders of our Solar system

151
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,239
Shipping from the U.S. and from Europe the first time

152
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,839
But we deliver to every country all over the world

153
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,879
You can also get a plushee or hoodie or poster

154
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,839
We have some sweet deals for you

155
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,879
Get it for Christmas for your friends, families and kids

156
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,119
or to distract yourself from the fact there are

157
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,099
100 billion billion Earth-like planets in habital zone of

158
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,899
Sun-like stars in the obsrevable Universe

159
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,374
and you will never visit any of them

160
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,154
The last few years we sold them all, so no rush

161
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:20,264
but the clock is ticking

162
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:23,114
Getting stuff from our shop is on eof the best ways

163
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:26,174
to support Kurzgesagt. Because of you

164
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:29,214
we can keep this channel free for everyone and make more

165
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:32,234
beautiful things. A happy interstellar year

166
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:33,785
12,020
