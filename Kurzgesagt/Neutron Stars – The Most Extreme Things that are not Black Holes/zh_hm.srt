1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,239
中子星喺宇宙之中一種極端而又狂野嘅星體
Neutron stars are one of the most extreme and violent things in the universe.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,459
似粒巨型原子 直徑只有幾百公里
Giant atomic nuclei, only a few kilometers in diameter,

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,699
但質量可以同行星相比
but as massive as stars.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:21,859
佢地嘅誕生歸功於的星體壯麗嘅死亡
And they owe their existence to the death of something majestic.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:28,919
[音樂~~]
[Intro music]

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,859
行星內有種脆弱嘅平衡
Stars exist because of a fragile balance.

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,759
數億億億噸熱等離子
The mass of millions of billions of trillions of tons of hot plasma

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,959
被重力拉向星體中心
are being pulled inwards by gravity,

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,799
物質被不斷擠壓
and squeeze material together with so much force

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,799
直到出現核融合
that nuclei fuse.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,359
氫原子融合產生氦原子
Hydrogen fuses into helium.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,839
過程中釋放巨大嘅能量
This releases energy,

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,179
抵銷重力嘅擠壓 並且發出輻射
which pushes against gravity and tries to escape.

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,899
只要這種平衡存在，行星就會保持穩定
As long as this balance exists, stars are pretty stable.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,459
直到氫原子會被耗盡
Eventually, the hydrogen will be exhausted.

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,559
好似太陽咁嘅中型行星會變成紅巨星
Medium stars, like our Sun, go through a giant phase,

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,519
氦原子融合產生碳原子同氧原子
where they burn helium into carbon and oxygen

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,739
最終紅巨星變成白矮星
before they eventually turn into white dwarfs.

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,479
但係比太陽重得多的星體
But in stars many times the mass of our Sun,

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,699
當氫原子被耗盡，事情就更加有趣
things get interesting when the helium is exhausted.

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,619
有時
For a moment,

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,159
重力同輻射嘅平衡中
the balance of pressure and radiation tips,

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,479
重力較強
and gravity wins,

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,139
星體被壓縮
squeezing the star tighter than before.

25
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,239
令核心燒得更熱更快
The core burns hotter and faster,

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,559
星體外層膨脹幾千倍
while the outer layers of the star swell by hundreds of times,

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,179
越來越重嘅元素被燃燒
fusing heavier and heavier elements.

28
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,599
在幾百年中，碳融合產生氖
Carbon burns to neon in centuries,

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,759
一年內，氖融合成氧
neon to oxygen in a year,

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,839
幾個月內，氧融合變矽
oxygen to silicon in months,

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,799
一日內，矽變鐵
and silicon to iron in a day.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,019
突然，
And then…

33
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,619
死亡。
…death.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,539
鐵係核融合嘅灰燼
Iron is nuclear ash.

35
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,039
鐵融合無得釋放能量
It has no energy to give and cannot be fused.

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,239
融合突然停止，重力勝利 :(
The fusion suddenly stops, and the balance ends :(

37
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
無咗由核融合產生嘅向外輻射壓，
Without the outward pressure from fusion,

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,539
巨大嘅恆星外殼重重地向核心塌縮
the core is crushed by the enormous weight of the star above it.

39
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,439
驚嘆又恐怖。
What happens now is awesome and scary.

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,559
電子質子之類嘅粒子
Particles, like electrons and protons,

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,419
唔係好中意黐埋一齊
really don’t want to be near each other.

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,459
但塌縮嘅壓力十分巨大
But the pressure of the collapsing star is so great

43
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,339
質子電子融合變成中子(電子捕獲)
that electrons and protons fuse into neutrons,

44
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,119
中子緊緊地擠埋一齊好似咁原子核咁
which then get squeezed together as tightly as in atomic nuclei.

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,239
一個地球大小嘅鐵球
An iron ball, the size of the Earth,

46
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,459
被壓成一粒城市太小嘅原子核
is squeezed into a ball of pure nuclear matter, the size of a city.

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,999
唔止星體核心，
But not just the core;

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,699
整個星體內爆
the whole star implodes,

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,699
外層被重力以光速嘅四分一拉向中心
gravity pulling the outer layers in at 25% the speed of light.

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,419
物質撞擊鐵核心並反彈
This implosion bounces off the iron core,

51
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,199
產生向外嘅衝激波
producing a shock wave that explodes outwards

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,359
部分嘅質量射咗出太空
and catapults the rest of the star into space.

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,499
呢個就係 超新星爆炸
This is what we call a supernova explosion,

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,499
強度足以照耀整個星系
and it will outshine entire galaxies.

55
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,659
而家，恆星剩低嘅就係叫中子星
What remains of the star is now a neutron star.

56
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,839
佢嘅質量係地球嘅幾百萬倍
Its mass is around a million times the mass of the Earth

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,979
不過，被壓縮到大約25公里嘅大小
but compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide.

58
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,899
緻密嘅程度就好似將全人類嘅質量
It’s so dense that the mass of all living humans

59
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,719
壓縮到幾厘米嘅正方體 [好恐怖]
would fit into one cubic centimeter of neutron star matter.

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,899
呢粒方糖大小嘅東東
That’s roughly a billion tons

61
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,879
大約有十億頓重
in a space the size of a sugar cube.

62
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,859
換種講法，
Put another way,

63
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,439
就係擺珠穆朗瑪峰落個咖啡杯度
that’s Mount Everest in a cup of coffee.

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,419
從外面嚟睇，中子星係難以想像嘅極端。
From the outside, a neutron star is unbelievably extreme.

65
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,659
佢重力嘅強度僅次於黑洞
Its gravity is the strongest, outside black holes,

66
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,139
如果密度再高少少，就會變成黑洞
and, if it were any denser, it would become one.

67
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,779
周圍嘅光線會被折曲
Light is bent around it,

68
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,359
即係話你會見到佢正面同佢遮住咗嘅野
meaning you can see the front and parts of the back.

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,079
表面溫度高達一百萬度
Their surfaces reach 1,000,000 degrees Celsius,

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,879
而太陽僅僅只有 6000 度
compared to a measly 6,000 degrees for our Sun.

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,919
好。睇幾中子星入面
Okay, let’s look inside a neutron star.

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,939
雖然佢地係成粒恆星咁大嘅巨型原子核，
Although these giant atomic nuclei are stars,

73
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,339
佢地某程度又似擁有
in many ways, they’re also like planets,

74
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,599
固態外殼同液態核心嘅行星
with solid crusts over a liquid core.

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,959
外殼十分堅硬
The crust is extremely hard.

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,399
最外層由超新星爆炸後剩低嘅鐵組成
The outermost layers are made of iron left over from the supernova,

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,599
呈現晶體結構
squeezed together in a crystal lattice,

78
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,659
電子係原子核間流動
with a sea of electrons flowing through them.

79
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,619
不斷深入，原子核比重力擠壓得更緊密
Going deeper, gravity squeezes nuclei closer together.

80
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,699
質子變得越來越少
We find fewer and fewer protons,

81
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,159
因為同電子合併咗做中子
as most merge to neutrons

82
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,579
到外殼嘅底層
until we reach the base of the crust.

83
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,439
係呢度，原子核被擠壓得
Here, nuclei are squeezed together so hard

84
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,099
可以互相接觸
that they start to touch.

85
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,139
質子同中子重新排列
Protons and neutrons rearrange,

86
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,319
成圓筒/薄板狀
making long cylinders or sheets,

87
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,419
數以百萬計質子同中子組成嘅巨型嘅原子核
enormous nuclei with millions of protons and neutrons

88
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,419
形狀就好似意粉同千層麵
shaped like spaghetti and lasagna,

89
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,679
物理學家叫做核子意粉(nuclear pasta) [唔識中文]
which physicists call nuclear pasta.

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,439
Nuclear pasta 好可能係宇宙中嘅最強物質
Nuclear pasta is so dense that it may be the strongest material in the universe,

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,759
堅不可摧
basically unbreakable.

92
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,099
中子星內嘅核子麵團
Lumps of pasta inside a neutron star

93
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,419
構成嘅山脈
can even make mountains

94
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,559
得幾厘粒高嘅
at most a few centimeters high,

95
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,139
但足足有喜馬拉雅山咁重
but many times as massive as the Himalayas.

96
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,939
係呢啲意粉下面
Eventually, beneath the pasta,

97
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,439
我地到達中子星嘅核心
we reach the core.

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,059
目前核心物質嘅特性仲唔係好清楚
We’re not really sure what the properties of matter are

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,659
當佢地處於咁硬淨嘅狀態
when they’re squeezed this hard.

100
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,919
質子同中子可能熔解成夸克海
Protons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarks,

101
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,479
叫做 夸克-膠子等離子體
a so-called quark-gluon plasma.

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,999
有啲夸克可能變成 奇夸克
Some of those quarks might turn into strange quarks,

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,899
組成奇異物質
making a sort of strange matter,

104
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,399
擁有極端嘅特性
with properties so extreme,

105
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,619
我地有一條關於佢嘅片
that we made a whole video about it.

106
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,779
又或者佢地會保持係質子同中子狀態
Or maybe they just stay protons and neutrons.

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,139
真相無人知曉
No one knows for sure,

108
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,299
所以先會有科學
and that’s why we do science.

109
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,179
呢啲都係好沉重嘅野
That’s all pretty heavy stuff,

110
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,079
真係好重。
literally.

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,759
睇返係太空嘅視角
So let’s go back out into space.

112
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,879
當中子星形成， (超新星塌縮)
When neutron stars first collapse,

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,219
佢開始自轉，好快咁轉
they begin to spin very, very fast,

114
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,939
好似芭蕾舞者縮埋雙手 (外殼撞向核心)
like a ballerina pulling her arms in.

115
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,459
中子星係天空上嘅芭蕾舞者
Neutron stars are celestial ballerinas,

116
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,939
每秒轉好多次
spinning many times per second.

117
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,579
造成脈衝
This creates pulses

118
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,739
因為佢地嘅磁場產生一束無線電波
because their magnetic field creates a beam of radio waves,

119
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,259
每轉一圈就有一個信號
which passes every time they spin.

120
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,019
脈衝星
These radio pulsars

121
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,219
係種好出名嘅中子星
are the best-known type of neutron star.

122
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,939
係銀河系入面就有 2000 個已知嘅脈衝星
About 2,000 are known of in the Milky Way.

123
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,159
有啲中子星嘅磁場係宇宙最強
These magnetic fields are the strongest in the universe,

124
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,199
比地球磁場強 1000000000000000 倍
a quadrillion times stronger than Earth’s after they’re born.

125
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,679
佢地叫做 磁星
They’re called magnetars

126
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,059
直到磁場减弱
until they calm down a little.

127
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,539
而最出名嘅中子星類型
But the absolute best kind of neutron stars

128
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,899
係中子星雙星
are friends with other neutron stars.

129
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,859
以重力波形式釋放能量
By radiating away energy as gravitational waves,

130
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,539
係時空中造成漣漪
ripples in spacetime,

131
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,919
佢地嘅軌距會衰減
their orbits can decay,

132
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,199
然後撞埋一齊，同歸終盡。
and they can crash into and kill each other

133
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,859
叫做 千新星爆炸
in a kilonova explosion

134
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,559
噴出巨量物質
that spews out a lot of their guts.

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,359
合併時，環境十分極端
When they do, the conditions become so extreme

136
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,619
有更重嘅原子核產生
that, for a moment, heavy nuclei are made again.

137
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,599
今次唔係核融合將原子核黐埋一齊
It’s not fusion putting nuclei together this time,

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,319
而係重得嚟又有豐富中子嘅物質 (核子意粉)
but heavy neutron-rich matter

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,159
撞散嘅同時又重組
falling apart and reassembling.

140
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,639
最近，
Only very recently,

141
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,099
我地估計，呢個爆炸可能係宇宙之中較重元素嘅來源
we’ve learned that this is probably the origin of most of the heavy elements in the universe,

142
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,719
例如黃金、鈾同鉑
like gold, uranium, and platinum,

143
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,879
等等
and dozens more.

144
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,679
而家
So there now

145
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,719
兩粒中子星撞埋一齊變成一個黑洞
two neutron stars collapse and become a black hole,

146
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,959
再死一次。
dying yet again.

部分會組成星雲
but some of them end up in a cloud,

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,839
呢啲原子經過 130 億年嘅旅程
sending these atoms on a thirteen-billion-year journey
