1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:07,379
Space travel is the most exciting and challenging adventure humanity has ever undertaken.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,479
But in an irony 
of history,

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,779
we may stop ourselves from going 
into space the more we do it.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,579
With every 
rocket launched

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,559
and with every 
satellite deployed,

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,639
we're creating a trap for ourselves that gets 
deadlier and more dangerous every year.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,299
If it's ever activated,

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,959
it could end the Space Age

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,299
and trap us 
on our planet for decades,

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:41,299
or even centuries.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,039
Getting something into space 
is incredibly hard.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,539
To do so, you need 
to move very, very fast.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,639
At first, straight up
to leave the atmosphere,

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,699
then sideways to begin 
a sort of circling around the Earth,

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,859
still, very, very fast.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,879
If you do that successfully 
you can enter a Low Earth orbit.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,199
And once in orbit,

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,519
it's very hard 
to get out of orbit.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,479
Unless you have 
energy to spare,

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,259
you're sort of locked in here, 
falling around the Earth forever.

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,999
That's great for things 
we want to stay up,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,879
like space stations 
and satellites.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,619
And so we moved the majority of humanity's 
space infrastructure to this place,

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,339
just a few hundred kilometers 
above the surface.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,559
Just high enough

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,779
so that the atmosphere 
is so thin,

27
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,399
that orbiting things 
can stay up for centuries

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,119
before air resistance can slow them 
enough to bring them back to Earth.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,199
But this is also the source 
of our deadly trap.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,559
Rockets are really metal cylinders 
that keep big parts of fuel in place.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,159
Whenever a portion 
of the fuel has been spent,

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,339
the empty tanks are dropped 
to make the rocket lighter.

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,239
Some parts 
crash down to earth

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,879
or burn up 
in the atmosphere.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,839
But most of the useless 
rocket parts stay up

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,079
and begin 
to orbit the planet.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,039
After decades 
of space travel

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,119
low Earth orbit

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,319
is a junkyard of spent boosters,

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
broken satellites and millions 
of pieces of shrapnel

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,279
from missile tests 
and explosions.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,758
Right now we know of around 
2,600 defunct satellites,

43
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,879
10,000 objects bigger 
than a monitor,

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,459
20,000 as large 
as an apple,

45
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,899
500,000 pieces 
the size of a marble

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,569
and at least 100 million parts 
so small they can't be tracked.

47
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,119
This debris is moving 
at speeds of up to 30,000 km/h,

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,269
circling Earth on criss-
crossing orbits multiple times a day.

49
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,439
Orbital speeds are so fast 
that being hit by debris

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,959
the size of a pea is like 
being shot by a plasma gun.

51
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,259
On impact the debris

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,899
vaporises, releasing enough energy 
to punch holes straight through solid metal.

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,869
So, we've covered the space around our planet with millions of deadly pieces of destruction,

54
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,839
and we also put a trillion dollar 
global infrastructure network

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,459
right in the danger zone.

56
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,219
It performs critical duties 
essential to the modern world:

57
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,369
global communication,

58
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,829
GPS 
and navigation,

59
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,389
collecting weather data,

60
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,039
looking out 
for asteroids

61
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,219
and all manner 
of scientific discoveries:

62
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,159
things we would miss very much 
if they suddenly went away.

63
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,679
If just one pea-sized bullet 
hits one of our

64
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,009
1,100 working satellites, 
it will be destroyed instantly.

65
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,599
Three or four satellites are already 
being destroyed this way every year.

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,039
As the number of satellites and the amount of junk in orbit is expected to grow tenfold in the next decade,

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,399
we're approaching 
a tipping point.

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,819
But the worst thing in space 
is not tiny pieces of junk.

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,079
The worst thing would be 
an unstoppable chain reaction

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,429
that turns a lot of non junk things 
into junk. For example:

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,219
if two satellites hit each other 
in just the right way.

72
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,639
If satellites collide

73
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,799
they don't stop 
and fall out of the sky.

74
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,159
It's more of a splash 
than a crash.

75
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,339
Orbital speeds 
are so fast

76
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,679
solid pieces spray 
right through each other,

77
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,559
transforming the two satellites 
into clouds of thousands of little things

78
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,068
still fast enough 
to destroy more satellites.

79
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,639
This could trigger the slowest 
and most destructive sort of domino effect:

80
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,059
a collision cascade.

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,739
Like a shotgun spray,

82
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,839
each collision 
creates more bullets.

83
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,299
What was once 
a single tiny target

84
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,099
very unlikely to hit anything becomes 
a wall of destruction

85
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,299
hungry 
to make more.

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,519
As more and more satellites 
are destroyed

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,959
the destruction 
accelerates exponentially,

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,459
eventually destroying 
everything parked in orbit.

89
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,179
But space 
is very empty,

90
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,219
so the first few collisions 
may take a long time.

91
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,559
By the time we realize 
what's happening, it's too late.

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,059
One year one satellite 
is destroyed

93
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,059
and that's 
no big deal.

94
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,439
The next year, five.

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,419
The year after, 50.

96
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,999
Until there's nothing left.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,939
The situation in orbit 
is rapidly worsening

98
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,939
and we may already 
be past the point of no return.

99
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,059
Within 10 years space around Earth may no longer 
be viable for long term satellites or rockets.

100
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,499
The worst case scenario 
is horrifying.

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,419
A debris field made of hundreds 
of millions of pieces,

102
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,979
many too small to track,
moving at 30,000 km/h.

103
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:20,659
It would effectively create 
a deadly barrier around Earth, possibly too dangerous 
to cross.

104
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,479
Dreams 
of moon bases,

105
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,899
Mars colonies 
or space travel at all

106
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,119
may be 
set back centuries.

107
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,379
And the loss 
of our space infrastructure

108
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,409
would send some of the technology 
we rely on daily back to the 1970s.

109
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,379
But it might not be too late 
to clean up our mess.

110
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,799
While the space industry has become 
better at avoiding space junk,

111
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,079
it's still growing fast and occasional 
weapon tests don't help.

112
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,859
So there have been a couple of wild 
but also serious suggestions.

113
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,499
About how to quickly remove 
as much deadly space junk as possible

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,919
without creating more 
in the process.

115
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,319
Lots of ideas 
are being thrown around,

116
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,619
and some 
of the most seriously considered

117
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,119
involve capture 
and return missions,

118
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,219
which are 
being tested now.

119
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,519
One method involves meeting a piece of junk
in orbit with a small satellite and loaded with a net.

120
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,599
Once caught,

121
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,139
a small rocket could be used 
to bring it down towards Earth.

122
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,919
Targets too large for a net might be instead caught 
with a harpoon on a tether.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,539
Instead of firing 
a rocket

124
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,939
the cleaner would deploy a large sail 
to produce atmospheric drag

125
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,599
and accelerate
orbital decay.

126
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,259
And there are lots of other wild sci-fi 
sounding proposals too.

127
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,779
Some might use 
giant electromagnets.

128
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,379
These magnetic tugs

129
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,059
work by pushing on 
the magnetic components inside satellites

130
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,719
that they use 
to stabilize

131
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,959
and orientate themselves 
in Earth's magnetic field.

132
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,819
These may be safer and more reliable 
than nets and harpoons

133
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,519
because they never have to make contact 
with the junk they're handling,

134
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,019
so there's no risk of accidentally breaking up 
their target into more junk.

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,019
As for the tiniest bits of junk,

136
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,699
lasers might be the key 
to vaporising them entirely.

137
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,639
Satellites with lasers wouldn't 
need to visit their targets.

138
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,919
They can shoot them 
from far away.

139
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,339
Large objects 
can't exactly be shot down,

140
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,879
but lasers 
can be used to ablate them,

141
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,639
or burn tiny amounts 
of material off the side

142
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,259
to push the junk 
to a safer orbit.

143
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,239
Whatever technology we use at the end,
we better start doing something soon,

144
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,399
before 100 million bullets become 
a trillion and the trap is set.

145
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,719
If we don't act,

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,419
our adventure 
in space

147
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,179
might end before 
it's even begun.

148
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,739
If our days of dreaming about space exploration 
might be numbered anyway

149
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,319
we better put them 
to good use.

150
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,439
One of the things we most like to spend our time on 
is learning more about our universe.

151
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,499
And to do that

152
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,219
you can just keep watching.

153
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,659
Kurzgesagt and Brilliant 
are collaborating on a six-part video series

154
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,959
about our favorite science 
and space topics.

155
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,099
Kurzgesagt has worked 
with Brilliant for a bit.

156
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,239
And we love how they teach you science 
and maths in a practical way.

157
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,759
By guiding you through problems 
step by step.

158
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,139
So you can actually understand 
the concepts behind them.

159
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,539
And maybe one day

160
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,559
use your knowledge 
on problems like space junk.

161
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,899
Or at least your science projects to start with.

162
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,619
