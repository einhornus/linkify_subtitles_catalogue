1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,699
Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,779
They don't seem to make any sense at all.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,299
Where do they come from...

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:15,679
...and what happens if you fall into one?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,639
Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,139
that collapsed from enormous gas cloud under their own gravity.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,979
In their core, nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,399
releasing a tremendous amount of energy

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,619
This energy, in the form of radiation,

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,319
pushes against gravity,

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,919
maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,679
As long as there is fusion in the core,

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,179
a star remains stable enough.

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,039
But for stars with way more mass then our own sun

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,739
the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,299
until they reach iron.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,419
Unlike all the elements that went before,

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,579
the fusion process that creates iron

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,499
doesn't generate any energy.

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,499
Iron builds up at the center of the star

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,499
until it reaches a critical amount

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,479
and the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,379
The core collapses.

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,059
Within a fraction of a second,

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,719
the star implodes.

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,719
Moving at about the quarter of the speed of light,

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,379
feeding even more mass into the core.

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,519
It's at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are created,

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,019
as the star dies, in a super nova explosion.

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,439
This produces either a neutron star,

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,299
or if the star is massive enough,

32
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,399
the entire mass of the core collapses into a black hole.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,979
If you looked at a black hole,

34
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,019
what you'd really be seeing is the event horizon.

35
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,139
Anything that crosses the event horizon

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,439
needs to be travelling faster than the speed of light to escape.

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,799
In other words, its impossible.

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,779
So we just see a black sphere

39
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,479
reflecting nothing.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,279
But if the event horizon is the black part,

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,299
what is the "hole" part of the black hole?

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,079
The singularity.

43
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,399
We're not sure what it is exactly.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,819
A singularity may be indefinitely dense,

45
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,039
meaning all its mass is concentrated into a single point in space,

46
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,879
with no surface or volume,

47
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,359
or something completely different.

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,359
Right now, we just don't know.

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,758
its like a "dividing by zero"error.

50
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,679
By the way, black holes do not suck things up like a vacuum cleaner,

51
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,539
If we were to swap the sun for an equally massive black hole,

52
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,359
nothing much would change for earth,

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,919
except that we would freeze to death, of course.

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,959
what would happen to you if you fell into a black hole?

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,999
The experience of time is different around black holes,

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,079
from the outside,

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,899
you seem to slow down as you approach the event horizon,

58
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,899
so time passes slower for you.

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,779
at some point, you would appear to freeze in time,

60
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,899
slowly turn red,

61
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,859
and disapear.

62
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,719
While from your perspective,

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,119
you can watch the rest of the universe in fast forward,

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,419
kind of like seeing into the future.

65
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,439
Right now, we don't know what happens next,

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,039
but we think it could be one of two things:

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,419
One, you die a quick death.

68
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,519
A black hole curves space so much,

69
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,039
that once you cross the event horizon,

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,219
there is only one possible direction.

71
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,399
you can take this - literally - inside the event horizon,

72
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,419
you can only go in one direction.

73
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,759
Its like being in a really tight alley that closes behind you after each step.

74
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,239
The mass of a black hole is so concentrated,

75
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,399
at some point even tiny distances of a few centimeters,

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,119
would means that gravity acts with millions of times more force on different parts of your body.

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,899
Your cells get torn apart,

78
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,919
as your body stretches more and more,

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,919
until you are a hot stream of plasma,

80
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,559
one atom wide.

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,979
Two, you die a very quick death.

82
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,119
Very soon after you cross the event horizon,

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,439
you would hit a firewall and be terminated in an instant.

84
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,879
Neither of these options are particularly pleasant.

85
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,159
How soon you would die depends on the mass of the black hole.

86
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,719
A smaller black hole would kill you before you even enter its event horizon,

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,859
while you probably could travel inside a super size massive black hole for quite a while.

88
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,059
As a rule of thumb,

89
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,099
the further away from the singularity you are,

90
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,779
the longer you live.

91
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,939
Black holes come in different sizes.

92
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,679
There are stellar mass black holes,

93
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,639
with a few times the mass of sun,

94
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,499
and the diameter of an asteroid.

95
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,059
And then there are the super massive black holes,

96
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,239
which are found at the heart of every galaxy,

97
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,199
and have been feeding for billions of years.

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,179
Currently, the largest super massive black hole known,

99
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,279
is S5 0014+81.

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,278
40 billion times the mass of our sun.

101
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,279
It is 236.7 billion kilometers in diameter,

102
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,719
which is 47 times the distance from the sun to Pluto.

103
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,699
As powerful as black holes are,

104
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,939
they will eventually evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation.

105
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,539
To understand how this works,

106
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,519
we have to look at empty space.

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,499
Empty space is not really empty,

108
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,079
but filled with virtual particles popping into existence

109
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,759
and annihilating each other again.

110
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,319
When this happens right on the edge of a black hole,

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,179
one of the virtual particles will be drawn into the black hole,

112
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,119
and the other will escape and become a real particle.

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,899
So the black hole is losing energy.

114
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,099
This happens incredibly slowly at first,

115
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,019
and gets faster as the black hole becomes smaller.

116
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,119
When it arrives at the mass of a large asteroid,

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,139
its radiating at room temperature.

118
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,839
When it has the mass of a mountain,

119
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,639
it radiates with about the heat of our sun.

120
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,499
and in the last second of its life,

121
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,819
the black hole radiates away with the energy of billions of nuclear bombs in a huge explosion.

122
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,739
But this process is incredibly slow,

123
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,519
The biggest black holes we know,

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,519
might take up a googol year to evaporate.

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,819
This is so long that when the last black hole radiates away,

126
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,219
nobody will be around to witness it.

127
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,599
The universe will have become uninhabitable,

128
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,799
long before then.

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,619
This is not the end of our story,

130
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,479
there are loads more interesting ideas about black holes,

131
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,660
we'll explore them in part 2.
