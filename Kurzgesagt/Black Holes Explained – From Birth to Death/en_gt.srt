00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,779
Black holes are one of the weirdest things out there.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,959
They don't seem to make any

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,539
sense Where do they come from?  And, what happens if you fall into one?

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,679
â™«

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,839
Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,259
that have collapsed from huge clouds of gas under their own gravity

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,899
In this way, nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,639
, thus releasing a tremendous amount of energy.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,139
form of radiation, force against gravity.

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,959
Maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,259
As long as there is fusion in the core, the star remains stable

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,039
But for stars much more massive than our Sun

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,299
The heat and pressure in the core allows it to fuse heavier elements until IRON is reached

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,639
Different  of the elements that came before, the fusion process that created iron does not generate energy

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,579
Iron accumulates in the center of the star until it reaches a critical amount

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,559
And the balance between Radiation and Gravity is broken

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,419
The core collapses

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,719
And, within a fraction of a second, the  star implodes

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,399
Moving at approximately 1/4 the speed of light, feeding even more mass to the center of the core

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,619
It is at this very moment that all the heaviest elements in the universe are created

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,939
As the star dies, exploding in Supernova

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,239
This produces a Neutron Star

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,439
Or, if the star is massive enough, the entire mass of the core collapses into a black hole.

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,079
If you looked into a black hole, what you would actually be seeing would be  The Event Horizon

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,159
Anything that was going to cross the Event Horizon

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,379
would have to be traveling faster than the Speed of Light to escape. In ot

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,839
er words, it's impos

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,779
ible.  So we just see a black sphere, reflecting nothing.

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,259
But if the Event Horizon is the black part, what is the ''Hole'' part of the Black Hole?

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,039
The Singularity

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,299
We don't know what it is, exactly

32
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,539
A Singularity can be of infinite density

33
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,819
Which is to say that all its mass is concentrated in a single point in space, with no surface or volume

34
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,179
Or something completely different

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,439
At the moment, we just don't know

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,918
It's like  the age of ''Dividing by Zero'

37
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,719
' Black holes don't happen to suck things up like a vacuum cleaner

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,899
If we were to trade the sun for a black hole of equivalent mass

39
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,919
Nothing much would change on Earth, except that we'd freeze to death, of course  .

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,939
What would happen to you if you fell into a Black Hole?

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,099
The feeling of time is different around Black Holes,

42
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,019
From the outside you would seem to slow down as you approach the Event Horizon

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,319
So time slows down for you

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,759
At some point you would seem to freeze in time, slowly turn red,

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,219
And disappear

46
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,159
Whereas, from your perspective, you could watch the rest of the universe at advanced speed

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,419
Kind of like seeing the future

48
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,979
At the moment, we don't know what would happen next, but we think it could be one of two things:

49
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,579
One: You die a quick death.

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,119
Black Hole curves space so much that once you cross the Event Horizon

51
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,419
There would be only one possible direction

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,319
You can understand that literally inside the Event Horizon you can only go one direction

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,899
It's like being in a very tight alley that closes behind you  you after each step

54
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,339
The mass of a black hole is so concentrated

55
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,499
that at some point even tiny distances of a few centimeters would

56
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,279
mean that gravity would act millions of times m  More force in different parts of your body

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,779
Your cells would be ripped out as your body is stretched further and further

58
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,619
Until you become a stream of boiling Plasma, the size of an atom

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,899
Two: You die a very quick death

60
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,499
As soon as you cross the Event  Horizon, you would hit a wall of fire and be wiped out

61
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,819
None of the options are exactly

62
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,119
fun How fast you would die depends on the mass of the Black

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,919
Hole A small Black Hole would kill you before you even enter Event Horizon

64
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,039
While you could probably travel inside  a Super Massive Black Hole for a good amount of time

65
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:59,579
So the farther away from the Singularity you are, the longer you live

66
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,759
of an asteroid

67
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,299
And there are also the Super Massive Black Holes, which are found at the heart of every Galaxy

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,259
And it has been feeding for billions of years.

69
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,479
The known Super Massive Black Hole is S50014+81

70
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,159
Forty billion times the mass of our Sun

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,339
It is 236.7 Billion kilometers in diameter

72
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,779
Which is 47 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto

73
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,639
Even though Black Holes are so powerful

74
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,959
They will eventually evaporate  through a process called Hawking Radiation

75
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,479
To understand how this works, we have to look at ''Empty Space''

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,279
''Empty Space'' is not really empty,

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,179
but filled with virtual particles, shooting into existence, and nullifying  each other

78
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,279
When this happens on the edge of a Black Hole, one of the particles will be drawn into the Black Hole

79
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,159
And the other will escape, becoming a real particle

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,859
So the Black Hole will lose energy

81
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,899
This happens very slowly at first

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,959
But it gets longer  fast as the Black Hole shrinks

83
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,119
When it gets to the mass of a large asteroid it will be radiating at room temperature

84
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,759
When it has the mass of a mountain it will radiate approximately with heat  of our Sun

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,699
And in the last second of its life, the Black Hole radiates with the force of billions of Nuclear Bombs in one big explosion

86
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,999
But this process is incredibly slow

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,439
The biggest Black Holes we know can take up to a Googol years to evaporate

88
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,279
That's  so long that when the last Black Hole ceases to exist, nothing will be alive to witness

89
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,119
The Universe will have become uninhabitable long before

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,479
This is not the end of our story, there is still a lot to talk about Black Holes

91
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,679
And we will talk more about them in  Part

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,799

You can get them on our Patreon page Which
