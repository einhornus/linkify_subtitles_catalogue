1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,519
What if you could use genetic engineering to stop humanity's most dangerous predator?

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,119
The deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions -

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,839
- the mighty mosquito.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,159
Along with other diseases, it plays host to malaria,

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,219
one of the cruelest parasites on earth,

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,699
possibly the single biggest killer of humans in history.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,279
In 2015 alone, hundreds of millions were infected.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,119
Almost half a million people died.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,139
A new technology could help us eradicate malaria for ever.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,799
But to do so, we need to engineer a whole animal population.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,039
This is not a hypothetical problem,

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,759
The modified mosquitoes already exist in a lab.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,919
Should we use the technology, and is malaria bad enough to risk it?

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,679
[THEME MUSIC]

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,439
Malaria is caused by a group of micro-organisms.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,679
Plasmodia.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,279
Very weird micro-organisms, that consist of just a single cell.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,879
They're parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,619
Malaria always starts with an insect bite.

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,759
In its salivary glands, thousands of sporozoites wait until the insect penetrates your skin.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,479
Immediately after invading you, they head for the liver,

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,719
where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,979
For up to a month, they stay here, in stealth mode, consuming the cells alive and changing into their next form -

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,999
small, drop-like merozoites.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,799
They multiply, generating thousands of themselves,

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,699
and then burst out of the cells.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,639
So thousands of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next victims -

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,879
Red blood cells.

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,799
To stay unnoticed, they wrap themselves in the membranes of the cells they killed.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,139
Imagine that,

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,659
killing someone from the inside,

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,399
and then taking their skin as camouflage.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,359
Brutal.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,439
They now violently attack red blood cells,

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,699
Multiplying inside them until they burst, then finding more red blood cells.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,339
This cycle repeats over and over

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,339
Pieces of dead cells spread lots of toxic waste material,

38
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,299
which activates a  powerful immune response causing flu-like symptoms.

39
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,899
Among the symptoms are high fever, sweats and chills,

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,199
convulsions, headaches and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea.

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,619
If malaria reaches the blood-brain barrier, it can cause coma, neurological damage, or death.

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,279
The parasites are ready for evacuation now.

43
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,759
When another mosquito bites the infected human, they get a ride.

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,379
The cycle can start over.

45
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,019
In 2015, the Zika virus,

46
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,139
which causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women,

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,099
spread rapidly into new areas around the globe.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,879
It too is carried by a mosquito.

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,959
The mosquito is the perfect carrier for human diseases ,

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,559
They've been around for at least 200 million years,

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,059
there are trillions of them,

52
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,539
and a single one can lay up to 300 eggs at a time.

53
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,999
They are practically impossible to eradicate,

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,419
and the perfect parasite taxi.

55
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,179
But today, we have new revolutionary technology

56
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,159
that could enable us to finally win the war against them.

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,279
CRISPR.

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,479
For the first time in human history,

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,699
we have the tools to make fast, large-scale changes to entire species,

60
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,139
changing their genetic information as we please.

61
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,719
So, instead of attacking isolated groups of insects,

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,959
why not just change the types that transmit diseases?

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,279
Using genetic engineering,

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,659
Scientists successfully created a strain of mosquitos that are immune to the malaria parasite,

65
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,299
by adding a new antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,919
These mosquitoes will never spread malaria.

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,639
But  just changing genetic information is not enough.

68
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,499
The edits would only be inherited by half the offspring,

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,639
because most genes have two versions inside the genome as a fail- safe.

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,919
So after just two generations, at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene.

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,119
In a population of billions of mosquitoes,

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,819
They would hardly make a difference

73
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,139
A genetic engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem.

74
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,479
It  forces the new gene to become dominant in the following generations,

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,819
overpowering the old gene almost completely.

76
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:25,799
Thanks to this twist, 99.5% of all the engineered mosquitoes' offspring will carry the anti-malaria edit.

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,399
If we were to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes,

78
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,259
The malaria-blocking genes would spread extremely quickly.

79
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,699
As the new gene becomes a permanent feature of the mosquito population,

80
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,059
plasmodium would lose its home base.

81
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,079
Scientists hope that the change would be so fast, they could not adapt to it quickly enough.

82
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,039
Malaria could virtually disappear.

83
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,839
If you take into account that almost half a million children are killed by it every year,

84
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,019
about five have died since this video started.

85
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,919
Some scientists argue that we should use the technology sooner, rather than later.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,039
The mosquitoes themselves would probably only profit from this.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,839
They don't have anything to gain  from carrying parasites.

88
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,459
And this might only be the first step - malaria might  just be the beginning.

89
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,839
Different mosquitoes also carry Dengue fever and Zika

90
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,799
Ticks transmit lyme disease,

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,579
Flies transmit sleeping sickness,

92
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,419
Fleas transmit the plague.

93
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,879
We could save millions of lives, and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale.

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,819
So,why haven't we done this yet?

95
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,719
For one, CRISPR editing is barely four years old,

96
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,439
so until very recently, we just couldn't do it as fast and easily.

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,439
And there are valid concerns.

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,699
Never before have humans consciously changed the genetic code of a free-living organism on this scale.

99
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,919
Once we do it, there is no going back.

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,599
So it has to be done right,

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,559
because there could be unwanted consequences if we set out to edit nature

102
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,359
In the specific case of malaria though,

103
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,699
the risk might be acceptable since the genetic modification doesn't make a big change in the overall genome,

104
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,699
It only changes a very specific part.

105
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,219
The worst case scenario here, is probably that it might not work,

106
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,559
or that the parasite adapts in a negative way.

107
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,319
There is still much debate,

108
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,759
Technology as powerful as gene drive needs to be handled with a lot of care.

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,259
But at some point, we have to ask ourselves,

110
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,219
Is it unethical to not use this technology,

111
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,779
when everyday, one thousand children die?

112
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,739
Humanity has to decide how to act on this  in the next few years.

113
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,739
The public discussion is way behind the  technology in this case,

114
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,879
What do you think?

115
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,739
This video was made possible in part by viewer donations on patreon.

116
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,039
If you want to help us make more videos like this and get nice rewards in return,

117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,319
you can do so here.

118
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,099
We really appreciate it.

119
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,079
If you want to learn more about the topic of genetic engineering,

120
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,179
we have another video about CRISPR and GMO's.

121
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,980
And in case that's too much  biology for you, here's a space playlist.
