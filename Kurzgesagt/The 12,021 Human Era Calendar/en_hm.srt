00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,103
For the fifth time we present 
to you the Human Era Calendar for the year 12,021 -

2
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:11,606
this time it is  all about the journey of humanity, beginning tens of thousands of years ago, 

3
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:18,614
leading into the revolution of agriculture, to ancient high civilizations and the beginning of modern times,

4
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:21,519
culminating in a vision for our future.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,569
You can get the limited Edition now until we 
sell out and then never again.   

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,639
As always the calendar features 12 illustrated pages printed on high quality paper in Europe and the US.   

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,159
And this year the cover is especially shiny.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,519
Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream about a glorious future  

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,522
and realize how far we have come as a species. 
It is also the best way to support kurzgesagt.  

10
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:53,656
The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for free, for everyone.

11
00:00:53,657 --> 00:01:00,147
If you want, you can get the calendar with a Hoodie or infographic posters or plushie. We've made a few deals for you.

12
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:04,238
Thank you so much to the thousands of 
people who get the calendar every year  

13
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,870
and to the birbs who love what 
we try to do on this channel. 

14
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:16,851
We wish you a happy year 12,021 – And let’s all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020!
