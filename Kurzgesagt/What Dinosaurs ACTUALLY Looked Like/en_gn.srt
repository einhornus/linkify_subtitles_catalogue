1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,839
the past is a vast and mysterious land

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,719
that begins at the big bang and ends in

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,359
the present expanding with each passing

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,399
moment

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,239
it's the home of everything that came

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,479
before the key to understanding our

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,518
present

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,759
here we find the most amazing creatures

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,999
to ever roam our planet hundreds of

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,559
millions of species so diverse that our

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,358
imagination cannot do them justice

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,079
unfortunately the past carefully guards

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,678
its secrets

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,278
while there are a lot of things about

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,359
the past we know there are way more

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,398
things we know we don't know and worse

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,479
there are probably even more things we

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,480
don't even know that we don't know about

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,189
[Music]

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,159
think of the wonder of life

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,119
we now recognize about 1.5 million

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,599
eukaryotic species but there may be as

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,319
many as 10 million alive today

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,959
and although we are adding some 15 000

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,719
new species to our collective knowledge

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,199
each year the vast majority of life on

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,399
earth is still undiscovered

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,118
this is just what is around today

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,079
an estimated 4 billion species emerged

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,959
on our planet in past eons

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,839
but at least 99 of them died out way

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,639
before humans spoke the first words

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,559
the vast majority of all the different

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,519
species that ever existed are so utterly

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,758
deleted that they have become part of

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,039
the unknown unknown part of the past

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,519
lost to us forever

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,679
or are they

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,719
could we use science and imagination to

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,398
glimpse a shadow of the unreachable past

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,199
let's start with what we do know

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,199
to learn about creatures of the past we

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,599
need fossils any sort of remains

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,239
preserved from past geological ages

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,199
bones or shells impressions or imprints

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,839
things preserved in amber

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,078
the totality of all fossils on earth is

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,999
called the fossil record and it's the

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,999
most important window on the past will

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,597
ever have

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,839
for a dead animal to fossilize a number

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,238
of things must go just right

53
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,479
the right environment timing and

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,759
conditions

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,759
and then the fossil needs to survive for

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,359
millions or hundreds of millions of

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,759
years and then get back to the surface

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,679
and then be discovered before natural

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,839
processes dissolve it

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,839
so it is kind of a miracle that we have

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,119
what we have and know what we know

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,279
take the dinosaurs since they were one

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,359
of the largest and most successful

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,318
groups of animals for some

65
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,039
165 million years and are also a lot of

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,479
fun to animate

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,479
what were they really like and what are

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,839
we missing

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,559
in the last 200 years we've found tens

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,958
of thousands of fossils from over 1 000

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,559
dinosaur species

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,878
lately we've entered a golden era of

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,119
discovery and about 50 new dinosaur

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,878
species are discovered each year

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,119
expanding what we know and what we know

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,119
that we don't know about them which is

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,679
amazing but it also makes us aware of

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,199
all the things lost to the past forever

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,039
imagine if we took all the animals that

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,439
lived in the last 50 million years and

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,479
randomly chose 10 000 individuals from 1

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,199
000 species to fossilize

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,719
think about all the things that would be

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,919
missed or that seem too weird to be true

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,839
like the giraffe a yellow animal with

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,839
brown patterns that looks like a horse

87
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,999
and an antelope had a baby with a long

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,798
neck and two tiny hairy horns

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,919
how many dinosaur giraffes were there

90
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,318
animals so weird and selected for

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,719
ecological niches so specific that

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,798
evolution molded their bodies very

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,359
absurdly today they might seem made up

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,878
to us

95
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,279
we know a lot of species are lost

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,279
forever just because of the environment

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,399
they lived in

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,878
for example lush jungles basically

99
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,199
prevent fossilization as the chances

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,279
that an animal will be buried here are

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,559
low

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,639
countless scavengers of all sizes break

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,639
down freshly deceased animals extremely

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,958
quickly and the soil is often so acidic

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,039
that bones are dissolved

106
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,438
and so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,839
are practically non-existent

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,477
today half of all known species live in

109
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,719
the few remaining rainforests that only

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,599
cover 2 percent of earth's land mass

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,679
millions of years ago when dinosaurs

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,918
roamed earth jungles covered much more

113
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,599
of the planet

114
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,159
so besides some insects and other small

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,239
animals trapped in amber there should be

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,239
millions of species that emerged and

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,959
vanished without leaving any trace

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,559
trapped deep inside the unknown unknown

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,839
but just in general biology trips us up

120
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,319
look at your body it's mainly squishy

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,959
gooey soft stuff which does not preserve

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,279
well what remains the longest are the

123
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,519
crystallized parts of your bones and so

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,638
most dinosaur fossils are bones or teeth

125
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,319
usually fragments not entire skeletons

126
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,478
this means that almost all boneless or

127
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,799
shellless animals are practically wiped

128
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,559
from the fossil record

129
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,079
if we take a look at the stunning

130
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,638
diversity of weird animals like worms

131
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,279
jellyfish and slugs alive today we can

132
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,599
only speculate what we are missing

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,999
although thankfully many mostly soft and

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,319
gooey species also left us an incredible

135
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,319
diversity of shells that tell us an

136
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,719
amazing amount about our past so at

137
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,799
least we have that

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,478
still when we think about all the

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,319
boneless species that may have existed

140
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,799
in the last half billion years even our

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,879
best attempt at imagining them falls

142
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,599
short but it's not like reimagining

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,359
something based on its bones is

144
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,119
straightforward and so the way we

145
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,198
envisage what dinosaurs actually looked

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,359
like has changed a lot in the last few

147
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,399
years

148
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,638
in the past many illustrations had a

149
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,799
bony minimalistic look with a toothy

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,159
grin to signify fierceness and danger

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,159
but if we draw today's animals in a

152
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,559
similar way based on their skeletons

153
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,399
just for the fun of it we get the most

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,318
bizarre creatures

155
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,279
elephants swans and baboons that look

156
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,318
like monsters right out of nightmares

157
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,799
so similar to animals today we should

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,038
imagine dinosaurs with much more soft

159
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,079
tissue fat bellies or chests weird soft

160
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,959
parts like skin flaps lips and gums and

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,879
just more pronounced features that would

162
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,959
make them seem like much more pleasant

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,239
fellows

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,079
some soft features actually leave

165
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,239
distinctive traces on bones that we can

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,079
look for in the skeletons of extinct

167
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,239
animals which is where today's animals

168
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,359
with similar features are really helpful

169
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,839
it's a similar story with colors

170
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,439
because we know what the feathers of

171
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,839
living birds look like modern technology

172
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,439
combined with the exceedingly rare

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,359
fossils with preserved remains of fuzzy

174
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,519
feathers give us a glimpse of the real

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,918
colours of extinct dinosaurs

176
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,159
we know that tiny sinusorptoryx had a

177
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,799
striped tail and its tiny dino buddy

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,359
angkianis huxley was white and black

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,359
with gorgeous red feathers around its

180
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,399
head

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,559
still for the vast majority of really

182
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,038
any ancient extinct species we have no

183
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,279
real clue what colour they were

184
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,918
but we know what modern dinosaurs birds

185
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,318
look like and here we find the most

186
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,478
amazing variety

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,318
so some dinosaurs will have tried to

188
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,478
blend into the background while others

189
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,999
might have fielded aggressive colour

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,159
schemes to attract mates or to appear

191
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,519
dangerous

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,879
some might have had impressive

193
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,359
decorations or colorful beaks

194
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,318
some may have been striped or patent

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,478
similarly we don't know that much about

196
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,799
dinosaur behavior although once again we

197
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,478
can draw conclusions from existing

198
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,598
animals for example even apex predators

199
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,598
like lions spend a lot of their time

200
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,758
lying around and cuddling and licking

201
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,598
each other and playing

202
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,159
why would dinosaurs be so different

203
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,159
when we first found the skull of t-rex

204
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,159
with its mighty teeth and probably the

205
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,478
strongest bite of any land animal ever

206
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,758
we imagined a fierce and stupid beast

207
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,439
but modern scanning technology has

208
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,198
revealed the t-rex had a larger

209
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,439
brain-to-body ratio than some earlier

210
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,758
giant meat-eaters and it probably had

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,918
very sharp hearing vision and a sense of

212
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,638
smell and was in all likelihood not a

213
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,159
stupid animal

214
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,799
so maybe t-rex was a cuddly fellow that

215
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,638
spent a lot of time playing around or

216
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,399
impressing potential mates when it was

217
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,239
not hungry

218
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,399
likewise while their horns and shields

219
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,239
might have made ceratopsids appear to be

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,399
natural-born fighters they were probably

221
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,079
much more than that

222
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,158
based on the behavior of modern animals

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,079
and the complex dances some have to go

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,398
through to mate maybe their shields were

225
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,199
amazingly colourful maybe it danced for

226
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,158
its mates like many birds do today

227
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,639
how intensely amazing these creatures

228
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,079
must have been

229
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,239
and what a loss it is to us that we

230
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,518
don't get to experience them first hand

231
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,439
what an even greater loss that there is

232
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,278
so much we will never know about them

233
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,319
and even more tragic all the absurd and

234
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,079
beautiful beings that disappeared

235
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,759
without a trace

236
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,919
but such is life

237
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,159
time marches on without any concern for

238
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,719
our feelings and the past expands with

239
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,879
every moment that passes

240
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,439
most wild animals alive today will in

241
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,079
all likelihood not leave fossils behind

242
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,199
and also just disappear forever

243
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,439
we can do something about that though

244
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,199
instead of accelerating the extinction

245
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,278
we are witnessing we could become the

246
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,439
guardians of life and preserve it where

247
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,719
we find it

248
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,199
if possible in the world if not then in

249
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,479
museums movies and in our minds

250
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,119
because as amazing as our imagination is

251
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,799
and as fascinating to think about the

252
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,879
animals that are part of the unknown

253
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,439
unknown it is even better to witness

254
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,278
them in the present

255
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,239
the land that we actually inhabit where

256
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,880
we get to experience life as it happens

257
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,479
there is one more exciting way to

258
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,958
experience dinosaurs though this year

259
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,319
the 12022 human era calendar eons

260
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,439
edition

261
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,838
as always we're adding 10 000 years to

262
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,439
the regular calendar to represent the

263
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,439
human era and include all cultures

264
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,679
around the world but this year we're

265
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,078
expanding the scope beyond humanity to

266
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,999
showcase forgotten animals and plants

267
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,719
from all across the phanerozoic eon like

268
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,199
giant armoured fish scythe lizards or

269
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,479
giant sloths on 12 elaborate pages

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,559
witness how multicellular life has

271
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,799
persisted for over half a billion years

272
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,359
surviving asteroid impacts volcanoes and

273
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,799
frozen oceans and of course pandemics

274
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,479
in the end life er finds a way and we

275
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,518
want to celebrate that

276
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,599
