1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,179
The past is a vast and mysterious land that
begins at the big bang and ends in the present,

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:09,820
expanding with each passing moment.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,309
It is the home of everything that came before,
the key to understanding our present.

4
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:20,439
Here we find the most amazing creatures to
ever roam our planet, hundreds of millions

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,560
of species so diverse that our imagination
cannot do them justice.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,009
Unfortunately the past carefully guards its
secrets.

7
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:34,000
While there are a lot of things about the
past we know, there are way more things we

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,660
know we don’t know.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,590
And worse, there are probably even more things
we don’t even know that we don’t know

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:50,330
about.

11
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,980
Think of the wonder of life: We now recognize
about 1.5 million eukaryotic species but there

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,660
may be as many as 10 million alive today.

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,760
And although we are adding some 15,000 new
species to our collective knowledge each year,

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,660
the vast majority of life on earth is still
undiscovered.

15
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,700
This is just what is around today.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,260
An estimated four billion species emerged
on our planet in past eons.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,770
But at least 99% of them died out, way before
humans spoke the first words.

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,500
The vast majority of all the different species
that ever existed are so utterly deleted that

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,890
they have become part of the “unknown unknown”
part of the past, lost to us forever.

20
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,950
Or are they?

21
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,700
Could we use science and imagination to glimpse
a shadow of the unreachable past?

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,460
Let us start with what we DO know.

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,410
To learn about creatures of the past we need
fossils, any sort of remains preserved from

24
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:00,210
past geological ages – bones or shells,
impressions or imprints, things preserved

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,000
in amber.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,810
The totality of all fossils on earth is called
the fossil record and it is the most important

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,899
window on the past we’ll ever have.

28
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,840
For a dead animal to fossilize a number of
things must go just right: The right environment,

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
timing and conditions.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,319
And then the fossil needs to survive for millions
or hundreds of millions of years and then

31
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,090
get back to the surface – and then be discovered
before natural processes dissolve it.

32
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,409
So it is kind of a miracle that we have what
we have and know what we know.

33
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,819
Take the dinosaurs since they were one of
the largest and most successful groups of

34
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:44,800
animals for some 165 million years – and
are also a lot of fun to animate.

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,530
What were they really like and what are we
missing?

36
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,010
In the last 200 years we’ve found tens of
thousands of fossils from over 1000 dinosaur

37
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,010
species..

38
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,129
Lately we’ve entered a golden era of discovery
and about 50 new dinosaur species are discovered

39
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:05,020
each year, expanding what we know and what
we know that we don’t know about them, which

40
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,020
is amazing.

41
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,700
But it also makes us aware of all the things
lost to the past forever.

42
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,049
Imagine if we took all the animals that lived
in the last 50 million years and randomly

43
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,480
chose 10000 individuals from 1000 species
to fossilize.

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,250
Think about all the things that would be missed,
or that seem too weird to be true.

45
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,689
Like the Giraffe, a yellow animal with brown
patterns that looks like a horse and an antelope

46
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,999
had a baby, with a long neck and two tiny
hairy horns.

47
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:38,430
How many “dinosaur giraffes” were there?

48
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,980
Animals so weird and selected for ecological
niches so specific that evolution molded their

49
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,129
bodies very absurdly - today they might seem
made up to us..

50
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:54,200
We know a lot of species are lost forever
just because of the environment they lived

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
in.

52
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,980
For example, lush jungles basically prevent
fossilization as the chances that an animal

53
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,499
will be buried here is minimal.

54
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:07,319
Countless scavengers of all sizes break down
freshly deceased animals extremely quickly

55
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,310
and the soil is often so acidic that bones
are dissolved.

56
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,160
And so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles are
practically nonexistent.

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,220
Today half of all known species live in the
few remaining rainforests that only cover

58
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,070
2% of earth's landmass.

59
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,840
Millions of years ago when dinosaurs roamed
earth, jungles covered much more of the planet.

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,730
So besides some insects and other small animals
trapped in amber, there should be millions

61
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,370
of species that emerged and vanished, without
leaving any trace.

62
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,130
Trapped deep inside the unknown, unknown.

63
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,080
But just in general biology trips us up.

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Look at your body.

65
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,060
It’s mainly squishy, gooey, soft stuff.

66
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,670
Which does not preserve well.

67
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:57,130
What remains the longest are the crystalized
parts of your bones and so most dinosaur fossils

68
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,590
are bones or teeth – usually fragments,
not entire skeletons.

69
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,470
This means that almost all boneless or shell-less
animals are practically wiped from the fossil

70
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,780
record.

71
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,500
If we take a look at the stunning diversity
of weird animals like worms, jellyfish and

72
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,940
slugs alive today we can only speculate what
we are missing.

73
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,000
Although thankfully many mostly soft and gooey
species also left us an incredible diversity

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,150
of shells that tell us an amazing amount about
our past, so at least we have that.

75
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,870
Still when we think about all the boneless
species that may have existed in the last

76
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,400
half billion years even our best attempt at
imagining them falls short.

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,770
But it's not like reimagining something based
on its bones is straightforward and so the

78
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,640
way we envisage what dinosaurs actually looked
like has changed a lot in the last few years.

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,090
In the past many illustrations had a bony,
minimalistic look, with a toothy grin to signify

80
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,420
fierceness and danger.

81
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,090
But if we draw today's animals in a similar
way, based on their skeletons, just for the

82
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,100
fun of it, we get the most bizarre creatures.

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,550
Elephants, swans and baboons that look like
monsters right out of nightmares.

84
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,040
So similar to animals today, we should imagine
dinosaurs with much more soft tissue, fat

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,070
bellies or chests, weird soft parts like skin
flaps, lips and gums and just more pronounced

86
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,530
features that would make them seem like much
more pleasant fellows.

87
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,980
Some soft features actually leave distinctive
traces on bones that we can look for in the

88
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,950
skeletons of extinct animals, which is where
today’s animals with similar features are

89
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,140
really helpful.

90
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,690
It’s a similar story with color.

91
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,400
Because we know what the feathers of living
birds look like, modern technology combined

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,060
with the exceedingly rare fossils with preserved
remains of fuzzy feathers give us a glimpse

93
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,690
of the real colors of extinct dinosaurs.

94
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:58,170
We know that tiny Sinosauropteryx had a striped
tail and its tiny dino buddy Anchiornis huxleyi

95
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,260
was white and black with gorgeous red feathers
around its head.

96
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,590
Still, for the vast majority of really any
ancient extinct species we have no real clue

97
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,520
what color they were.

98
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,920
But we know what modern dinosaurs, birds,
look like and here we find the most amazing

99
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,690
variety.

100
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,870
So some dinosaurs will have tried to blend
into the background, while others might have

101
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,870
fielded aggressive color schemes to attract
mates or to appear dangerous.

102
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,680
Some might have had impressive decorations
or colorful beaks.

103
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,770
Some may have been striped or patterned.

104
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,930
Similarly we don’t know that much about
dinosaur behaviour, although once again we

105
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,590
can draw conclusions from existing animals.

106
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,720
For example even apex predators like lions
spend a lot of their time lying around and

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,810
cuddling and licking each other and playing.

108
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,810
Why would dinosaurs be so different?

109
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,720
When we first found the skull of T. rex with
its mighty teeth and probably the strongest

110
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,060
bite of any land animal ever, we imagined
a fierce and stupid beast.

111
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,620
But modern scanning technology has revealed
that T.rex had a larger brain-to-body ratio

112
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,400
than some earlier giant meat-eaters.

113
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,940
And it probably had very sharp hearing, vision
and sense of smell and was in all likelihood

114
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,370
not a stupid animal.

115
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,170
So maybe T.rex was a cuddly fellow that spent
a lot of time playing around or impressing

116
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,020
potential mates when it was not hungry.

117
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,670
Likewise, while their horns and shields might
have made ceratopsids appear to be natural

118
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,500
born fighters, they were probably much more
than that.

119
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,330
Based on the behaviour of modern animals and
the complex dances some have to go through

120
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,129
to mate, maybe their shields were amazingly
colorful, maybe it danced for its mates like

121
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,380
many birds do today.

122
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,660
How intensely amazing these creatures must
have been.

123
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,800
And what a loss it is to us that we don’t
get to experience them first hand.

124
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,000
What an even greater loss that there is so
much we will never know about them and even

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,060
more tragic, all the absurd and beautiful
beings that disappeared without a trace.

126
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,810
But such is life – time marches on without
any concern for our feelings and the past

127
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,310
expands with every moment that passes.

128
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,620
Most wild animals alive today will in all
likelihood not leave fossils behind and also

129
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,410
just disappear forever.

130
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,449
We can do something about that though – instead
of accelerating the extinction we are witnessing

131
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:28,999
we could become the guardians of life and
preserve it where we find it.

132
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:34,870
If possible in the wild, if not then in museums,
movies and in our minds.

133
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,470
Because as amazing as our imagination is,
and as fascinating to think about the animals

134
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,510
that are part of the unknown unknown – it
is even better to witness them in the present.

135
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:54,670
The land that we actually inhabit, where we
get to experience life as it happens.

136
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,940
There is one more exciting way to experience
Dinosaurs though this year: The 12,022 Human

137
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,699
Era Calendar: Eons Edition.

138
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:07,820
As always, we’re adding 10,000 years to
the regular calendar to represent the Human

139
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,860
Era and include all cultures around the world.

140
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,570
But this year we’re expanding the scope
beyond humanity to showcase forgotten animals

141
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,870
and plants from all across the Phanerozoic
Eon, like giant armoured fish, scythe lizards

142
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,990
or giant sloths, on 12 elaborate pages.

143
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,949
Witness how multicellular life has persisted
for over half a billion years, surviving asteroid

144
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:32,870
impacts, volcanoes and frozen oceans.

145
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,050
And of course, pandemics.

146
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:41,730
In the end life, uh, finds a way – and we
want to celebrate that!

147
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,310
You can get the very shiny, high-quality,
limited Edition now until we sell out and

148
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,889
then never again.

149
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:51,800
To support what we do on this channel, to
fill the void in your soul or just to have

150
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,200
something beautiful to look at.

151
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,940
As every year, we also have bundles and special
calendar deals with some of your favorite

152
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,300
products.

153
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,889
Thank you so much to all of the thousands
of birbs who get the calendar every year,

154
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:11,540
you enable us to create videos and to publish
them for free, for everyone.

155
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:27,660
We wish you a happy year 12,022.
