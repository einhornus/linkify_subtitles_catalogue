00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,559
Until recently, the vast majority of the world population worked on farms

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,939
and the total production of the world's economy

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,299
was mostly the total agricultural output.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,979
And this output was limited by the fixed size of the land.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,019
The total output of the economy did not change a lot year by year.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,859
The size of the pie was fixed; the world was a zero-sum game.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:31,659
In such a stagnating world,  the only way to get better off is if someone else gets worse off.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,079
if you take a bigger piece of the pie, someone else's gets smaller.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,599
If you want more food, then conquering, plundering, and stealing are great strategies.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,959
Your neighbors loss is your gain.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,999
This was the state of things for thousands of years.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,039
Societies invaded each other constantly to get more pie.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,499
Economic inequality was extreme.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,899
Some had all the pie they wanted, while others had to live with the crumbs.

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,539
Then, the Industrial Revolution happened and everything changed.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,779
We developed machinery, better crops, better fertilizers.

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:17,119
Agricultural output skyrocketed, but we didn't just produce more food - every industrial sector exploded in terms of productivity.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,479
From 1700 to 1870, the production of iron in Britain increased 137 fold.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,819
The Industrial Revolution led to a previously unimaginable increase in economic output.

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,079
This altered the nature of our societies.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,959
Economic growth changed the world from a zero-sum game to a positive-sum game.

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,439
We had found a way to create a bigger pie - but not only a bigger pie, but a pie that was growing bigger each year.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,499
More people could have more at the same time.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,499
This development is spreading and continuing today.

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,359
Antibiotics kill bacteria.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,139
Power plants deliver energy.

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,719
Cell phones connect us.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,539
Planes let us travel cheaply.

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,139
Fridges store food.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,599
Continuous progress in all sectors of the economy seems normal to us today,

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,619
but the change from stagnation to economic growth really was the most drastic shift in human history.

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,439
How was this possible?

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,639
At the very core of this massive transformation stand new ideas that lead to innovation.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,339
Innovation has many different definitions,

35
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,799
but in the context of this video, we mean better solutions to existing problems

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,599
and solutions to problems we didn't know we had.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,959
The more you innovate,

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,279
the more complex and interesting problems you discover as your wishes and needs evolve.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,359
The average citizen in Norway 250 years ago might have wanted some really good shoes.

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,999
150 years ago, maybe a bicycle.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,899
80 years ago, a car.

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,959
30 years ago, cheap air travel. And so on.

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,619
Once we get what we want, we don't stop;

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,539
we can see how we can improve things even more, and how to make things even better.

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,879
The new positive-sum world has existed for 0.1% of human history and we have yet to get used to it.

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,559
It has a consequence that feels really unintuitive.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,579
In a positive-sum world,

48
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,979
it's in your personal selfish best interest that every human on planet earth is well off.

49
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,039
It's good for you if people in obscure parts of countries you've never heard of are prospering.

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,659
There is a genuine selfish argument for making the world a better place.

51
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,159
In a positive-sum world, the more people are well-off, the better your own life is.

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,779
This is because of the nature of innovation;

53
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,479
it is fundamentally driven by supply and demand.

54
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,299
The supply increases when more people have the freedom and education to contribute.

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,699
They become inventors, researchers, engineers or thinkers that come up with new ideas.

56
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,379
The demand for ideas increases as people get richer, and can pay for new solutions.

57
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,079
They increase the size of the market for innovations.

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,739
Innovation follows incentives.

59
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:18,979
So naturally, if many people want and can pay for something, it will get the innovators attention and energy.

60
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,319
Improving the lives of those who are worst off has a multiplying effect.

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,999
It increases demand for ideas while at the same time,

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,299
making it easier for ideas to be produced.

63
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,939
Let's take an example that interests all of us - a cure for cancer.

64
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,999
If there are 1 billion people in the world that have the wealth to pay for cancer treatments,

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,339
innovation will follow this demand.

66
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,279
So hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in medical research.

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,099
This had a huge effect, but we're still nowhere near to curing all forms of cancer.

68
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,259
Today, every sixth person in the world dies of cancer, and you might be one of them.

69
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,099
Now, imagine if demand were higher.

70
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,719
Imagine instead of 1 billion people being able to pay for a cure for cancer, there were 4 billion or 7 billion.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,999
Imagine how far medicine could have developed if we'd invested 7 times as much in curing cancer.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,639
On top of that, there's so much human potential being wasted right now.

73
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,019
The work of a poor farmer in a developing nation is not useful to you.

74
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,859
But if he becomes better off, his children might spend their time in university

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,559
developing things that are useful to you.

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,479
Instead of having some hotspots of innovation in the developed world,

77
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,699
we would have many hotspots all over the world.

78
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,219
The research output of humanity would be many times what it is right now.

79
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,319
Could we have cured cancer by now if that were the case?

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,399
Well, maybe.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,619
If we spent 7 times as much on research, had 7 times as many people working on it,

82
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,139
and a global network of medical research, things would certainly be further ahead than they are now.

83
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,539
And this is the core of the argument:

84
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,019
the more people want the same thing that you want,

85
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,539
the more likely you are to get it.

86
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,559
That is what it means to live in a positive-sum world.

87
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,039
You don't gain more pie if poor places stay poor.

88
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,659
Instead, you get more pie if poor places get richer, contribute ideas, and grow the global pie.

89
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,839
Do you like space travel?

90
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,079
Imagine there were billions of people in Africa and Asia with their own space programs,

91
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,439
and demand for satellites and moon bases and cities on Mars.

92
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,179
Do you like being alive?

93
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,459
A few billion people paying for medical research could literally save your life.

94
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,839
It's in your interest for people around the world to become better off.

95
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,099
The faster we get to this version of the world, the better for you personally.

96
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,899
No matter what your motivation is, working on a better world is a very good thing to do -

97
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,939
for others, and for you.
