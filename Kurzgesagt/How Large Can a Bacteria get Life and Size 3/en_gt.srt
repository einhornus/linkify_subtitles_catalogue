1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,629
In and out, in and out.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:14,558
Staying alive is about doing things.  At this point, your cells burn glucose molecules with oxygen

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,129
to make energy available, keeping you alive for another precious moment.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,665
To get the oxygen to your cells, you breathe.

5
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:30,979
Breathing is an answer to a very difficult problem: how do you get the resources your cells need to survive,

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,308
from the outside in your cells?  Every living thing has to solve this problem,

7
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:44,158
and the solution is surprisingly different, depending on one of life's most important regulators:

8
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,158
size.

9
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,439
As we've discussed in other videos:

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,409
At different scales, the physical laws of the universe affect its inhabitants differently.

11
00:00:53,410 --> 00:01:00,062
Simple things like temperature, microgravity, or surface tension may not matter to you or pose a deadly hazard

12
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:02,709
— depending on how tall you are.

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,169
Living things need many different materials to stay alive.

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,071
And they have to somehow transport them from the outside in.

15
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:19,055
This was a huge problem for the first things that were about to come to life, because doing anything in our universe requires energy.

16
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:24,754
And the first living things on Earth did not have the abundance of tools and techniques

17
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:27,519
that life has today after billions of years of evolution.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,949
So in the very beginning, life had to find a way to get good things inside

19
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,979
and bad things outside of itself without using energy.

20
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,539
Fortunately, the very first life forms were very small.

21
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,619
And because they were so small, they were able to use a free form of

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,562
transportation based on a law of physics called diffusion.

23
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:57,760
Diffusion is the rule of the universe that molecules, especially in liquids or gases, are

24
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:01,280
constantly moving in all directions.

25
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:07,065
And because they move and collide with each other and other molecules, they tend to disperse.

26
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:12,774
For example, if you drop a sugar cube in water, there will be a lot of

27
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:15,773
sugar in one place and not in another.

28
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:21,479
When sugar molecules dissolve in the water, they will randomly collide with the water molecules

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,358
and other sugar molecules.

30
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:30,241
Slowly, all the sugar molecules will disperse and form multiple phases with different concentrations.

31
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:35,798
These random movements continue endlessly, until at some point the sugar

32
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:37,818
is evenly distributed in the water.

33
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:44,009
The beauty of diffusion is that life can use it for free, it doesn't require any energy.

34
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,850
And life likes free things.  All life on Earth is therefore dependent on distribution.

35
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:58,497
Let's take a look at the smallest living thing on Earth, a bacterium.  Specific are surfaces.

36
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:02,458
Cell membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules.

37
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,248
This particular bacterium consumes oxygen to live, while inside it produces carbon dioxide

38
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:10,233
as a waste product.

39
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:16,466
So there is not much oxygen in the bacterium, but a lot of carbon dioxide.

40
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:22,929
Through diffusion, these molecules will eventually spread evenly, causing the carbon dioxide to diffuse,

41
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,708
while oxygen is constantly replenished from the outside.

42
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,958
But this kind of 'breathing' only works for the very small world.

43
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,272
For bacteria, amoebae or your cells and some very small animals.

44
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:41,979
For example, insects have a fine network of trachea, tunnels with a pressure gradient,

45
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,339
into which air can diffuse very slowly and exchange gases with the insect cells.

46
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,208
But even insects seem to be able to contract their windpipes,

47
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:57,098
and some even have specialized respiratory organs such as spiracles and air sacs.

48
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:02,751
At certain scales, diffusion is simply too slow to keep cells alive.

49
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:08,589
The fundamental problem is that the exchange with the environment can only take place on the surface

50
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,999
and diffusion of materials can only support a certain amount inside.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,549
Small living beings have only a little on the inside, or volume, and a lot on the outside,

52
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,833
or surface.

53
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:28,223
But what if we wanted to make a bacterium the size of a blue whale

54
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:32,096
and had a very handy magnifying machine?

55
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,729
We would unfortunately be confused by the square cube law.

56
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,539
In a nutshell, it means that if you make something ten times bigger,

57
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:48,859
the outside or the surface will be 100 times bigger, but the inside or the volume will be 1000 times bigger.

58
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,309
If we compare the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a blue whale,

59
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:00,629
we see that the bacterium has 10,000,000 times more surface area than the whale in relation to its volume.

60
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,633
The bacteria has a lot of outside, while the whale has a lot of inside.

61
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:12,092
If we make a bacterium the size of a whale - our giant bacterium now has too much inside

62
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:15,869
and most of the inside is now far from the surface.

63
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,885
The oxygen our bacteria needs will never reach the inside until the oxygen runs out.

64
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:29,429
Our giant bacteria would just die.  However, being bigger has many advantages.

65
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,929
From making it harder to eat to making it easier to eat others.

66
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,269
But the size of cells is limited by the distance that oxygen and nutrients can effectively disperse

67
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,503
to supply enough resources inside.

68
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:48,989
So life avoided this problem by forming multicellular structures —

69
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,949
creatures composed of many cells instead of one.

70
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,549
Because diffusion works better if you have many small units rather than one much larger one.

71
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,877
Over time, the cell mates began to share work and specialize.

72
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:11,979
Some cells focused on feeling the environment, others on digestion, others on movement.

73
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,049
But that wasn't enough.

74
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,090
The problem of diffusion and surface and energy production remained,

75
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:22,779
limiting the size of these first multicellular life forms.

76
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,339
So to get even bigger,

77
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:32,153
life solved the diffusion problem by having holes, caves and tunnels and by folding itself in

78
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:36,423
so that diffusion could easily take place in each of the cells.

79
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:43,997
Take yourself: what you consider to be your outside, your skin, has an area of about 2 square meters.  But 

80
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:48,769
your lungs have an area of about 70 square meter

81
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,373
.  They're not like balloons, they're more like sponges filled with lots of tightly packed little balloons,

82
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,749
surrounded by blood vessels.

83
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,659
When you inhale, all these little balloons fill with fresh air.

84
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,659
Blood filled with CO2 is pumped around the balloons.

85
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,319
And then the magic of diffusion happens.

86
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,309
The oxygen diffuses into the blood where it is absorbed by red blood cells.

87
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,019
And the CO2 diffuses out of the blood and into your lungs, where it can be exhaled again.

88
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,839
Your blood then carries oxygenated blood to the farthest corners of your body

89
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,432
and absorbs the CO2 waste.

90
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:32,399
Diffusion in the body is effective from about one millimeter,

91
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,179
so each cell in your body is a maximum of one millimeter away from a blood vessel.

92
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,487
So medium-sized animals like you need a lot of blood vessels to reach every cell in the body.

93
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:49,279
Your body alone has about 100,000 kilometers of capillaries,

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,558
the smallest of your blood vessels, covering an area of about 1,000 square meter

95
00:07:55,559 --> 00:08:00,989
.  This applies to all parts of you that want to exchange something with the outside world.

96
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,429
Your body needs surfaces to absorb nutrients from your food,

97
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,309
so your gut is the size of half a badminton court, about 40 square meters.

98
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,449
The bigger you are, the more hidden surfaces you need.

99
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,249
Grab a tree.  The way to stay alive is to make sugar out of thin air and sunlight.

100
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,929
So it needs as much surface area as possible.

101
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,779
An orange tree with two thousand leaves has a leaf area of 200 square meters.  But 

102
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:36,069
the area in the leaves where diffusion actually takes place is 6000 square meters.

103
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,509
The same goes for roots, where water diffuses from the soil into countless tiny hairs that

104
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,298
maximize surface area.

105
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:50,456
The roots of one square meter of grass together form about 350 square meters of surface!

106
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:57,544
When we look at the breathtaking diversity of life on this planet, it seems like everything is quite different.

107
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:59,668
And it is.

108
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:07,772
But some basics are the same for everyone and haven't changed significantly for billions of years,

109
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:11,636
if we look at the very small or the very big:

110
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:21,529
waste goes out and fresh fuel comes in.  Big animals just need a lot of complexity.  sanitary to make it possible.

111
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:27,469
Fresh fuel is something we can all use from time to time, especially for our creativity.

112
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:33,479
All it takes is to try something new and we have the perfect opportunity to get you started:
