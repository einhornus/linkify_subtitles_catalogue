1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,199
When our vegetarian ancestors started
eating meat around two million years ago,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,599
it wasn’t just because animals taste great,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,819
it was pure necessity.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:17,459
Climate change made many of the plants our ancestors
relied on less available, and meat bridged that gap.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,539
From the discovery of fire at the latest,
meat became a staple of the human diet.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,779
But over the last few years, eating meat has increasingly
been associated with health risks like:

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,299
heart disease, certain cancers and an early death.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:46,459
So how unhealthy is meat, really?

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,059
In this video, we’ll only talk about meat.

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,319
Dairy products deserve a video of their own.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,919
Biologically, we need to eat for three reasons:

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,639
for energy, to acquire materials to fabricate our cells,

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,699
and to get special molecules that our
bodies can’t make themselves.

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:10,439
The energy and most of the materials come from the
three macronutrients: fats, carbohydrates and proteins.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,199
Proteins are the most important resource for
repairing and replenishing our cell structures.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,179
The special molecules are a large variety of vitamins
and minerals we need to drive metabolic processes.

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,099
Meat provides us with most of these things.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,939
It contains all essential amino acids our
body needs, and a lot of minerals like:

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:38,239
iron, zinc and essential vitamins – some of which
are barely found in plants, like Vitamin B12.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,859
Only one essential nutrient is missing in
most of the meat we consume: Vitamin C.

21
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,859
It appears in almost all plants and supports our immune system,

22
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,779
as well as the development of connective tissues.

23
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,799
After a few months without it, you’d get scurvy.

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,559
But meat has another big advantage: its high bioavailability.

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,339
Some of the nutrients in meat are broken down faster,
and available quicker than those from plants.

26
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,879
Spinach, for example, contains more iron
than meat, but it’s absorbed much slower

27
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,299
and the body needs more energy to digest it.

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,699
Several health benefits have also been observed
in communities that rely solely on meat.

29
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,639
The Inuit, for example, are able to survive in extreme
climate conditions, thanks to a purely meat-based diet.

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,999
Since they consume the whole animal including the
organs, they get every single nutrient they need,

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,559
including Vitamin C.

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,059
So meat itself is definitely not dangerous for us,

33
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,699
but its health effects vary depending on how it’s
prepared and what animal it comes from.

34
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,159
When talking about meat in the Western world,

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,979
we generally mean muscle tissues that have a high nutrient density,

36
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,999
but also lack some of the vitamins that
make it possible to survive on meat alone.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,999
The most healthy animals to eat are probably fish.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,859
Fish contains polyunsaturated fatty acids like ω-3,

39
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,219
which may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and
support anti-inflammatory immune functions.

40
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,759
As part of a balanced diet, fish can be eaten regularly without worries.

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,359
Eating fish comes with its own bag of complications though,

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,599
like overfishing and the destruction of the oceans.

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,539
We’ll talk about that in another video.

44
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,779
A close second is the most popular meat: chicken.

45
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,239
It’s regarded as the meat with the fewest health risks.

46
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,019
The only negative health effect of poultry is a bit controversial:

47
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,419
fat.

48
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,759
Its high content of saturated fats is associated with a
higher cholesterol level and cardiovascular disease.

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,819
But this idea has also been criticised by a large number of scientists

50
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,199
arguing high cholesterol levels might be inherited and not caused by nutrition.

51
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,919
So, in general, if you want meat and are
concerned about your health, go for chicken.

52
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:08,679
Things start to get problematic with high intakes of
red meats like beef, veal, pork, lamb, horse and goat.

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,519
A recently published study recommends, for example,
a maximum of twenty-three grams of red meat per day,

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,719
which is a very small steak per week.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,739
However, large-scale meta-analysis studies have shown
that eating one hundred grams of red meat every day

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:33,719
increases the risk of diabetes by 19%, of strokes
by 11%, and of colorectal cancer by 17%.

57
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,179
This sounds alarming. But before we panic, let’s
have a look at how these studies were conducted,

58
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,279
because this brings us to the second big problem
when trying to answer the question of

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,879
whether meat is unhealthy or not.

60
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,899
Most studies that linked health risks to
eating red meat were case-control studies,

61
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,739
which means taking a group of people with a disease
and classifying them by their eating habits.

62
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,679
The more red meat they consume, the more
likely they were to contract certain diseases.

63
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,519
The problem is that it’s very hard to eliminate other factors.

64
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,179
People who eat less meat tend to
live a healthier lifestyle in general.

65
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,999
They tend to eat more vegetables and fruit,
and are less likely to smoke and drink alcohol.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,599
Most studies try to eliminate these factors, but it’s
extremely hard to make definitive statements.

67
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,739
Things get worse when we look at processed meat, though.

68
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,499
Processing meat means adding certain chemicals by

69
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,439
curing, smoking, sorting or fermenting.

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,239
Or in other words, making it delicious.

71
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,819
Bacon, ham, salami, sausages and hot dogs
contain chemicals that are harmful for us,

72
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,479
like nitrates and nitrites that can damage the DNA
in our digestive system and lead to cancer.

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,979
The WHO reviewed eight hundred studies over twenty years,

74
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,659
and concluded that processed meat is strongly
linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

75
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:04,279
Each extra fifty grams of processed meat
per day increases your risk of cancer by 18%.

76
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,419
When it comes to cancer risk, processed meat
is now in the same category as plutonium,

77
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,179
asbestos and smoking.

78
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,139
The WHO highlights that its research is only
about the question of whether or not something

79
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,699
causes cancer, and not to what extent.

80
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,539
But processed meat may also significantly
increase the chance of suffering from

81
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,679
diabetes, strokes and coronary heart diseases.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,039
It also makes a difference what sort of life our
meat lived when it was still part of a living being.

83
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,539
It’s common to feed large amounts of antibiotics to livestock

84
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,699
in order to prevent diseases, which can spread antibiotic resistance.

85
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,659
Combined, a high consumption of both red and processed meat

86
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,279
could increase your chance of premature death by up to 29%.

87
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,899
This means if your chance of dying is at 3% this year, it’s now 4%.

88
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,339
This might not sound like a lot, but tiny percentages
have a huge impact on societies of millions.

89
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,299
They also seem harmless until they affect you.

90
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,599
To blame meat alone for bad health would be wrong, though.

91
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,119
There is no evidence that the very essence of meat 
has any negative effect beyond its high fat content.

92
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,459
And even this point is highly contentious.

93
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,779
Just like with many other pleasures in life,
sometimes too much of a good thing is harmful.

94
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,879
Most public health agencies suggest cutting meat
consumption to five hundred grams a week,

95
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,759
while studies suggest cutting down
processed meat as much as possible.

96
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,039
So if you feast on meat no more than once
or twice a week, you should be good.

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,559
For most people, this already means
a drastic change in their diets, though.

98
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,939
The average American consumes around almost one
thousand and six hundred grams of meat a week.

99
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,479
The average German one thousand and one hundred a week.

100
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,559
And many of us eat much, much more.

101
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,519
If you’re not really sure, make a small note
whenever you eat meat for a week or two.

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,339
You’ll be surprised how much it really is.

103
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,599
So most people watching this video would
benefit from cutting down on meat.

104
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,419
Aside from health concerns,

105
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,739
there’s still the fact that the meat industry is one
of the largest contributors to climate change,

106
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,119
and has reached a scale where it’s impossible
to deliver millions of tonnes of meat

107
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,759
and still treat animals with dignity.

108
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,719
We’ve already discussed that in detail in another video.

109
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,839
All in all, in moderation, meat is not unhealthy and
you don’t need to become vegetarian overnight

110
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,279
to have a real impact on your health and the planet.

111
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,918
But your lifestyle choices do matter,

112
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,359
for yourself and for others.

113
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,459
They key is being open to trying something new once in a while.

114
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,039
Maybe you’ll discover your new favourite dish.

115
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,379
Until you try, you’ll never know what you’ll enjoy or what you’re capable of.

116
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,819
Maybe after watching hours of Kurzgesagt videos,
you decided you’d like to learn how to animate.

117
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,939
Now you might not know this, but most of our
team actually has a graphic design background.

118
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,839
Learning about design principles first before we go into
animation today was really key to where we are today.

119
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,239
There’s a really great new Skillshare class on using Adobe Illustrator,

120
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,199
the software we use to create artwork,
by graphic designer Aaron Draplin,

121
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,979
and we can personally recommend it.

122
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,639
It’s full of great tips to help understand
and simplify a very complicated program.

123
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,779
If you want to do more afterwards, we have these
animation courses of our own on Skillshare, too.

124
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,059
Skillshare offers over twenty-five thousand classes on topics

125
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,979
like film and video editing, writing, design, and
technology, from an array of skilled experts.

126
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,399
With the Premium Membership, you can access
all of them for only ten dollars a month.

127
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,359
And, as a bonus, the first one thousand Kurzgesagt
