1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,239
Black holes are the largest collections
of pure, violent energy in the Universe.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,299
If you come too close, they’ll devour you
and add your energy to their collection.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,419
And so, the energy is lost to us forever.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,639
Or is it? It turns out there’s a Universe cheat code.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,639
A way of powering civilisations until the very death of everything,
or of constructing the largest bomb in the Universe.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,719
But how?

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,499
Didn’t we learn that all energy is trapped
forever in black holes, even light?

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,839
This is true.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,239
Everything you think you know about the weirdest thing in
the Universe is about to get weirder, for one simple reason:

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:57,279
Black holes are spinning.

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,579
When really, really massive stars die, their cores
collapse under their own gravity into black holes.

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:11,039
This means something very big becomes very, very tiny.
Like the tiniest anything can be in this universe.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,659
But stars are rotating, and a fundamental property of our universe
is that things that are spinning don’t want to stop spinning.

14
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,159
We call this angular momentum,

15
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:29,259
and this angular momentum can’t go away. A big
thing that spins and becomes smaller spins faster.

16
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:38,339
So, as the core of a star collapses, its momentum makes it spin
faster and faster and faster until it collapses into a black hole.

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,799
And the black hole keeps on spinning inconceivably fast.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:50,259
Some of them spin millions of times a second.

19
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,459
Just like non-spinning black holes,

20
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:59,419
spinning black holes have an event horizon, and a singularity
at their core where all of their mass is concentrated.

21
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,579
The singularity is usually described as a single
infinitely small point with no surface area.

22
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,139
But points can’t rotate, so a rotating singularity can’t be a point.

23
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,799
Instead, it’s a “ring-ularity”.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,879
A ringularity is a ring with a thickness of zero and no surface,
spinning extremely fast, containing all the mass of the black hole.

25
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,759
The black hole is spinning so fast that it morphs space and time itself.

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,739
It literally drags space with it, such is its power.

27
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:39,839
This creates a new and super weird region of spacetime,
the ergosphere, which envelops the black hole.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,699
If space and time are completely broken inside the event
horizon, then they’re only half-broken inside the ergosphere.

29
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,679
Inside the ergosphere, nothing makes sense.

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,799
It’s possible to enter it and then leave it again,
but it’s probably not a great experience.

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,819
You can imagine it like this: falling into a
static black hole is like sliding down a hole.

32
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,979
Being inside the ergosphere of a spinning
black hole is like spiralling down a deadly drain.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,199
The black hole transfers its own kinetic energy in the
form of rotation, to everything that enters the ergosphere.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,139
The ringularity makes you dance whether you want to or not.

35
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,339
You need to move faster than the speed of light
just to stand still here, which is impossible.

36
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:36,279
But here’s our cheat code: we can steal this
energy, and there’s a lot of energy to steal.

37
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,439
Take the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.

38
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,439
We could steal as much energy from it as every single
star in the Milky Way emits in a billion years, combined.

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,759
The easiest way to steal this energy is, oddly
enough, to drop something into the black hole.

40
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,139
We’ve seen that the ringularity forces
energy on us when we enter the ergosphere,

41
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,199
which is a lot like being in a whirlpool with
spacetime rushing around and around.

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,579
If you’re clever, you can use the water to
your advantage and swim faster than before.

43
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,559
In practise, this means sending a rocket into the
ergosphere and making a trade with the black hole:

44
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,559
We give it some mass-energy, and it gives us some of its rotational energy.

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,479
But it’s not a fair trade. We get the better deal.

46
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,959
Normally, if you fire a rocket you exchange
chemical energy for kinetic energy.

47
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,759
This is like pushing yourself forward in a swimming pool.

48
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,439
But if you fire a rocket inside the ergosphere,
it’s like pushing yourself forward in a wave pool.

49
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,319
The rotational energy of the waves gives you a much
stronger boost than you could get just by pushing yourself.

50
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,059
The boost from the rotation of the black hole is so big that you
leave the ergosphere with much more energy than you entered it.

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,679
The black hole gives a tiny amount of its
rotational energy to you and slows down a little.

52
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,279
Obviously, this requires a lot of food.

53
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,839
Fortunately, black holes aren’t picky eaters.

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:14,259
An advanced future civilisation would probably harvest asteroids
to drop them into the black hole when they needed an energy boost.

55
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:26,859
But there’s an even better way to get energy from a black hole, and oddly
enough, it builds the biggest bomb any living thing could every hope to build.

56
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,859
We only need two things to build a black hole
bomb: a fast spinning black hole and a big mirror.

57
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,619
The mirror has to completely envelop the black hole,

58
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,359
which is similar to a Dyson Sphere – a megastructure
that harvests the energy of an entire star.

59
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,979
Although, our mirror would be easier to build.

60
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,319
Mirrors are simpler, and black holes are
much, much more compact than stars.

61
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,699
If we made the mirror ten centimetres thick, the metal of a big asteroid would
probably be enough material for a black hole with the mass of our Sun.

62
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:06,039
Once our mirror is in place, we only need to open a window
and shoot electromagnetic waves at the black hole.

63
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,679
You can imagine what happens next by imagining tossing
a ball at a wall, and it coming back faster than a bullet.

64
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,379
The waves hit the black hole at lightspeed.

65
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,499
A small proportion of the waves falls past
the event horizon to disappear forever.

66
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,939
But a much larger amount sloshes through the ergosphere,

67
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,139
where the black hole forces some of its
rotational energy on them and amplifies them.

68
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,419
They now begin superradiant scattering,
which are fancy science words meaning

69
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,359
“bouncing around between mirror and black hole and getting stronger”.

70
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,479
Every time they go around, they are getting exponentially stronger.

71
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,459
By opening some windows in the mirror, we can extract
the energy from the waves as fast as they grow.

72
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:57,159
Which we could use, in theory, to create, what would be for all practical
purposes, an endless source of energy for trillions of years.

73
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,379
Or, we could blow it up.

74
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,919
If the waves are not released, they will
continue to get stronger and stronger,

75
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,339
and take more and more energy from
the black hole until the mirror shatters.

76
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,539
A supermassive black hole would release as much energy as a supernova,

77
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:21,639
making the bomb the largest explosion any living being could ever create.

78
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,859
The beauty of the black hole bomb, the Penrose process
and the superradiant scattering, is that they are not science fiction.

79
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,639
In the far, far future, this might be the
only way to survive in our dying universe.

80
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:43,319
After all the red dwarfs have cooled down and all the white dwarfs
transformed into black dwarfs, the Universe will turn dark forever.

81
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:50,179
Rotating black holes might be the only sources of
energy in the entire Universe that life could harvest.

82
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:57,439
If so, the last living being in existence might
one day end its life around a black hole.

83
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,139
Which is equally chilling and uplifting.

84
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:08,039
It turns out that even without any light, there are places we can go.

85
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,479
Black holes are as interesting as they are mysterious,
but there’s actually a surprising amount we do know.

86
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,399
Using maths, we can calculate things and come up
with theories about how we die if we fall into them.

87
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,999
If you’re the sort of person who gets excited about
maths and calculating these things for yourself,

88
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,079
