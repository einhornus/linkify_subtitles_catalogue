1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
What if our universe

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,090
comes with a self-destruct button

3
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,093
to eliminate itself

4
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,491
so cleanly and efficiently,

5
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:08,343
that every single physical thing

6
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:09,798
would just stop existing

7
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:11,631
and life would be impossible

8
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:13,670
forever.

9
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:16,443
The ultimate ecological catastrophe -

10
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:17,943
vacuum decay.

11
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:27,362
(Theme music)

12
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:28,774
To explain how our universe

13
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:29,841
could destroy itself,

14
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:32,072
we need to understand two principles:

15
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:36,301
One - energy levels.

16
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,402
A core idea in physics is that

17
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,233
everything has an energy level.

18
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:43,343
The higher the level,
the more energy is in the system

19
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,131
Wood, for example, has a high level.

20
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:46,813
It can be burnt, a process that

21
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,674
releases the chemical energy 
stored in its molecular bonds

22
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,563
and turns it into heat.

23
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:53,384
The ash leftover is at a

24
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:56,703
lower energy level than the wood before.

25
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:58,933
Two - stability.

26
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,803
Everything in our universe tries to move

27
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:04,814
towards its ground state,
in which it's completely stable

28
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,192
and has as little energy as possible.

29
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:10,333
For example, a ball on a hill is unstable

30
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,690
and has a lot of potential energy.

31
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,975
When disturbed,
it will roll down into the valey

32
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:17,745
and lose its potential energy
in the process

33
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:20,571
The ball is now
in its ground state and stable.

34
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:22,444
It will remain like that.

35
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,252
Everything in our universe

36
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:25,912
follows these two principles.

37
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:28,022
If something has a lot of energy,

38
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:30,196
it's unstable and wants to get rid of it

39
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:30,961
to become stable

40
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,872
and reach its ground state.

41
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:35,467
This is true for every system

42
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:36,985
even in the weird world of

43
00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:39,333
quantum mechanics.

44
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:42,645
If our current understanding of physics
is correct, then the universe

45
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:44,844
gets its properties from quantum fields.

46
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:46,465
We explained them in detail

47
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,917
in another video.

48
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:49,223
For this video, imagine them

49
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:50,905
as the rules of the universe.

50
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,366
They tell particles how to

51
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,273
behave and interact

52
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:56,792
Like everything in the universe,

53
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:59,144
they want to be
in the lowest energy level possible,

54
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:01,507
which is called a vacuum state.

55
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:03,178
This has nothing to do with

56
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,455
vacuum in space.

57
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:05,797
It's just called this way

58
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:10,125
because scientists are bad at
naming things

59
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:11,964
We then call the fields reached their

60
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,625
vacuum state, except maybe one.

61
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:17,296
It's possible that the Higgs Field

62
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:20,143
is not stable, but metastable, which is

63
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:21,735
a fancy way of saying that it

64
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:24,756
pretends to be stable but really is not.

65
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:26,627
It would be a false vacuum.

66
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:29,106
The Higgs Field is responsible for

67
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,677
giving particles their mass,

68
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:32,406
which rules how almost everything

69
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:34,307
in the universe interacts.

70
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:37,558
What would happen if the Higgs Field
is a false vacuum?

71
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,442
Think of our ball in the valley:

72
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:42,324
the ball is the Higgs Field.

73
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:45,815
The valley might not be the
lowest energy state for the Higgs Field.

74
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,786
There might an even deeper valley
that it wants to get to.

75
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:51,397
This would mean that the Higgs Field
has a lot of potential energy,

76
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:53,206
waiting to be released.

77
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,924
The Higgs Field could be
like a piece of wood

78
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,377
but drenched in gasoline,

79
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,076
waiting to set the universe on fire.

80
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,779
A random spark like quantum tunneling

81
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,805
could release the potential energy

82
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:05,246
of the Higgs Fields.

83
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:06,787
This could happen at any time

84
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:08,287
and without warning.

85
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,906
If at any point in space,

86
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:12,006
this so-called vacuum decay starts,

87
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:14,074
there is no turning back.

88
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,958
As the Higgs Field crashes into

89
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,318
the lower energy state,

90
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,145
it releases a massive amount of

91
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:20,619
potential energy.

92
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,327
This energy pushes the space around it

93
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,726
over the barrier, which releases

94
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:25,676
more potential energy.

95
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,850
A sphere of the new stable Higgs Field,

96
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,508
or true vacuum, grows at the

97
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,496
speed of light in all directions.

98
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:35,100
Imagine it like setting a sea of gasoline,

99
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:37,636
the size of the universe, on fire.

100
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:39,267
This sphere is surrounded by

101
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:41,217
a shell of energy that devours everything

102
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:42,779
it comes into contact with.

103
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,838
Whatever it touches

104
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,990
is eliminated for existence.

105
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,397
The bubble will continue to grow forever.

106
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:51,436
deleting the universe on its way.

107
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:53,419
There is no way to be warned,

108
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,308
since it's so fast.

109
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:57,278
But there's nothing we can do anyway.

110
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,368
Our destruction would be instant,

111
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,948
in a fraction of second,

112
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,218
Earth would be gone.

113
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,959
But it actually gets worse.

114
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,686
If the energy level

115
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,036
of the Higgs Field changes,

116
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:10,581
it changes all of physics.

117
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,758
In the true vacuum of the sphere,

118
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,716
the standard model will be overthrown,

119
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,629
superseded by different physics

120
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,139
that we don't know -

121
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,688
how fundamental particles behave,

122
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:22,337
how atoms hold together,

123
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,611
how chemicals react.

124
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,350
Vacuum decay won't just destroy life,

125
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,421
it will destroy chemistry itself,

126
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:31,949
making life as we know it impossible.

127
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,850
We simply have no idea

128
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,538
what it would be like inside.

129
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,199
It might be a shadow of what it is now,

130
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,892
or not.

131
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:40,270
We don't know.

132
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,078
If vacuum decay happens,

133
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,691
the outlook is indeed grim.

134
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:46,319
If you feel slightly worried now,

135
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
don't be.

136
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,028
At this point, false vacuum is speculation

137
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,418
based on our current understanding of

138
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,011
particle physics, which might be wrong.

139
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:55,057
It's kind of like using a ruler

140
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:56,548
to measure a continent.

141
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:58,711
(playful music)

142
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:01,008
Sure, you can do it, but you might be off

143
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,510
by quite a bit at the end.

144
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,769
Right now, no-one can say a vacuum decay

145
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,000
is a thing that's real

146
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,943
or just a scary idea.

147
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:11,500
But even if one or multiple spheres

148
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,310
of death have already started expanding,

149
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,558
the universe is so big

150
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,202
that they might not reach us

151
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:17,787
for billions of years.

152
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:19,113
If they're far enough away,

153
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:20,692
they might not ever be able to reach us

154
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,051
because of the expansion of the universe.

155
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:25,089
The speed of light is not that fast

156
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,609
on the scale of the universe.

157
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,160
So, while vacuum decay is

158
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,259
fascinatingly scary,

159
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,719
right now, there are other things

160
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,663
we should be more afraid of.

161
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,614
In contrast to vacuum decay,

162
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,229
we have the power to prepare

163
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,779
for most of them.

164
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,353
Videos like this one

165
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:44,080
take hundreds of hours to make, so

166
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,431
support us on Patreon

167
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:46,684
if you'd like to learn more about

168
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,281
the destruction of everything.

169
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,793
It really helps us out.

170
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,711
We tried to destroy the universe

171
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:53,261
at least once every few months.

172
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,520
So let us know in the comments,

173
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,260
if you have doomsday scenarios

174
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,183
you would like us to cover.
