1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,219
Аhhh,

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,499
casually watching a video on YouTube

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,339
on a computer more powerful than anything humanity could build a few decades ago.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,839
Тhis progress and all the wonderful machines you take for granted

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,479
are built on a few rare and precious materials

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,959
with names like Terbium, Nneodymium or Tantalum.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,599
Getting these rare materials from the ground into your devices is ugly

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,959
The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,639
and the destruction of entire landscapes.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,398
Dangerous chemicals like cyanide, sulphuric acid or chlorine are used to extract the resources,

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,839
harming biodiversity, workers and locals.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,919
And rare resources are also political tools, when countries restrict access to them to get their way.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,799
But what if we could replace the mining industry on earth,

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,839
with a clean process that can't harm anyone?

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,799
Well, we can; all we need to do is look up.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,399
(catchy introductory music by Kurzgesagt)

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,359
Asteroids are millions of trillions of tons of rocks, metals, and ice.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,059
Leftovers from the cloud that became the planet 4.5 billion years ago.

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,798
They can be as small as a meter or proto-planets the size of entire countries.

20
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,239
Most of them are concentrated in the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,158
while hundreds of thousands more do their own thing between the planets.

22
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,559
As space travel is becoming more feasible

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,599
scientists and economists have been begun looking at the resources found in these asteroids.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,078
Even relatively small metallic asteroids

25
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,719
may contain trillions worth of industrial and precious metals like platinum.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,039
And bigger asteroids like 16 Psyche could contain enough iron nickel to

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,398
cover the world's metal needs for millions of years.

28
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,158
At current market prices the rare raw materials alone would be worth quadrillions of dollars.

29
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,938
Well, not really. But technically.

30
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:59,359
For example, there are more than 20 million tons of gold in the ocean's water

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,559
worth roughly 750 trillion U.S. dollars.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,359
But filtering out the gold would be so expensive that you'd lose money selling it.

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,559
Right now asteroid mining has exactly this problem.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,459
It's too expensive to replace mining on Earth.

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,479
Billions of dollars worth of valuable resources in space are worthless

36
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,679
if it costs trillions to get them.

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,979
What makes it so hard?

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,639
The principals behind mining an asteroid are simple.

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,719
The basic idea is to choose an asteroid

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,799
move it to a place where it's easy to process,

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,079
and then take it apart to turn into useful products.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,959
Unfortunately all of this collides with fundamental problems humans have yet to solve

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,139
Going to space is expensive.

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,199
It costs thousands of dollars in rocket fuel for each kilogram, just to reach a low earth orbit.

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,279
Going further out into deep space costs thousands more.

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,279
We need cheaper space travel to make asteroid mining profitable.

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,919
One solution is to switch from classical rockets to electric spaceships.

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,639
We already use electrical rocket engines
for many of the space probes on science missions.

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,499
In principal, we only need to build bigger ones.

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,039
While electrical engines are not powerful enough to fly to space

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,288
they require only a tiny amount of fuel to go very far once they're in space.

52
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:16,958
This means we don't need to spend a lot of money on fuel

53
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,999
only to transport fuel into space.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,999
This doesn't solve the whole cost problem-

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,279
but it makes it easier to start our first mission.

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,799
Now that we have an electric asteroid-mining spaceship,

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,878
we need to find the right asteroid and get it there.

58
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,139
We've already successfully visited asteroids with space probes

59
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,158
and even collected samples.

60
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,399
Still, to make it easier and cheaper

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,839
our first targets will probably be near-Earth asteroids.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,279
Asteroids that orbit, well, near Earth.

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,719
After a few months of travel

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,598
our spaceship finally arrives at an asteroid.

65
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,399
Weirdly formed, littered with small impact craters,

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,279
it hasn't changed much for billions of years.

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,999
The first thing that needs to be done is
to secure the asteroid and stop it from spinning.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,739
There are multiple ways to do this,

69
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,839
like vaporizing material with a laser

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,238
or stopping the rotation with thrusters.

71
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,558
Once we have a stable asteroid, we need to wait.

72
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,099
Orbital mechanics are complicated,

73
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,199
but if you push something in the right direction
at exactly the right moment,

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,078
you can move very big things with very little force.

75
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,838
So, we wait for exactly the right moment.

76
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:28,159
Our ship fires its thrusters and nudges the asteroid into a trajectory that takes it near our Moon.

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,239
The Moon is useful because we can borrow

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,199
its gravitational pull to put the asteroid
in a stable orbit around Earth,

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,499
which saves even more fuel.

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,719
Again, the trip takes months.

81
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,279
But all the time since our ship was launched
has not been wasted.

82
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,079
The first space mining and processing equipment
has been installed in orbit,

83
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,119
and is now carefully moving towards the asteroid.

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
The processor works very differently than on Earth.

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,839
Giant mirrors focus sunlight and heat up asteroid rock

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,359
to boil out the gases.

87
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,399
Grinders break up the dried rocks into gravel and dust,

88
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,999
and centrifuges separate dense from light elements.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,799
Even if we only extract 0.01% of the asteroid's mass
in precious metals,

90
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,239
this is still several times more than
you'd get from the same amount of ore

91
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,359
on the ground.

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,079
But what now? How do we get our
precious metals safely back to ground?

93
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,259
There are a few ways, like
loading it into reusable rockets

94
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,119
that return to Earth from space.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,758
Or if our processor contains 3-D printers,

96
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,879
we can print a faster and cheaper delivery system.

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,159
Heat shielded capsules filled with gas bubbles.

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,559
These can just be dropped into the oceans
where ships tow them away.

99
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,299
This could be the starting point of
humanity's first real steps

100
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,119
towards colonizing the solar system.

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,539
As our infrastructure and experience grows,

102
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,638
our missions get more and more sophisticated.

103
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,638
Parts and fuel produced on asteroids

104
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,879
don't have to be launched from Earth at all.

105
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,799
The first mining operation makes the second one easier,
and so on.

106
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,299
While the space industry grows

107
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,399
and precious materials become cheaper,

108
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,839
eventually we could stop mining on Earth.

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,559
Even the idea of toxic mining down here

110
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,139
might become something weird and anachronistic,

111
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,679
like having an open fire in your living room.

112
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,799
Landscapes ravaged by pollution will heal,

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,379
while the technological wonders we're used to

114
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,359
get cheaper and less toxic to make.

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,299
None of this is science fiction.

116
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,499
We don't need fancy materials or new physics

117
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,439
to make asteroid mining happen.

118
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,259
We could start building this future today.

119
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,299
All we need is an initial ... push!

120
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,759
Maybe you could also use a little nudge,

121
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,879
not to pursue anything as ambitious as asteroid mining,

122
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
just to try something new and fun.

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,299
Let us give you some tailwind there.

124
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,799
We partnered with Skillshare,

125
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,119
an online learning community

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,918
with thousands of classes in all kinds of creative skills

127
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,399
like graphic design, music, photography,
illustration and animation.

128
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,999
They have something for every skill level,

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,799
so no matter from where you're starting,

130
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,399
there'll be tons of things for you to explore!

131
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,259
If you'd like to take a glimpse
behind the scenes of our animations,

132
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,199
for example, we've made a couple of Skillshare

133
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,999
classes that teach you how we animated

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,379
scenes from our videos,

135
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,279
with video lessons classes and hands-on projects.

136
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,519
Or if you'd rather come up with your own characters
to breathe life into,

137
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,919
we recommend 'Character Illustration: from Concept
to Final Artwork' by Matt Kaufenberg.

138
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,759
But it doesn't really matter what you pick,

139
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,439
as long as you get started,
improve your skills and have some fun.

140
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,638
Unlimited access to all classes is only $10/month
with an annual premium membership.

141
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,839
But we have a treat for the
first 1000 Kurzgesagt viewers to click

142
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,038
the link in the description:
