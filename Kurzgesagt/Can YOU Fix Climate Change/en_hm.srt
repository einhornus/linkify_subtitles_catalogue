1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:06,589
Never before in human history have we been
richer, more advanced or powerful.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:12,000
And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of
rapid climate change.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,820
It seems simple on the surface.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,760
Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun
and transfer it to our atmosphere.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,550
This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,930
Dry places become drier and wet places wetter.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,840
Countless ecosystems will die while the rising
oceans swallow coasts and the cities we build

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,070
on them.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,660
So why don’t we just like… prevent all
of that?

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,469
Well, it’s complicated.

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,350
The public debate about stopping rapid climate
change often focuses on a few key features,

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,010
like coal plants, cars or burping cows.

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,859
And so the solutions are often simplistic
– rows of solar panels, biking to work,

14
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,109
something something sustainability.

15
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:56,719
And a huge talking point is personal responsibility.

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,559
How YOU should change your lifestyle to prevent
rapid climate change, which we will find out

17
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,379
together in the next few minutes.

18
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,438
This is one of those videos where we want
to encourage you to watch to the end, because

19
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:21,750
to discuss real doable solutions, we first
need to understand 

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,750
the problem.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,689
A Fuller Picture

22
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,119
Modern industrial society as we constructed
it in the last 150 years, is inherently destructive

23
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,930
to the planet.

24
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,890
Basically everything we do to make our lives
easier, safer and more comfortable is making

25
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,119
things worse for the biosphere.

26
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:45,341
The food we eat, the streets we walk on, the
clothes we wear, the gadgets we use, the way

27
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:50,630
we move around and the pleasant temperatures
we artificially create around us.

28
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,750
While most people know about the serious impact
of energy, beef, cars and planes, many major

29
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,659
polluters are barely ever talked about.

30
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:02,718
The emissions leaking out of landfills are
as significant as the emissions of all the

31
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,630
jets in the air.

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,479
More CO2 is released to run our homes than
from all cars combined.

33
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,640
And the emissions produced when making a new
car is equivalent to building just two metres

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,880
of road.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,670
So it is nice to switch to electric cars but
they won’t solve anything if we keep building

36
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,200
roads the same way.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,550
Fixing one small part of the industrial system
is not enough.

38
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,060
Each of the many different parts needs its
own solution and many of them aren’t straight

39
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,060
forward.

40
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,950
But even where we know what to do, just because
a solution exists doesn’t mean we are able

41
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,390
or willing to implement it.

42
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,430
There are many gray areas in the fight against
rapid climate change, the most prominent one

43
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,200
is the divide between rich and poor.

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,980
Emissions vs poverty

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,980
There is a clear connection between the prosperity
of a nation and its carbon emissions.

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,500
In other words, richer people tend to cause
more emissions.

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,030
So the key to fixing climate change is simply
for the world’s richest to cut back on their

48
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,840
extravagant lifestyles right?

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,090
While this would help, it wouldn’t make
the problem go away.

50
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,620
This is because 63% of global emissions come
from low to middle income countries.

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,070
Countries where most people are not living
extravagantly but are trying to escape poverty

52
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,380
at worst, and achieve a comfortable lifestyle
at best.

53
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,190
The unfortunate reality is that, currently,
escaping poverty and becoming middle class

54
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,000
creates unavoidable emissions.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,580
So asking developing countries to cut emissions
just looks like an attempt to keep them down.

56
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,730
It is very hard to argue that a region should
protect their primeval forests and spend money

57
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,430
on solar panels instead of burning wood, when
it can’t meet basic needs for significant

58
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,630
parts of its population.

59
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,130
So, cutting back is not a popular demand,
especially if the countries making these demands

60
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,830
got rich by causing environmental damage in
the past.

61
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:06,260
For billions of people, more emissions are
a good thing personally.

62
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,960
When we forget about this, we tend to propose
unworkable solutions.

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Take concrete.

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,430
8% of CO2 emissions are released by the concrete
manufacturing industry.

65
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,680
Ok cool, stop using concrete, right?

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,100
But right now, concrete is also a cheap and
easy way for growing populations in developing

67
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,320
countries to build affordable housing.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,440
And there are many examples like that.

69
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,340
Even rich countries aren’t immune from disagreeing
about rapid climate change solutions.

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,910
Banning coal, gas and oil from the energy
mix is slowed down by heated discussions about

71
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,910
what should replace them.

72
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,690
Citizens can be strictly against nuclear power
but also oppose wind or solar infrastructure

73
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,630
in their backyards.

74
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,880
In principle all of these issues can be overcome
– but there are things we don’t currently

75
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,600
know how to overcome.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,570
The most problematic one is food.

77
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,880
Emit or Die

78
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,380
We will soon need to feed 10 billion people,
and we don’t know how to do that without

79
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,710
emitting greenhouse gases.

80
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,380
Because of the nature of modern food production
that requires fertilizers or manure, it is

81
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,200
impossible to have zero-emissions food.

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,010
Rice alone emits so much methane each year
that it practically equals the emissions of

83
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,019
all the air traffic in the world.

84
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,139
What’s worse is that the foods we like the
most emit the most.

85
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:34,190
57% of food emissions come from animal-based
foods, although they make up only 18% of the

86
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,650
world’s calories, and 37% of its protein.

87
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,650
And as people across the world grow richer,
they want more meat.

88
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,690
Traditional diets in most cultures were primarily
plant based with a little meat on top.

89
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,400
But with the rise of industrial style meat
production and factory farming, meat has become

90
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,810
a staple food; a regular indulgence in developed
countries and a symbol of status and wealth

91
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,139
in developing countries.

92
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,280
Today about 40 percent of the world’s habitable
land is used for meat production in some form

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,450
or another, the size of North and South America
combined.

94
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,669
This is land on which we could otherwise allow
native ecosystems to regrow, like forests

95
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:19,590
in the Amazon, and suck carbon out of the
atmosphere, but instead most of it is used

96
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,820
to feed animals.

97
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,810
The available solutions are uniquely able
to make everybody on the political spectrum,

98
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,630
rich or poor, unhappy.

99
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,680
Meat is highly emotional and there are a lot
of whataboutism arguments floating around,

100
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,950
like comparing it to the worst sources of
emissions.

101
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,820
In the end it is pretty simple: eating less
meat alone won’t stop climate change, but

102
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,010
we also can’t stop climate change without
eating less meat.

103
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,820
The same holds true for other things that
are less crucial to our survival but frankly

104
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,660
not realistic to make go away.

105
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,389
Like air travel, oversea shipping, mining
and the production of devices that play youtube

106
00:06:58,389 --> 00:06:59,820
videos.

107
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,110
So what does this mean?

108
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,340
Do we need to give up our way of life and
can the poor never achieve it?

109
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,350
Can’t some technology save us so we can
continue to drive our big cars and eat meat

110
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,420
every day?

111
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,460
Solutions vs Expenses

112
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:22,980
In principle, this technology already exists:
Direct Air Capture of CO2 draws carbon dioxide

113
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,470
from the air so that it can be stored underground
or transformed into products.

114
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,320
So why aren’t we implementing it in every
industry, everywhere?

115
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,930
Because with the technology we have right
now, this would cost some ten trillion dollars

116
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,690
per year, or half the United States’ GDP.

117
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,820
This money has to come from somewhere and
currently no-one is offering it.

118
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,540
Just dumping these costs on massive polluters
like steel mills and coal power stations would

119
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,710
double the cost of their products – and
so these industries that operate on very tight

120
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,639
profit margins would go bankrupt.

121
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,720
Getting the government to pay for it seems
logical but a lot of state resources are actually

122
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,610
tied up doing the opposite, like subsidizing
oil and gas.

123
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,490
Which seems counter intuitive but follows
clear incentives.

124
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,940
By artificially keeping fuel prices low, shipping
and everyday goods are kept artificially cheap

125
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
too.

126
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,110
Which has a major social impact on billions
of people around the world.

127
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,840
That creates political lobbies and incentives
that perpetuate this cycle that makes it so

128
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,660
hard to cut off fossil fuel production.

129
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,019
Meanwhile, very costly solutions for a far-off
problem like carbon capture seem like they

130
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:37,490
can wait, as technically nobody benefits from
it right now.

131
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,069
Some argue that a move away from capitalism
is the only solution to this mess, others

132
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:47,118
insist that markets should be even freer,
without any interventions like subsidies and

133
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:51,939
some suggest that we need what’s referred
to as “degrowth” and to cut back as a

134
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,180
species overall.

135
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,199
But the truth is at least as of now, no political
system is doing an impressive job at becoming

136
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:03,369
truly sustainable and none have really done
so in the past.

137
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:07,180
We also don’t have the time to figure this
out and do a lot of experiments.

138
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,850
We must implement solutions now.

139
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,320
Not just to halt the release of all possible
greenhouse gases, but also to start reducing

140
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,360
the amount of CO2 in the air.

141
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,559
It’s too late to just mend our ways, we
have to actively correct our past mistakes.

142
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,529
With every year we waste, more extreme changes
will be unavoidable.

143
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:27,529
Ok.

144
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:30,759
Let’s take a deep breath.

145
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,009
Rapid climate change and the world we live
in are complicated.

146
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:38,339
So here is where YOU, dear viewer, come in
again.

147
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,320
Could YOU please fix the climate?

148
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,800
A narrative of our time is that we are all
responsible for rapid climate change.

149
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,779
That everyone needs to play their part.

150
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,959
Why don’t you buy a new electric car?

151
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,759
Why don’t you replace your gas stove with
an electric one?

152
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,869
How about you double glaze your windows, stop
eating meat and switch off your lights?

153
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:03,660
Shifting responsibility from the largest carbon
emitters to the average person, you, is much

154
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,910
easier to do than solving problems.

155
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,259
There’s an extra bonus if solving rapid
climate change sells a new product.

156
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:14,660
If you don’t have the money or time for
these things, you should feel bad.

157
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,320
It’s an effective message because it is
true.

158
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,920
The quickest way to cut CO2 emissions would
be if all rich populations on Earth drastically

159
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,899
changed their lifestyles and if the people
on the rise would not seek to achieve it.

160
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,649
Favouring the climate over comfort and wealth.

161
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:34,459
If you are able to watch this video, this
includes you.

162
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:39,869
But we’ve just witnessed a global experiment
in staying at home, not using transport and

163
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:43,240
consuming less during the coronavirus pandemic.

164
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,180
And all it did was reduce CO2 emissions by
7% for 2020.

165
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,459
Asking average people to solve rapid climate
change breaks down when we look at the scale

166
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,079
of the problem.

167
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,689
Personal contributions toward reducing greenhouse
gas emissions are nice, but they are dwarfed

168
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:02,449
by the systemic reality of global emissions.

169
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:07,470
The concept of your personal carbon footprint
was popularized by the oil producer BP in

170
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,839
a 2005 ad campaign.

171
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,660
Arguably one of the most effective and sinister
pieces of propaganda that still seriously

172
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,319
distracts all of us from the reality of the
situation.

173
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:23,649
If you eliminated 100% of your emissions for
the rest of your life, you would save one

174
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,980
second’s worth of emissions from the global
energy sector.

175
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,660
Even the most motivated person can’t even
make a tiny dent.

176
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,250
When we put together the dangers of rapid
climate change, the scale of emissions and

177
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,480
the lack of consensus over how to solve it,
the challenge seems insurmountable.

178
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,689
It can cause decision fatigue and moral licensing,
where you no longer feel bad about behaving

179
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:47,029
in a counter productive way.

180
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:52,220
We have struggled a long time with this, which
is why this video took us so long to make.

181
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
So.

182
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,720
What can you actually do?

183
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,699
There are many different takes and they are
passionately discussed.

184
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:05,350
We don’t know who is right, so we can only
offer you the Kurzgesagt perspective and opinion.

185
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,529
Opinion Part: What can you ACTUALLY do?

186
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,829
We need a different way to think and talk
about rapid climate change.

187
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:17,800
An all-encompassing systemic approach, nothing
less than changing the fundamentals of our

188
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,489
modern industrial societies.

189
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:25,869
As discussed in frustrating length, the personal
responsibility angle is overplayed.

190
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:30,610
For systemic changes in technology, politics
and the economy of this magnitude, we need

191
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,570
to influence the people at the levers.

192
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,699
Politicians need to know and feel strongly
that the people care, that their own success

193
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,959
depends on tackling rapid climate change.

194
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,180
When governments and local politicians are
reluctant to change laws that affect their

195
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,449
biggest tax contributors or campaign donors,
we need to vote them out and vote in people

196
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,509
who respect science.

197
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:58,749
We need to hold them accountable for implementing
the most effective climate change strategies.

198
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:03,889
Not waste our time with things like banning
plastic straws but by moving the big levers:

199
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:09,100
Food, transportation and energy while not
forgetting the smaller ones like cement or

200
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,050
construction.

201
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,869
When industries fight against changing their
ways, for fear of losses or in an honest attempt

202
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:20,779
to protect their own, we need politicians
to change the laws and incentivise the deployment

203
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,879
of existing technologies and massively invest
in innovation for the fields where we don’t

204
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,670
have great solutions yet.

205
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,290
There is no reason that the profit interests
of industries could not match the need to

206
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,370
reduce carbon emissions as much as possible.

207
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,569
And if they still don’t cooperate harsh
punishments and regulation need to force or

208
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,430
bankrupt them.

209
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,209
It's still unrealistic that change of that
scope can be forced onto a worldwide economy

210
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:53,100
quickly enough, because many low carbon technologies
still need a lot of time and research – which

211
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,220
means they are expensive.

212
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,519
But more companies will make more efficient
carbon capture systems, tasty meat alternatives,

213
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,730
better batteries, cement alternatives and
so on, if there is a clear and growing demand.

214
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,799
And if you are affluent enough, you can do
your part by investing in these things right

215
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,629
now while they're still expensive.

216
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:16,540
These are the mechanisms that will drive the
prices down later on.

217
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,230
So this is basically what you can do.

218
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,550
Vote at the ballot, vote with your wallet.

219
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,290
There are too many opposing interests and
complicated grey zones.

220
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,550
In the end if we truly get the systemic change
we need, everybody will be unhappy about some

221
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,779
aspect of it.

222
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,199
Only if we all accept that some solutions
will have negative impacts for us, can we

223
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,879
have an honest conversation and make progress.

224
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,589
Everybody will be a little unhappy.

225
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,309
And that is ok.

226
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,069
This is the best you can do.

227
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:50,769
You can deal with the reality of the situation
and promote your priorities through your behaviour

228
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,310
and your actions.

229
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,309
And while you do so, you can eat less meat,
fly less or get an electric car.

230
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:00,899
Not because you should feel guilty if you
don’t or because you naively believe that

231
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:07,670
you alone can stop rapid climate change – but
to do your tiny, tiny part for the systemic

232
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,899
change we need.

233
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,629
