1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,039
never before in human history have we

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,398
been richer more advanced more powerful

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,439
and yet we feel overwhelmed in the face

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,839
of rapid climate change

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,319
it seems simple on the surface

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,078
greenhouse gases trap energy from the

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,479
sun and transfer it to our atmosphere

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,559
this leads to warmer winters harsher

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,278
summers dry places become drier and wet

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,999
places wetter countless ecosystems will

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,159
die while the rising oceans swallow

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,879
coasts and the cities we build on them

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,439
so why don't we just like prevent all of

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,558
that

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,359
well

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,279
it's complicated

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,119
the public debate about stopping rapid

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,279
climate change often focuses on a few

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,919
key features like coal plants cars or

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,359
burping cows

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,959
and so the solutions are often

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,078
simplistic

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,639
rows of solar panels biking to work

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,119
something something sustainability and a

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,198
huge talking point is personal

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,759
responsibility how you should change

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,238
your lifestyle to prevent rapid climate

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,238
change which we'll find out together in

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,079
the next few minutes

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,839
this is one of those videos where we

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,438
want to encourage you to watch to the

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,999
end because to discuss real doable

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,639
solutions we first need to understand

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,200
the problem

35
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,220
[Music]

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,319
a fuller picture

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,399
modern industrial society as we

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,679
constructed it in the last 150 years is

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,399
inherently destructive to the planet

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,319
basically everything we do to make our

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,118
lives easier safer and more comfortable

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,999
is making things worse for the biosphere

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,398
the food we eat the streets we walk on

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,959
the clothes we wear the gadgets we use

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,039
the way we move around and the pleasant

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,959
temperatures we artificially create

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,319
around us

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,158
while most people know about the serious

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,039
impact of energy beef cars and planes

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,959
many major polluters are barely ever

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,398
talked about

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,478
the emissions leaking out of landfills

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,398
are as significant as the emissions of

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,239
all the jets in the air

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,879
more co2 is released to run our homes

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,519
than from all cars combined and the

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,999
emissions produced when making a new car

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,079
is equivalent to building just two

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,679
meters of road

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,159
so it is nice to switch to electric cars

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,238
but they won't solve anything if we keep

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,719
building roads the same way

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,119
fixing one small part of the industrial

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,279
system is not enough

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,199
each of the many different parts needs

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,279
its own solution and many of them aren't

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,719
straightforward

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,878
but even where we know what to do just

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,199
because a solution exists doesn't mean

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,079
we're able or willing to implement it

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,238
there are many grey areas in the fight

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,399
against rapid climate change the most

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,119
prominent one is the divide between rich

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,518
and poor

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,719
emissions versus poverty

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,719
there is a clear connection between the

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,799
prosperity of a nation and its carbon

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,279
emissions in other words richer people

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,759
tend to cause more emissions so the key

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,919
to fixing climate change is simply for

81
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,999
the world's richest to cut back on their

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,479
extravagant lifestyles right

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,799
while this would help it wouldn't make

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,799
the problem go away

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,679
this is because 63 of global emissions

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,079
come from low to middle income countries

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,079
countries where most people are not

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,079
living extravagantly but are trying to

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,719
escape poverty at worst and achieve a

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,119
comfortable lifestyle at best

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,119
the unfortunate reality is that

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,359
currently escaping poverty and becoming

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,439
middle class creates unavoidable

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,798
emissions

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,798
so asking developing countries to cut

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,559
emissions just looks like an attempt to

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,999
keep them down

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,839
it's very hard to argue that a region

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,839
should protect their primeval forests

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,919
and spend money on solar panels instead

101
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,158
of burning wood when it can't meet basic

102
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,919
needs for significant parts of its

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,679
population

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,559
but cutting back is not a popular demand

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,559
especially if the countries making these

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,479
demands got rich by causing

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,199
environmental damage in the past

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,759
so for billions of people more emissions

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,999
are a good thing personally

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,999
when we forget about this we tend to

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,639
propose unworkable solutions

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,199
take concrete eight percent of co2

113
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,119
emissions are released by the concrete

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,357
manufacturing industry

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,797
okay cool stop using concrete right

116
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,198
but right now concrete is also a cheap

117
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,599
and easy way for growing populations in

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,519
developing countries to build affordable

119
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,559
housing

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,039
and there are many examples like that

121
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,198
even rich countries aren't immune from

122
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,119
disagreeing about rapid climate change

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,758
solutions banning coal gas and oil from

124
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,079
the energy mixes slowed down by heated

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,679
discussions about what should replace

126
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,478
them

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,319
the citizens can be strictly against

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,719
nuclear power but also oppose wind or

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,439
solar infrastructure in their backyards

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,359
in principle all of these issues can be

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,279
overcome but there are things we don't

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,439
currently know how to overcome

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,119
the most problematic one is food

134
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,679
emit or die

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,918
we will soon need to feed 10 billion

136
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,918
people and we don't know how to do that

137
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,559
without emitting greenhouse gases

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,159
because of the nature of modern food

139
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,239
production that requires fertilizers or

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,478
manure it's impossible to have zero

141
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,999
emissions food

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,399
rice alone emits so much methane each

143
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,239
year that it practically equals the

144
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,239
emissions of all the air traffic in the

145
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,959
world what's worse is that the foods we

146
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,198
like the most emit the most

147
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,159
57 of food emissions come from animal

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,719
based foods although they make up only

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,799
18 of the world's calories and 37 of its

150
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,918
protein and as people across the world

151
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,478
grow richer they want more meat

152
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,559
traditional diets in most cultures were

153
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,799
primarily plant-based with a little meat

154
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,198
on top but with the rise of industrial

155
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,799
style meat production and factory

156
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,999
farming meat has become a staple food

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,999
a regular indulgence in developed

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,399
countries and a symbol of status and

159
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,959
wealth in developing countries

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,198
today about 40 percent of the world's

161
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,959
habitable land is used for meat

162
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,119
production in some form or another the

163
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,159
size of north and south america combined

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,918
this is land we could otherwise allow

165
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,559
native ecosystems to regrow like forests

166
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,638
in the amazon and suck carbon out of the

167
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,198
atmosphere but instead most of it is

168
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,599
used to feed animals

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,079
the available solutions are uniquely

170
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,758
able to make everybody on the political

171
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,279
spectrum rich or poor unhappy

172
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,519
meat is highly emotional and there are a

173
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,679
lot of what about his arguments floating

174
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,399
around

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,478
like comparing it to the worst sources

176
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,758
of emissions

177
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,239
in the end it's pretty simple eating

178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,079
less meat alone won't stop climate

179
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,079
change but we also can't stop climate

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,799
change without eating less meat

181
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,318
the same holds true for other things

182
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,159
that are less crucial to our survival

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,478
but frankly not realistic to make go

184
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,359
away

185
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,239
like air travel oc shipping mining and

186
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,918
the production of devices that play

187
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,598
youtube videos

188
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,839
so what does this mean do we need to

189
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,918
give up our way of life and can the poor

190
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,359
never achieve it

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,159
can't some technology save us so we can

192
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,719
continue to drive our big cars and eat

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,719
meat every day

194
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,239
solutions versus expenses

195
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,638
in principle this technology already

196
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,758
exists

197
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,318
direct air capture of co2 draws carbon

198
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,399
dioxide from the air so that it can be

199
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,879
stored underground or transformed into

200
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,918
products

201
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,598
so why aren't we implementing it in

202
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,918
every industry everywhere

203
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,679
because with the technology we have

204
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,079
right now this would cost some 10

205
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,318
trillion dollars per year or half the

206
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,399
united states gdp

207
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,159
this money has to come from somewhere

208
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,198
and currently no one is offering it

209
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,439
just dumping these costs on massive

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,359
polluters like steel mills and coal

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,359
power stations would double the cost of

212
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,279
their products and so these industries

213
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,038
that operate on very tight profit

214
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,359
margins would go bankrupt

215
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,878
getting the government to pay for it

216
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,638
seems logical but a lot of state

217
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,559
resources are actually tied up doing the

218
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,279
opposite like subsidizing oil and gas

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,198
which seems counter-intuitive but

220
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,279
follows clear incentives

221
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,839
by artificially keeping fuel prices low

222
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,918
shipping and everyday goods are kept

223
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,399
artificially cheap too which has a major

224
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,239
social impact on billions of people

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,839
around the world

226
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,758
that creates political lobbies and

227
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,159
incentives that perpetuate a cycle that

228
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,478
makes it so hard to stop fossil fuel

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,918
production

230
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,159
meanwhile very costly solutions for a

231
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,639
far-off problem like carbon capture seem

232
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,798
like they can wait as technically nobody

233
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,199
benefits from it right now

234
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,199
some argue that a move away from

235
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,199
capitalism is the only solution to this

236
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,359
mess others insist that markets should

237
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,759
be even freer without any interventions

238
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,999
like subsidies and some suggest that we

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,958
need what's referred to as d growth and

240
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,159
to cut back as a species overall but the

241
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,799
truth is at least as of now no political

242
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,719
system is doing an impressive job at

243
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,199
becoming truly sustainable and none have

244
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,119
really done so in the past

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,958
we also don't have the time to figure

246
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,199
this out and do a lot of experiments we

247
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,599
must implement solutions now

248
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,199
not just to halt the release of all

249
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,439
possible greenhouse gases but also to

250
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,599
start reducing the amount of co2 in the

251
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,639
air

252
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,879
it's too late to just mend our ways we

253
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,199
have to actively correct our past

254
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,239
mistakes with every year we waste more

255
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,199
extreme changes will be unavoidable

256
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,319
okay let's take a deep breath

257
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,079
rapid climate change in the world we

258
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,958
live in are complicated so here is where

259
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,079
you dear viewer come in again

260
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,958
could you please fix the climate

261
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,039
a narrative of our time is that we are

262
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,518
all responsible for rapid climate change

263
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,079
that everyone needs to play their part

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,479
why don't you buy a new electric car why

265
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,239
don't you replace your gas stove with an

266
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,518
electric one

267
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,359
how about you double glaze your windows

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,119
stop eating meat and switch off your

269
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,639
lights

270
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,639
shifting responsibility from the largest

271
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,719
carbon emitters to the average person

272
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,958
you is much easier to do than solving

273
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,159
problems

274
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,319
there's an extra bonus if solving rapid

275
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,039
climate change sells a new product

276
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,799
if you don't have the money or time for

277
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,199
these things you should feel bad

278
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,199
it's an effective message because it's

279
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,759
true the quickest way to cut co2

280
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,199
emissions would be if all rich

281
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,278
populations on earth drastically change

282
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,039
their lifestyles and if the people on

283
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,679
the rise would not seek to achieve it

284
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,159
favoring the climate over comfort and

285
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,119
wealth

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,278
if you're able to watch this video that

287
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,799
includes you

288
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,479
but we've just witnessed a global

289
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,879
experiment in staying at home not using

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,119
transport and consuming less during the

291
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,958
coronavirus pandemic

292
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,039
and all it did was reduce co2 emissions

293
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,679
by 7 for 2020

294
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,838
asking average people to solve rapid

295
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,759
climate change breaks down when we look

296
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,599
at the scale of the problem

297
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,679
personal contributions towards reducing

298
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,599
greenhouse gas emissions are nice but

299
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,398
they are dwarfed by the systemic reality

300
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,239
of global emissions

301
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,999
the concept of your personal carbon

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,759
footprint was popularized by the oil

303
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,439
producer bp in a 2005 ad campaign

304
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,838
arguably one of the most effective and

305
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,078
sinister pieces of propaganda that still

306
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,838
seriously distracts all of us from the

307
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,078
reality of the situation

308
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,958
if you eliminated 100 of your emissions

309
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,119
for the rest of your life you would save

310
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,958
one second's worth of emissions from the

311
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,559
global energy sector

312
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,958
even the most motivated person can't

313
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,359
even make a tiny dent

314
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,879
when we put together the dangers of

315
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,479
rapid climate change the scale of

316
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,398
emissions and the lack of consensus over

317
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,719
how to solve it the challenge seems

318
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,039
insurmountable it can cause decision

319
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,199
fatigue and moral licensing where you no

320
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,879
longer feel bad about behaving in a

321
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,799
counterproductive way

322
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,799
we have struggled a long time with this

323
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,199
which is why this video took us so long

324
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,239
to make

325
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,199
so what can you actually do

326
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,879
there are many different takes and they

327
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,039
are passionately discussed we don't know

328
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,278
who's right so we can only offer you the

329
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,119
courts kazakh's perspective and opinion

330
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,278
opinion part what can you actually do

331
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,958
we need a different way to think and

332
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,199
talk about rapid climate change an

333
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,278
all-encompassing systemic approach

334
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,799
nothing less than changing the

335
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,799
fundamentals of our modern industrial

336
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,159
societies

337
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,398
as discussed in frustrating length the

338
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,239
personal responsibility angle is

339
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,518
overplayed

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,679
for systemic changes in technology

341
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,278
politics and the economy of this

342
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,518
magnitude we need to influence the

343
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,838
people at the levers

344
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,838
politicians need to know and feel

345
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,919
strongly that the people care that their

346
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,239
own success depends on tackling rapid

347
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,679
climate change

348
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,838
when governments and local politicians

349
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,919
are reluctant to change laws that affect

350
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,679
their biggest tax contributors or

351
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,239
campaign donors we need to vote them out

352
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,278
and vote in people who respect science

353
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,039
we need to hold them accountable for

354
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,039
implementing the most effective climate

355
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,479
change strategies

356
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,239
not waste our time with things like

357
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,638
banning plastic straws but by moving the

358
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,919
big levers

359
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,719
food transportation and energy while not

360
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,799
forgetting the smaller ones like cement

361
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,799
or construction

362
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,638
when industries fight against changing

363
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,119
their ways for fear of losses or an

364
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,958
honest attempt to protect their own we

365
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,278
need politicians to change the laws and

366
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,278
incentivize the deployment of existing

367
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,679
technologies and massively invest in

368
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,679
innovation for the fields where we don't

369
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,999
have great solutions yet

370
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,679
there's no reason that the profit

371
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,679
interests of industries could not match

372
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,518
the need to reduce carbon emissions as

373
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,039
much as possible

374
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,359
and if they still don't cooperate harsh

375
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,159
punishments and regulation need to force

376
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,159
or bankrupt them

377
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,239
it's still unrealistic the change of

378
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,239
that scope can be forced onto a

379
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,479
worldwide economy quickly enough because

380
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,879
many low carbon technologies still need

381
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,599
a lot of time and research which means

382
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,958
they're expensive

383
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,479
but more companies will make more

384
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,559
efficient carbon capture systems tasty

385
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,479
meat alternatives better batteries

386
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,879
cement alternatives and so on if there's

387
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,359
a clear and growing demand

388
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,599
and if you're affluent enough you can do

389
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,518
your part by investing in these things

390
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,319
right now while they're still expensive

391
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,078
these are the mechanisms that will drive

392
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,398
the prices down later on

393
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,879
so this is basically what you can do

394
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,999
vote at the ballot vote with your wallet

395
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,838
there are too many opposing interests

396
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,159
and complicated gray zones

397
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,638
in the end if we truly get the systemic

398
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,958
change we need everybody will be unhappy

399
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,799
about some aspect to it

400
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,559
only if we all accept that some

401
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,479
solutions will have negative impacts for

402
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,559
us can we have an honest conversation

403
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,319
and make progress

404
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,398
everybody will be a little unhappy and

405
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,838
that's okay this is the best you can do

406
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,359
you can deal with the reality of the

407
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,599
situation and promote your priorities

408
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,078
through your behavior and your actions

409
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,159
and while you do so you can eat less

410
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,039
meat fly less or get an electric car

411
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,638
not because you should feel guilty if

412
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,638
you don't or because you naively believe

413
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,719
that you alone can stop rapid climate

414
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,078
change but to do your tiny tiny part for

415
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,079
the systemic change we need

416
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,039
