1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,319
We humans are unable  to experience the
true nature of the universe, unfiltered.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,579
Our senses and brains can only
process a fraction of the world.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,979
So we have to use concepts and tools, to
learn about the true nature of reality

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,599
Technological progress not only widened
our knowledge about the universe,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,459
it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,839
In the future, it might become possible
to simulate entire universes.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,679
But if this is an option, how can we know
that it's not already happened?

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,919
What if we are not creators, but creations?

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:53,359
Is it possible that we are not real,
and we don't even know it?

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,179
If our current understanding of physics is correct,

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,519
Then, it's impossible to simulate the whole universe,
with its trillions and trillions of things.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,899
But we don't actually need to, anyway.

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,359
We only need enough universe to fool
the inhabitants of our simulation,

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,459
into thinking that they're real.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,679
Who needs billions of galaxies?

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,699
We only need the space our
subjects are allowed to explore.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,759
The vast universe could just be a flat projection, and they would have no way to know.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,159
What about small things like cells or bacteria?

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,979
We don't really need them.

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,219
When you use a microscope, what you
see could be instantly created.

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,179
Same with atoms the chair you're sitting
on right now does not need to be

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,539
simulated with quadrillions of atoms.

23
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,779
We just need the outermost layer of it,

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,959
it might be empty inside, until you
decide to break it open.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:55,019
Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things,
but it might be empty, until you open it.

26
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,859
The minimum requirement for our simulation,
is only the consciousness of our virtual humans.

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,059
Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real.

28
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,779
Okay, so are we being simulated?

29
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,479
Well, maybe, but there are a few
conditions that need to be met.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,759
Obviously, we have no authority over this topic,
so please take everything we say with a grain of salt.

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,899
Based on a modified version of the original
simulation argument by Nick Bostrom,

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,279
we have five assumptions for you.

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,139
If they're true, you dear viewer are living in a simulation.

34
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,539
Assumption one,

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,899
it's possible to simulate consciousness

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,419
Nobody knows what consciousness is.

37
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,159
For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain.

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,059
Brains are pretty complex.

39
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,559
If you count every interaction between
synapses as one operation,

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:00,299
your brain runs at about ten to the power of seventeen, for one hundred million billion operations, per second.

41
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,719
Let's generously assume we need ten
to the power of twenty operations,

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,599
to simulate one second of human consciousness.

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,999
But, we don't want to simulate just one human...

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,639
We want to simulate all of human history at once,
so we can skip around.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,279
Let's say we want to simulate two hundred billion humans, with an average life span of fifty years.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,619
One year has thirty million seconds times fifty years

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,339
times two hundred billion humans

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,719
times ten to the power of twenty operations.

49
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,199
So we need a computer able to handle million,
trillion, trillion, trillion operations per second.

50
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,479
More operations than there are stars
in the observable universe.

51
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,199
The computer like this is just impossible.

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,479
Except, maybe it isn't.

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,819
Assumption two,

54
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,099
technological progress will not stop anytime soon.

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,819
If we assume that technological progress continues
in a similar fashion as it has so far,

56
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,579
then there might be galaxy spanning civilizations,
with unlimited computer power at some point.

57
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,959
Beings on a technology level so advanced, that we
could barely distinguish them from god's.

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,079
A computer that can handle a million trillion, trillion, trillion operations is serious business,

59
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,999
but there are actually concepts for computers,
which could handle this.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,898
The Matrioshka Brain, is the theoretical megastructure,

61
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,299
made up of billions of parts orbiting a star,
feeding on its radiation.

62
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,379
A computer of this scale, would have enough
power to simulate many thousands,

63
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,819
if not millions of humanities, at the same time.

64
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,759
Other technologies, like high-end future quantum computers might lower the size drastically,

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,279
so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city, or even smaller.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,219
But, only if there's still someone around
to build the computer.

67
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,579
Assumption three,

68
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,579
advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves.

69
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,499
If there is a point at which all civilizations destroyed themselves, this whole discussion ends here.

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,839
Looking into space, you'd expect to universe filled,
with millions of alien civilizations,

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,519
but we see nobody.

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,859
the reason for this might be, Great Filters.

73
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,119
Great Filters are barriers life has to overcome,
like nuclear war,

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,259
asteroids, climate change or a black hole generator.

75
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,259
If life is inherently self-destructive,
then there are no simulations.

76
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,119
We explain this in more detail, in our 
Fermi Paradox video.

77
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,579
Assumption four,

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,999
super advanced civilizations, want to run simulations.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,059
When we speak of posthuman civilizations,
we don't know what we're dealing with

80
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,359
To think we know what beings as powerful
as gods want, is pretty arrogant.

81
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,199
Imagine the smartest ant on earth living
next to an amusement park,

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,759
It's curious about what humans are up to, 
so you try to explain.

83
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,239
Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand.

84
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,599
The concept of rollercoasters and standing
in lines and holidays and fun,

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,179
doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life.

86
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,139
It's the same with us and a posthuman being,

87
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,639
compared to them, we are ants.

88
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,859
Running simulations for fun or science,
might be an absurdly stupid idea to them.

89
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,899
But, if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons and assumptions one, two, three are true too,

90
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,999
then the chances are not zero that you
are living inside a simulation.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,539
Assumption five,

92
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,059
if there are a lot of simulations, you are
probably inside a simulation.

93
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,619
if there are simulated civilizations,
It's likely that there are a lot of them.

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,339
After all, we assume that post human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power.

95
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,739
So if they run simulations, it would be convenient
to run millions or even billions of them.

96
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,939
If there are billions of simulated universes, there are probably trillions and trillions of

97
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,679
simulated conscious beings.

98
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,099
which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed,

99
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,959
are simulated.

100
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,299
So, for every conscious being made of flesh,
a billion simulated ones exists.

101
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,559
Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not,

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,659
in this case, the chances of you being one
of the nine hundred and ninety nine million

103
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,339
nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine simulated ones, are pretty high.

104
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,859
So, what you consider reality, might not be real at all

105
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,559
You really might be...

106
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,779
simulated.

107
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,819
All of this is based on a lot of assumptions
that we can't really test right now

108
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,719
So many scientists disagree with
this whole thought experiment.

109
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,299
So don't burn your house down to test 
if there will be glitches.

110
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,999
If you are simulated, not that much changes for you

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,899
you might be on a small planet speeding
through eternal nothingness,

112
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,439
or a simulation inside a computer.

113
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,579
your existence does not become
more or less scary and bizarre.

114
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,159
All we can hope to do is try to live good lives,
and have a good time.

115
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,319
And hope that if we actually are simulations
in a supercomputer,

116
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,299
nobody trips over the power cable.

117
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,799
Oh, oh, oh no, I think I just unplugged the simulation

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:18,259
But what if that doesn't matter, what if we are in one right now? What if you are simulated?

119
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,199
