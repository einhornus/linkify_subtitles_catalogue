1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:03,581
What is the largest star in the universe

2
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:05,412
and why is it that large?

3
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:07,557
And what are stars anyway?

4
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:11,235
Things That Would Like To Be Stars

5
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:13,690
We begin our journey with Earth.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,068
Not to learn anything,

7
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:17,128
just to get a vague sense of scale.

8
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:20,507
The smallest things that have
some star-like properties

9
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:23,703
are large gas giants, or sub-brown dwarfs.

10
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:27,590
Like Jupiter, the most massive
planet in the solar system.

11
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:32,024
Eleven times larger and 317
times more massive than Earth,

12
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:35,282
and more or less, made of
the same stuff as our Sun.

13
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:37,498
Just much, much less of it.

14
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:41,546
The transition towards stars
begins with brown dwarfs,

15
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:45,159
failed stars, that are a huge
disappointment to their moms.

16
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:49,651
They have between 13 and 90
times the mass of Jupiter.

17
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:53,239
So even if we took 90 Jupiters and
threw them at each other,

18
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,746
although fun to watch,

19
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:57,048
it wouldn't be enough to create a star.

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,959
Interestingly, adding lots of mass
to a brown dwarf

21
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,701
doesn't make it much bigger,

22
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,831
just its insides denser.

23
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,984
This increases the pressure
in the core enough

24
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,292
to make certain nuclear fusion
reactions happen slowly,

25
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,272
and the object glow a little.

26
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:16,996
So brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy
gas giant,

27
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:19,895
that don't fit into any category very
well.

28
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:22,264
But we want to talk about stars,

29
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:25,373
not failed wannabe stars, so let's
move on.

30
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:28,379
Main Sequence Stars

31
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,352
Once large gas balls pass a certain
mass threshold,

32
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:35,538
their cores become hot and dense
enough to ignite.

33
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:39,586
Hydrogen is fused to helium in their
cores,

34
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,288
releasing tremendous amounts of energy.

35
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:45,905
Stars that do that are called 
main sequence stars.

36
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,701
The more massive a main sequence star is,

37
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,430
the hotter and brighter it burns,

38
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:51,994
and the shorter its life is.

39
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:55,433
Once the hydrogen-burning phase is over,

40
00:01:55,433 --> 00:02:00,459
stars grow up to hundreds of 
thousands of times their original size.

41
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,375
But these giant phases only last for a
fraction of their lifespan.

42
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:08,822
So we'll be comparing stars at 
drastically

43
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:10,755
different stages in their lives.

44
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,014
This doesn't make them less impressive,

45
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:15,441
but maybe it's good to keep in mind
that we'll be

46
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,668
comparing babies to adults.

47
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,017
Now back to the beginning,

48
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:23,017
the smallest real stars are red dwarfs.

49
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,673
About 100 times the mass of Jupiter;

50
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:29,138
barely massive enough to fuse
hydrogen to helium.

51
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:31,243
Because they are not very massive

52
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:34,697
they are small, not very hot, and shine
pretty dimly.

53
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,807
They are the only stars in the main
sequence that

54
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:39,436
don't grow once they die

55
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,393
but sort of fizzle out.

56
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:44,570
Red dwarfs are by far the most

57
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,415
abundant type in the universe,

58
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:48,882
because they burn their fuel so slowly,

59
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:51,951
it lasts them up to ten trillion years -

60
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,245
a thousand times the current age of
the universe.

61
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:59,943
For example, one of the closest stars
to Earth is a red dwarf star,

62
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:01,352
Barnard's Star,

63
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:04,186
but it shines too dimly to be seen
without a telescope.

64
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:07,454
We made a whole video on red dwarfs
if you want to learn more.

65
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,853
The next stage are stars like our Sun.

66
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:13,138
To say the Sun dominates the solar

67
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:15,019
system is not doing it justice

68
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,050
since it makes up 99.86% of all its mass.

69
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,131
It burns far hotter and brighter than
red dwarfs,

70
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:26,421
which reduces its lifetime to about 10
billion years.

71
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:29,910
The Sun is 7 times more massive than
Barnard's Star,

72
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:33,057
but that makes it nearly 300 times
brighter with

73
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:35,334
twice its surface temperature.

74
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,444
Let's go bigger!

75
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:40,619
Small changes in mass produce enormous

76
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:43,078
changes in a main sequence star's
brightness.

77
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:47,990
The brightest star in the night sky,
Sirius, is 2 solar masses

78
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,085
with a radius 1.7 times that of the Sun,

79
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:54,852
but its surface is nearly 10,000°C,

80
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,726
making it shine 25 times brighter.

81
00:03:58,283 --> 00:04:00,491
Burning THAT hot reduces its total

82
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,718
lifespan by 4 times to 2.5 billion years.

83
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:08,189
Stars close to 10 times the mass of
our sun

84
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,777
have surface temperatures near 25,000°C.

85
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:15,722
Beta Centauri contains two of these
massive stars,

86
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:19,541
each shining with about 20,000 times
the power of the Sun.

87
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,772
That's a lot of power coming from

88
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,929
something only 13 times larger,

89
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,970
but they'll only burn for about 20
million years.

90
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,364
Entire generations of the blue stars
die in the time

91
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:33,810
it takes for the Sun to orbit the galaxy
once.

92
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,277
So is this the formula?

93
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:39,359
The more massive, the larger the star.

94
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:43,672
The most massive star that we know
is R136a1.

95
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:47,082
It has 315 solar masses

96
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:50,146
and is nearly 9 million times brighter
than the Sun.

97
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:53,601
And yet, despite its tremendous mass
and power,

98
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,818
it's barely 30 times the size of the Sun!

99
00:04:57,108 --> 00:05:01,218
The star is so extreme and barely held
together by gravity

100
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,688
that is loses 321 thousand billion tons

101
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:06,812
of material through its stellar wind

102
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:08,534
every single second.

103
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:12,173
Stars of this sort are extremely rare
because they

104
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:15,086
break the rules of star formation a
tiny bit.

105
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,605
When supermassive stars are born

106
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:20,119
they burn extremely hot and bright

107
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:22,255
and this blows away any extra gas

108
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,149
that could make them more massive.

109
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,523
So the mass limit for such a star is

110
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:28,896
around 150 times the Sun.

111
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,152
Stars like R136a1 are probably formed
through

112
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:35,215
the merger of several high mass stars

113
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,890
in dense star-forming regions

114
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:40,743
and burn their core hydrogen in only
a few million years.

115
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:44,287
So this means they are rare and short
lived.

116
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:48,166
From here the trick to going bigger
isn't adding more mass.

117
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:51,116
To make the biggest stars we have

118
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,278
to kill them.

119
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:54,742
Red Giants

120
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,073
When main sequence stars begin to

121
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,913
exhaust the hydrogen in their core

122
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:01,581
it contracts making it hotter and denser.

123
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:04,814
This leads to hotter and faster fusion

124
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,922
which pushes back against gravity

125
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:10,005
and makes the outer layers swell in a
giant phase.

126
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:13,647
And these stars become truly giant indeed.

127
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:16,375
For example, Gacrux.

128
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:19,422
Only 30% more massive than the Sun,

129
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:23,411
it has swollen to about 84 times its
radius.

130
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,649
Still, when the Sun enters the last
stage of its life,

131
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,177
it will swell and become even bigger;

132
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:31,711
200 times its current radius!

133
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:34,460
In this final phase of its life

134
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,322
it will swallow the inner planets.

135
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:38,652
And if you think THAT'S impressive

136
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:41,717
let's finally introduce the largest stars
in the universe:

137
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,267
Hypergiants

138
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:48,499
Hypergiants are the giant phase of the 
most massive stars in the universe.

139
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:51,691
They have an enormous surface area

140
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:54,541
that can radiate an insane amount of 
light.

141
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:58,834
Being so large they're basically
blowing themselves apart

142
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:02,983
as gravity at the surface is too weak to 
hold on to the hot mass

143
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,341
which is lifted away in powerful stellar 
winds.

144
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:09,503
Pistol Star is 25 solar masses

145
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:12,273
but 300 times the radius of the sun;

146
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:16,298
a blue hypergiant aptly named for its 
energetic blue starlight.

147
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:20,256
It's hard to say exactly how long Pistol
Star will live

148
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:22,714
but probably just a few million years.

149
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,476
Even larger than the blue hypergiants

150
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:27,053
are the yellow hypergiants.

151
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,884
The most well studied is Rho Cassiopeiae;

152
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,117
a star so bright it can be seen with the 
naked eye although

153
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:35,508
it's thousands of lightyears from Earth.

154
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,769
At 40 solar masses,

155
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:41,270
this star is around 500 times the
radius of the Sun,

156
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,201
and 500,000 times brighter.

157
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:48,403
If the Earth were as close to Rho 
Cassiopeiae as it is to the Sun

158
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:51,763
it'd be inside it and you would be very
dead.

159
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:55,678
Yellow hypergiants are very rare though.

160
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:57,169
Only 15 are known.

161
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:01,501
This means they're likely just a 
short-lived intermediate state

162
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:05,780
as a star grows or shrinks between
other phases of hypergiantness.

163
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,421
With red hypergiants we reach the
largest stars known to us.

164
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:14,112
Probably the largest stars even possible!

165
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,555
So who's the winner of this insane
contest?

166
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,910
Well the truth is we don't know.

167
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,665
Red hypergiants are extremely bright
and far away

168
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:28,915
which means the even tiny
uncertainties in our measurements

169
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:31,886
can give us a huge margin of error for
their size.

170
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:36,758
Worse still are solar system sized
behemoths

171
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,464
that are blowing themselves apart

172
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,225
which makes them harder to measure.

173
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,158
As we do more science and our
instruments improve

174
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,710
whatever the largest star is will change.

175
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:50,966
The star that is currently thought to
be among the largest we've found

176
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,856
is Stephenson 2-18.

177
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,605
It was probably as a main sequence
star a few tens

178
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,172
of times the mass of the sun

179
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,863
and has likely lost about half its mass
by now.

180
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:06,344
While typical red hypergiants are 1500
times the size of the Sun,

181
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:13,389
the largest rough estimate places
Stephenson 2-18 at 2150 solar radii,

182
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,657
and shining with almost half a million
times the power of the Sun!

183
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,987
By comparison the Sun seems like a
grain of dust.

184
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:26,289
Our brains don't really have a way of
grasping this kind of scale.

185
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:31,788
Even at lightspeed it would take you 
8.7 hours to travel around it once.

186
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:35,745
The fastest plane on Earth would take
around 500 years!

187
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:40,279
Dropped on the Sun it would fill
Saturn's orbit!

188
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:44,154
As it evolves it would probably shed
even more mass

189
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:47,760
and shrink down into another hotter
hypergiant phase,

190
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,210
accumulate heavy elements in its core,

191
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,383
before finally exploding in a core
collapse supernova,

192
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:56,761
giving its gas back to the galaxy.

193
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:00,599
This gas will then go on to form
another generation

194
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,532
of stars of all sizes.

195
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,828
Starting the cycle of birth and death
again

196
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:07,898
to light up our universe.

197
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:10,742
Let's make this journey again

198
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:12,783
but this time without the talking.

199
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:14,862
The universe is BIG.

200
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:17,115
There are many large things in it.

201
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,800
If you want to play a bit more with size
stuff

202
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,526
we have good news!

203
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,517
We've crated our first app, Universe In
A Nutshell,

204
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,681
together with Tim Urban, the brain
behind Wait But Why.

205
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:51,116
You can seamlessly travel from the
smallest things in existence,

206
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:52,537
past the coronavirus,

207
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,436
human cells and dinosaurs,

208
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:57,125
all the way to the largest stars
and galaxies,

209
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,430
and marvel at the whole observable
universe!

210
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:03,047
You can learn more about each object,

211
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:06,183
or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all.

212
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:09,547
The app is inspired by the Scale Of
The Universe website

213
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,506
by the Huang twins,

214
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:13,347
that we spent a lot of time with when
it came out years ago,

215
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:15,466
and felt that it was finally time to
create a

216
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,822
Wait But Why and Kurzgesagt version.

217
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,515
You can get it in your app store,

218
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:21,916
there are no in-app purchases, and no ads.

219
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:24,393
All future updates are included.

220
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,641
And since this is our first app

221
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,279
we'd love to hear your feedback

222
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,105
so we can improve it over time.

223
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:31,833
If this sounds good to you

224
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,038
download the Universe In A Nutshell
app now

225
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:36,744
and leave us a 5-star review if you
want to support it.

226
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:41,379
Kurzgesagt and all the projects we do
are mostly funded by viewers

227
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,051
like you!

228
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:46,774
So if you like the app we'll make more
digital things in future.

229
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:48,612
Thank you for watching!
