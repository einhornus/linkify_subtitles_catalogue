1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,839
The night sky seems peaceful and orderly. But in 
reality, stars are careening through the galaxy at  

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,359
speeds of hundreds of thousands of kilometers 
per hour. Not bound by static formations but  

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,959
changing neighborhoods constantly. Fortunately 
space is big, and so the stars of the Milky Way  

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,999
are very unlikely to hit us. Unfortunately, 
they don’t have to hit anything to make us  

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:38,479
have a really bad time on earth. And there 
are already stars starting to get very close.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,199
To understand how dangerous stars are 
to us, we need to talk about gravity.  

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,839
Gravity attracts every piece of matter to 
every other piece of matter in the universe.  

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,239
You are attracted by an atom a million 
light years away and vice versa.  

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,919
Luckily, this force gets weaker over distance 
and it also depends on how massive something is.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,919
So things that are close and are very 
massive are more attractive, winning  

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,559
the cosmic tug-of-war. This way, massive things 
define how smaller things behave around them.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,039
The sun makes up 99.75% of all the mass in the 
solar system and so it shapes the behaviour and  

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,159
orbits of everything else in it. Billions of 
years ago, after the sun was born the solar  

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,999
system was a chaotic and dangerous place 
as the planets were formed from countless  

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,439
little pieces that collided constantly. But 
over the eons, a stable balance emerged.  

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,479
Today most planets and asteroids have 
settled into safe and predictable orbits.  

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,399
We have the inner and outer planets, 
the asteroid and kuiper belt.  

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,879
And at the edge, the Oort cloud, a giant sphere 
of comets orbiting slowly in cold storage.

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,799
We really don’t want this balance to be disturbed.

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,519
If another star came too close to us, it’s gravity 
would pull on everything in the solar system  

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,599
like a spoiled toddler, messing up the pleasant 
order of the planets and asteroids and comets.

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,839
This isn’t some imaginary 
danger. Some 70,000 years ago,  

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,439
a red dwarf, brown dwarf binary system, passed 
through the Oort cloud and messed things up.  

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,319
It might even have sent a deadly onslaught 
of asteroids our way. But, it could take two  

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,439
million years until those visitors from the 
Oort cloud arrive in the inner solar system.

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,719
But there’s a much bigger problem on the 
horizon: Gliese 710, a red dwarf with about  

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,919
half the mass of the sun, is currently headed 
towards the solar system. In about a million  

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,439
years it’ll pass through the Oort cloud and 
become the brightest star in the night sky.

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,519
A close flyby like this would unfold 
over hundreds of thousands of years,  

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,119
disrupting the orbits of millions of objects in 
the Oort cloud considerably. If we are unlucky,  

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,399
it will trigger a new period of planetary 
bombardment, similar to the early solar system.  

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,919
The night sky could be filled with comets and 
asteroids raining down on the inner solar system.  

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,239
The larger ones could cause Dinosaur level mass 
extinctions and would be bad for the stock market.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,919
But it could get much worse. The galaxy is 
an intense place and stars get close to each  

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,119
other regularly. So it is possible that a 
star could come much closer and not just  

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,399
pass us but fly directly through the inner solar 
system. This would be very bad in the extreme.

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,719
The chance of another star colliding 
with the sun is astronomically unlikely,  

38
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,679
but that isn’t what we’re worried about. 
If another star were to pass by about as  

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,879
close as the earth is from the sun, it could 
easily eject the earth from the solar system.  

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,199
The odds of such an event are 
estimated to be around 1/100,000  

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,079
in the next five billion years. Small, but not 
absurdly so. As we discussed in another video,  

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,119
there seem to be billions of rogue planets, doing 
their own thing in the galaxy and this is one way  

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,759
to make them. So if this were to happen with an 
average red dwarf, what would happen on earth?

44
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,639
Kicking Earth out of the Solar System

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,319
As the star enters the solar system a small 
orangish dot appears in the sky that grows bigger  

46
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,519
and brighter for months, eventually becoming 
visible during the day. It would get bigger and  

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,518
much brighter than the moon. Too bright to look 
at directly. The night sky would be filled with  

48
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,239
an eerie red glow. After a few months it would 
start shrinking again. But so would the sun.  

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,239
Over a few years, the sun slowly grows smaller 
in the sky, and with it warmth and light start to  

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,519
dissipate. All around the world, as the days turn 
dark, the final winter of humanity would begin.

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,159
The polar ice caps begin to grow and spread 
while plants shrivel and die. Forrests freeze and  

52
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,079
animals die in droves. As the earth passes the 
orbit of Mars the average surface temperature  

53
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,719
has plummeted to near -50 C. From space, 
earth begins to look like an icy moon,  

54
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,759
the blue-green surface becoming 
the pale grey-white of death.

55
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,319
As global infrastructure breaks down, people 
huddle together indoors, burning what they  

56
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,119
can for warmth as the temperature continues to 
drop, counting the days until they’ll be out of  

57
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,999
food which no longer grows. Everybody living 
at the surface is living on borrowed time.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,719
By the time earth reaches Jupiter’s orbit surface 
temperatures sink to -150 C, lower than the  

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:33,119
coldest ever recorded temperatures in Antarctica. 
Needless to say by now almost everyone is dead.

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,239
Without the energy from sunlight to evaporate 
water, clouds don’t form and the water cycle  

61
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,239
stops. The polar ice caps eventually touch at the 
equator, and the oceans become covered in a thick  

62
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,159
layer of ice. As more and more of its heat leaks 
out more water freezes onto the bottom of the ice  

63
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,399
sheet; the concentration of salt in the deep ocean 
grows, poisoning most animals that survived here.  

64
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,519
Although around hydrothermal vents communities 
of extremophiles might adapt even to these  

65
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,599
circumstances. Deep below the surface some 
bacteria would not notice much of any of this,  

66
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,799
as they are still kept warm by the radioactive 
decay of elements in the earth’s core.

67
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,959
As the earth reaches the orbit of Pluto 
and the Kuiper belt the sun is still the  

68
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,879
brightest star in the sky, but it is one among 
many, with stars now visible during the day.  

69
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,879
The temperature is now barely 
40 C above absolute zero,  

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,199
below the freezing temperature 
of the gasses in the atmosphere.

71
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,319
A weird spectacle, enjoyed by no one 
unfortunately, unfolds as the atmosphere  

72
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:43,119
turns into Nitrogen and then oxygen snow. Over 
a few years it is deposited into an icy 10 meter  

73
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,479
thick sheet all over the planet’s surface, 
with only a thin whisper of gas remaining.  

74
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,479
The frozen corpses of flora and 
fauna are buried beneath them.

75
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,719
As earth leaves the solar system 
it becomes a rogue planet.  

76
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,559
Traveling alone through the 
dark. Lifeless and in solitude.

77
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,759
But weirdly enough, there is hope.

78
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,479
Humanity would not be surprised by this 
potential extinction event. We’d notice it  

79
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,359
thousands of years in advance. There is not a lot 
we could do to stop a star. But we could prepare.

80
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,559
Most of us would perish. But a few million 
could survive in huge artificial complexes,  

81
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,119
powered by geothermal and nuclear energy, 
possibly even fusion if we can learn to  

82
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,759
use the ice around us for power. Here humanity 
might survive for hundreds of thousands of years.  

83
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,399
At some point we would become used to our 
circumstances and new generations would watch  

84
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,039
documentaries in disbelief, about the time we had 
our own star and could walk the surface of earth.

85
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,919
And at some point we might decide to look for 
another home. If the earth were lucky enough  

86
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,279
to pass by another star with a habitable planet, 
we could try to make a fresh start. Spaceflight,  

87
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,879
oddly enough, would become very easy without the 
atmosphere in the way. So it’s not unthinkable  

88
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,119
that the last survivors would leave earth behind 
and try again on a new planet, around a new star.

89
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,159
Maybe one day, thousands of years later, the 
descendants of humanity will tell legends  

90
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,239
about earth’s ancient past. Stories 
of our lost home. Of a mysterious  

91
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,600
icy planet, floating alone and 
empty through the dark of space.
