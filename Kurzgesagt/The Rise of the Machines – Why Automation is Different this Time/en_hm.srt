1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,284
How long do
you think it will take

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:06,999
before machines do your
job better than you do?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,719
Automation used to mean big stupid machines
doing repetitive work in factories.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,619
Today they can land aircraft,
diagnose cancer and trade stocks.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,259
We are entering a new age of automation
unlike anything that's come before.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,550
According to a 2013 study,
almost half of all jobs in the

7
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:28,599
US could potentially be automated
in the next two decades.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,759
But wait; Hasn't automation
been around for decades?

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:46,759
What's different this time?

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,019
Things used to be simple.

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,559
Innovation made human work
easier and productivity rose.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,500
Which means that more staff
or services could be produced

13
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:58,759
per hour using the same
amount of human workers.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,728
This eliminated many jobs, but also
created other jobs that were better

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,779
which was important because the
growing population needed work.

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,759
So, in a nutshell, innovation,
higher productivity,

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,199
fewer old jobs, and many
new and often better jobs.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,099
Overall, this worked well for a majority
of people and living standards improved.

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,083
There's a clear progression in
terms of what humans did for

20
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,599
a living. For the longest time,
we worked in agriculture.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,879
With the Industrial Revolution, this
shift into production jobs and as

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,119
automation became more widespread,
humans shifted into service jobs.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,779
And then only a few moments ago in human
history, the Information Age happened.

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,588
Suddenly, the rules were different.
Our jobs are now being

25
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:49,279
taken over by machines much faster
than they were in the past.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,359
That's worrying of course... but
innovation will clearly save us, right?

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,964
While new information age
industries are booming,

28
00:01:56,965 --> 00:02:00,739
they are creating fewer
and fewer new jobs.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,612
In 1979, General Motors
employed more than 800,000

30
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:08,179
workers and made about
$11 billion US dollars.

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:15,199
In 2012, Google made about $14 billion US
dollars while employing 58,000 people.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,659
You may not like this
comparison, but Google is

33
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,459
an example of what created
new jobs in the past:

34
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,119
Innovative new industries.

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,799
Old innovative industries are running
out of steam. Just look at cars.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,499
When they became a thing 100 years
ago, they created huge industries.

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,379
Cars transformed our way of life,
our infrastructure, and our cities.

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,648
Millions of people found jobs
either directly or indirectly.

39
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:44,839
Decades of investment
kept this momentum going.

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,346
Today, this process is largely complete.
Innovation in the

41
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:52,159
car industry does not create
as many jobs as it used to.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,759
While electric cars are great and all,
they won't create millions of new jobs.

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,076
But wait; what about the internet?

44
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:02,647
Some technologists argue
that the Internet is an

45
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:06,750
innovation on a par of the
introduction of electricity.

46
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:09,166
If we go with this
comparison, we see how our

47
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,567
modern innovation differs
from the old one.

48
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,833
The Internet created
new industries,

49
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,931
but they're not creating
enough jobs to keep up

50
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:20,447
with population growth or to compensate for
the industries the Internet is killing.

51
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,510
At its peak in 2004,

52
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:28,098
Blockbuster had 84,000 employees and
made $6 billion US dollars in revenue.

53
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:35,009
In 2016, Netflix had 4,500 employees and
made $9 billion dollars in revenue.

54
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,554
Or take us, for example.

55
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:41,681
With a full-time team of just 12 people,
Kurzgesagt reaches millions of people.

56
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:46,376
A TV station with the same amount
of viewers needs way more employees.

57
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:48,987
Innovation in the Information
Age doesn't equate to

58
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:51,553
the creation of enough new
jobs, which would be bad

59
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:55,243
enough on its own but now, a
new wave of automation and

60
00:03:55,244 --> 00:04:03,679
a new generation of machines
is slowly taking over.

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,885
To understand this, we need to
understand ourselves first.

62
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:10,734
Human progress is based
on the division of labor.

63
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:16,393
As we advanced over thousands of years,
our jobs became more and more specialized.

64
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:20,220
While even our smartest machines
are bad at doing complicated jobs,

65
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:25,494
they are extremely good at doing narrowly defined and predictable tasks.

66
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:28,332
This is what destroyed factory jobs.

67
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,940
But look at a complex job
long and hard enough,

68
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:33,684
and you'll find that it's
really just many narrowly

69
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:37,499
defined and predictable
tasks one after another.

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,906
Machines are on the brink
of becoming so good at

71
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:42,786
breaking down complex jobs
into many predictable ones,

72
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:46,922
that for a lot of people, there will be
no further room to specialize.

73
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:51,229
We are on the verge of being outcompeted.

74
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,785
Digital machines do this
via machine learning,

75
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:58,374
which enables them to acquire
information and skills by analyzing data.

76
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:02,092
This makes them become better at something
through the relationships they discover.

77
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,516
Machines teach themselves.

78
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:07,200
We make this possible by
giving a computer a lot of

79
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:10,213
data about the thing we
wanted to become better at.

80
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:12,941
Show a machine
all the things you bought online,

81
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:18,189
and it will slowly learn what to recommend
to you, so you buy more things.

82
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,205
Machine learning is now meeting more
of its potential because in recent years,

83
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:26,737
humans have started to
gather data about everything.

84
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:31,878
Behavior, weather patterns, medical
records, communication systems,

85
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:36,872
travel data, and of course,
data about what we do at work.

86
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:40,646
What we've created by accident
is a huge library machines can

87
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:45,283
use to learn how humans do things
and learn to do them better.

88
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:48,628
These digital machines might
be the biggest job killer of all.

89
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:52,152
They can be replicated
instantly and for free.

90
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:54,522
When they improve, you
don't need to invest in

91
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:58,169
big metal things; you can
just use the new code.

92
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,205
And they have the ability to
get better fast. How fast?

93
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:07,351
If your work involves complex work on
a computer today, you might be out

94
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:11,424
of work even sooner than the people
who still have jobs in factories.

95
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:17,039
There are actual real-world examples of
how this transition might be happening.

96
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,134
A San Francisco company offers a
project management software for big

97
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:25,197
corporations, which is supposed to
eliminate middle management positions.

98
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:28,882
When it's hired for a new project, the
software first decides which jobs

99
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:34,189
can be automated and precisely where
it needs actual professional humans.

100
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,005
It then helps assemble a team of
freelancers over the Internet.

101
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:41,978
The software then distributes tasks to
the humans, and controls the quality

102
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:46,851
of the work, tracking individual
performance until the project is complete.

103
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:49,266
Okay. This doesn't sound too bad.

104
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:54,126
While this machine is killing one job,
it creates jobs for freelancers, right?

105
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,163
Well, as the freelancers
complete their tasks,

106
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:59,873
learning algorithms track
them, and gather data

107
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:03,184
about their work, and which
tasks it consists of.

108
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:04,880
So what's actually happening, is that

109
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:08,617
the freelancers are teaching
a machine how to replace them.

110
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:12,063
On average, this software
reduces costs by about 50%

111
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:16,311
in the first year, and by
another 25% in the second year.

112
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:19,846
This is only one example of many.

113
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,219
There are machines and
programs getting as good

114
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,316
or better than humans
in all kinds of fields.

115
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:29,263
From pharmacists to analysts,
journalists to radiologists,

116
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:34,021
cashiers to bank tellers, or the
unskilled worker flipping burgers.

117
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,503
All of these jobs won't
disappear overnight,

118
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:39,730
but fewer and fewer humans
will be doing them.

119
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:42,943
We'll discuss a few cases
in a follow-up video.

120
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:52,332
But while jobs disappearing is
bad, it's only half of the story.

121
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,561
It's not enough to
substitute old jobs with new ones.

122
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,902
We need to be generating
new jobs constantly

123
00:07:57,903 --> 00:08:00,380
because the world
population is growing.

124
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,497
In the past we have solved
this through innovation.

125
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:09,293
But, since 1973, the generation of new
jobs in the US has begun to shrink.

126
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:12,688
And the first decade of the 21st
century, was the first one, where

127
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,408
the total amount of jobs in the US,
did not grow for the first time.

128
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:21,513
In a country that needs to create
up to 150,000 new jobs per

129
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:26,822
month, just to keep up with
population growth, this is bad news.

130
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:30,118
This is also starting to
affect standards of living.

131
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,889
In the past, it was seen as
obvious that with rising

132
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,567
productivity, more and better
jobs would be created.

133
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,080
But the numbers
tell a different story.

134
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:45,206
In 1998, US workers worked
a total of 194 billion hours.

135
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:50,428
Over the course of the next 15 years,
their output increased by 42 percent.

136
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:58,126
But in 2013, the amount of hours worked
by US workers was still 194 billion hours.

137
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:01,223
What this means, is that
despite productivity growing

138
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:04,694
drastically, thousands of new
businesses opening up, and the

139
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:08,006
US population growing by over
40 million, there was no

140
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:12,316
growth at all in the number
of hours worked in 15 years.

141
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:15,499
At the same time, wages for
new university graduates

142
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,199
in the US, have been declining
for the past decade,

143
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,388
while up to 40 percent of
new graduates, are forced

144
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:29,810
to take on jobs that
don't require a degree.

145
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:33,131
Productivity is separating
from human labor.

146
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:35,834
The nature of innovation
in the Information Age is

147
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:38,678
different from everything
we've encountered before.

148
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,464
This process started years ago
and is already well underway.

149
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:49,026
Even without new disruptions like
self-driving cars, or robot accountants.

150
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:52,023
It looks like
automation is different this time.

151
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:56,157
This time, the machines
might really take our jobs.

152
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:59,403
Our economies are based on
the premise that people consume.

153
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:04,404
But if fewer and fewer people have decent
work, who will be doing all the consuming?

154
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:08,058
Are we producing ever more cheaply
only to arrive at a point where

155
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:12,437
too few people can actually buy
all our stuff and services?

156
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:17,185
Or, will the future see a tiny minority of
the super rich who own the machines...

157
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:18,899
dominating the rest of us?

158
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,443
And does our future
really have to be that grim?

159
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:24,969
While we were fairly dark
in this video, it's far

160
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,689
from certain that things
will turn out negatively.

161
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,404
The Information Age and modern
automation, could be a huge opportunity

162
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:36,338
to change human society, and reduce
poverty and inequality drastically.

163
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,509
It could be a seminal
moment in human history.

164
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,221
We'll talk about this potential,
and possible solutions like

165
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:46,865
a universal basic income, in
part 2 of this video series.

166
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,535
We need to think big, and fast.

167
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:53,495
Because one thing's for
sure, the machines are not coming;

168
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:57,385
They are already here.

169
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,577
This video took us
about 900 hours to make,

170
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:02,309
and we've been working on
it for over nine months.

171
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,129
Projects like this one
would not be possible

172
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,457
without your support
on patreon.com.

173
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,236
If you want to help us
out and get a personal

174
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:11,751
Kurzgesagt bird in return,
that would be really useful.

175
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:15,585
We based much of this video on
two very good books:

176
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,596
and

177
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:21,692
You can find links to both of them in the
video description; highly recommended!

178
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:23,741
Also, we made a little robot poster.

179
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:28,167
You can buy it and a lot of other
stuff in our DFTBA shop.

180
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:31,089
This video is part of a larger
series about how technology

181
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,332
is already changing and will
change human life forever.

182
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,833
