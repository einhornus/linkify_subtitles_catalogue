00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:08,118
If you saw a wormhole in reality, it would appear round, spherical, a bit like a black hole.

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,659
Light from the other side passes through and gives you a window to a faraway place.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:21,319
Once crossed, the other side comes fully into view with your old home now receding into that shimmering spherical window.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,119
But are wormholes real,

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,299
or are they just magic disguised as physics and maths?

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,919
If they are real, how do they work and where can we find them?

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:41,279
[Kurzgesagt Intro]

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,779
For most of human history,

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,019
we thought space was pretty simple; a big flat stage where the events of the universe unfold.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,179
Even if you take down the set of planets and stars, there's still something left.

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,719
That empty stage is space and it exists,

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,059
unchanging and eternal.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,759
Einstein's theory of relativity changed that.

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,559
It says that space and time make up that stage together, and they aren't the same everywhere.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,019
The things on the stage can affect the stage itself, stretching and warping it.

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,739
If the old stage was like unmoving hardwood, Einstein's stage is more like a waterbed.

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:31,059
This kind of elastic space can be bent and maybe even torn and patched together, which could make wormholes possible.

18
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,719
Let's see what that would look like in 2D.

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,319
Our universe is like a big flat sheet, bent in just the right way,

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,279
wormholes could connect two very, very distant spots with a short bridge

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,919
that you could cross almost instantaneously.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,659
Enabling you to travel the universe even faster than the speed of light.

23
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,479
So, where can we find a wormhole?

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,999
Presently, only on paper.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,559
General relativity says they might be possible, but that doesn't mean they have to exist.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,059
General relativity is a mathematical theory.

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,538
It's a set of equations that have many possible answers, but not all maths describes reality.

28
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,059
But they are theoretically possible and there are different kinds.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,759
EINSTEIN ROSEN BRIDGES

30
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,399
The first kind of wormholes to be theorized were Einstein Rosen Bridges.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,239
They describe every black hole as a sort of portal to an infinite parallel universe.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,619
Let's try to picture them in 2D again.

33
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,379
Empty space time is flat,

34
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,759
but curved by objects on it.

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,439
If we compress that object, space-time gets more curved around it.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,599
Eventually, space-time becomes so warped that it has no choice but to collapse into a black hole.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,219
A one-way barrier forms: the event horizon, which anything can enter but nothing can escape;

38
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,759
trapped forever at the singularity at its core.

39
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,619
But maybe there is no singularity here.

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,979
One possibility is that the other side of the event horizon looks a bit like our universe again

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,519
but mirrored upside down, where time runs backwards.

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,299
In our universe things fall into the black hole.

43
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,799
In the parallel universe, with backwards time,

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,959
the mirror black hole is spewing things out a bit like a big bang.

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,139
This is called a white hole.

46
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,639
Unfortunately, Einstein-rosen bridges can't actually be crossed.

47
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,559
It takes an infinite amount of time to cross over to the opposite universe and they crimp shut in the middle.

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,979
If you go into a black hole, you won't become the stuff coming out of the white hole.

49
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,079
You'll only become dead.

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,259
So, to travel the cosmos in the blink of an eye, humans need a different kind of wormhole;

51
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,659
a Traversable Wormhole.

52
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,879
VERY OLD STRING THEORY WORMHOLES

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,359
If string theory or one of its variations is the correct description of our universe,

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,959
then we could be lucky and our universe might even have a tangled web of countless wormholes already.

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,519
Shortly after the Big Bang,

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,839
Quantum fluctuations in the universe at the smallest scales

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,699
far far smaller than an atom may have created many, many

58
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,819
traversable wormholes.

59
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,599
Threaded through them are strings, called cosmic strings.

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:22,159
In the first billionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the ends of these tiny, tiny wormholes were pulled light-years apart;

61
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,599
scattering them through the universe.

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,839
If wormholes were made in the early universe,

63
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,399
whether with cosmic strings or some other way, they could be all over; just waiting to be discovered.

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,819
One might even be closer than we realize.

65
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,459
From the outside, black holes and wormholes can look very similar;

66
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,299
leading some physicists to suggest the supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies are actually wormholes.

67
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,139
It will be very hard to go all the way to the center of the Milky Way to find out though, but that's okay.

68
00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:00,159
There might be an equally extremely hard way to get our hands on a wormhole, we could try to make one.

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,719
MANMADE WORMHOLES

70
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,019
To be traversable and useful, there are a few properties

71
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,099
we want a wormhole to have.

72
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,219
First, it must obviously connect to distant parts of space-time.

73
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,359
Like your bedroom and the bathroom,

74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,639
or Earth and Jupiter.

75
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,879
Second, it should not contain any event horizons, which would block two-way travel.

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,099
Third, it should be sufficiently sized so that the gravitational forces don't kill human travelers.

77
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,159
The biggest problem we have to solve, is keeping our wormholes open.

78
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,319
No matter how we make wormholes, gravity tries to close them.

79
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,859
Gravity wants to pinch it closed and cut the bridge; leaving only black holes at the ends.

80
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,049
Whether it's a traversable wormhole with both ends in ours, or a wormhole to another universe,

81
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,138
it will try to close unless we have something propping it open.

82
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,699
For very old string theory wormholes, that's the cosmic strings job.

83
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,619
For man-made wormholes, We need a new ingredient.

84
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,559
Exotic matter.

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,139
This isn't anything like we find on earth, or even antimatter.

86
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:14,619
It's something totally new and different and exciting, with crazy properties like nothing that's ever been seen before.

87
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,139
Exotic matter is stuff that has a negative mass.

88
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,879
Positive mass like people and planets and everything else in the universe, is attractive because of gravity.

89
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,659
But negative mass would be repulsive; it would push you away.

90
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,539
This makes a kind of anti-gravity the props open our wormholes.

91
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:41,039
And exotic matter must exert enormous pressure to push space-time open, greater even than the pressure of the centers of neutron stars.

92
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,839
With exotic matter, we could weave space-time however we see fit.

93
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,059
We may even have a candidate for this exotic matter, the vacuum of space itself.

94
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,599
Quantum fluctuations in empty space are constantly creating pairs of particles and antiparticles,

95
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,979
only for them to be annihilated an instant later.

96
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:10,779
The vacuum of space is boiling with them, and we can already manipulate them to produce an effect similar to the negative mass we're looking for.

97
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,919
We could use this to stabilize our wormholes.

98
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,939
Once we're keeping it open, the ends would start together. So, we'd have to move them around to interesting places.

99
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,219
We could start by wiring the solar system; leaving one end of each wormhole in orbit around the earth.

100
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,759
We could flick others into deep space.

101
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:37,359
The earth could be a wormhole hub for a vast interstellar human civilization spread over light-years,

102
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,259
but only a wormhole away.

103
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,059
However, wormholes have a dark side.

104
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:50,599
Even opening a single wormhole, kind-of breaks the universe in fundamental ways, potentially creating time travel paradoxes,

105
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,579
and violating the causal structure of the universe.

106
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:02,499
Many scientists think that this not only means they should be impossible to make, but that it's impossible for them to exist at all.

107
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,899
So, for now, we only know that wormholes exist in our hearts, and on paper in the form of equations.

108
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,819
We know you want to know more about universe stuff, so, we're trying something new.

109
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,379
