1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,279
Do you think the European Union is worth it?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,119
Or, should we end it?

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,939
Many people feel a strong disconnect with the EU, while others praise its achievements.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:27,359
Everything considered: Is its existence good or bad for Europeans?

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,559
Since it looks like the UK is leaving the EU, we'll mostly treat it as if it's no longer part of the club.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:40,419
The European Union, combining its 27 member countries, has a population of about 450 million people,

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,519
making it the third most populous sort-of country in the world.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,159
It's the world's second largest economy by GDP, and has the biggest single market in the world.

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,659
But originally, the creation of the European Union was all about one thing: Peace.

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,599
Europeans are really good at war,

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,219
so they were involved in bloody conflicts for basically all their history.

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,719
A century-long rivalry between Germany and France

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,739
alone, cost millions of lives and ran so deeply

14
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,679
that Germans invented their own word for it:

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,079
Erbfeindschaft.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,759
After the second World War, Europeans decided

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,039
they wanted lasting peace that was not

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,159
based on a balance of military power.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,739
Instead, the economies, politics, and peoples of Europe,

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,639
should become so closely interconnected, that war

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,199
would become both impractical and unthinkable.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,799
The plan worked!

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,799
Between EU members, we've had over 70 years of peace.

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,479
Okay, peace is great and all, but what are the

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,199
European Union's achievements and problems?

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,319
Today, EU citizens benefit from many individual freedoms.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,579
EU treaties and regulations

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,499
ensure easy travel,

29
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,019
cheap telecommunications,

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,659
a great variety of goods and services, as well as very

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,959
strong health and safety standards.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,099
European institutions are not afraid to

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,519
pick a fight with companies such as

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,069
Microsoft, Apple or Facebook about fair

35
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,659
competition, tax evasion or data protection.

36
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,759
Through the EU science programs, the European countries

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,899
became a collaborative engine that serves

38
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,859
as a hub of science in the wider world.

39
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,539
Unrestricted travel and the right to

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,399
work anywhere makes it easy to apply for

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,799
funds, and set up international teams of

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,419
experts with the best equipment.

43
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,999
In turn, the EU became the world leader in terms

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,529
of its global share of science

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,539
researchers, and produces more than

46
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,979
twenty-five percent of the world's

47
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,079
research output, with only five percent

48
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,439
of its population.

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,799
But many citizens feel distrust toward the EU.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,819
Brussels seems far away and untransparent, technocratic,

51
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,839
and difficult to understand.

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,239
It doesn't help that the EU is terrible at outreach,

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,239
and explaining what it actually does.

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,659
This disconnect has also led to an ever-shrinking

55
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,619
voter turnout over the decades.

56
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,988
More transparency and accountability are

57
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:04,059
desperately needed if the EU

58
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,559
institutions want the trust of their citizens.

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,059
Currently, the EU is still

60
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,639
shaken by the refugee crisis of 2015.

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,319
Some countries have accepted far greater

62
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,029
numbers of asylum seekers than others,

63
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,649
while the border countries are

64
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,819
overwhelmed and feel left alone.

65
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,839
Other countries are shocked by the initially

66
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,419
unregulated mass immigration, and closed

67
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,459
their borders, effectively shutting down

68
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,279
the largest route into Europe.

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,859
The EU's wealth and freedom make it an

70
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,899
attractive destination, and this is

71
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,359
unlikely to change.

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,879
The population is split on how to react to that.

73
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,939
Some argue that Europe let in too many immigrants,

74
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,289
with a different culture without

75
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,539
strictly demanding integration, while

76
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,518
others argue that immigration is not the

77
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,289
problem, but that racism and

78
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,969
discrimination of immigrants is

79
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,479
preventing integration.

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,779
To strike a balance between helping refugees,

81
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,039
turning illegal immigrants away, and

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,419
successfully integrating the ones that stay,

83
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,039
remains one of the most difficult and

84
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,959
controversial challenges of the Union.

85
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,779
Immigration aside,  many more challenges

86
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,819
lie in the future, like defense.

87
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,639
Traditionally, European countries have

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,359
relied strongly on the protection of

89
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,739
the US through NATO.

90
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,398
But in the current political climate,

91
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,219
Europe has to ask itself if it really

92
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,319
wants to depend on the United States for its safety.

93
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,169
If combined today, the

94
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,029
militaries of EU members could form an

95
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,099
effective defensive force and be the

96
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,659
third largest military in the world.

97
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,629
That could save a lot of money, safeguard

98
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,119
European borders, and enhance cultural

99
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,369
understanding with soldiers from 27

100
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,859
different countries serving one common purpose.

101
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,339
What about money?

102
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,819
Well, it's complicated.

103
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,239
The EU created the largest

104
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,139
single market in the world.

105
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,219
Inside it, you can trade border and customs free.

106
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,859
Countries that entered it got a massive

107
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,139
boost to their economies. Even between

108
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,449
neighbors, trade increased by up to five

109
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,189
hundred percent, and there was a steady

110
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,739
creation of new jobs.

111
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,529
Research has suggested that joining the EU has left

112
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,089
Most new members with an average of

113
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,549
a twelve percent higher GDP than if

114
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,859
they had remained outside.

115
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,289
And for those regions with weaker economies and poor

116
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,749
infrastructure, EU institutions provide

117
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,059
billions of euros every year helping

118
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,119
economic investment, infrastructure,

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,099
and social development.

120
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,249
On the negative side, the EU tries to hold together countries

121
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,199
with vastly different economies and laws

122
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,239
regarding labor, taxes and social security.

123
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,799
The cost of one hour of work in

124
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,339
an EU country ranges from four euros an hour

125
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,659
to forty euros an hour.

126
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,259
Some countries have large industries and strong exports

127
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,879
while others focus on services, tourism, or natural resources.

128
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,969
On top of this, the

129
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,369
euro is the common currency of some but

130
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,499
not all of these countries.

131
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,519
As the Greek crisis shows, this can be a recipe for disaster.

132
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,879
You cannot unify a vastly

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,679
different economies under one currency,

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,459
but their economic policies separate.

135
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,219
So, should all EU countries

136
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,259
unite under the common currency, or not?

137
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,699
Should the weakest links be thrown out

138
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,009
of the Euro, or should countries be made

139
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,649
to adopt common policies on taxes, health

140
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,879
care, and social security?

141
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,479
It's a question that's been brewing for years, and is

142
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,539
nowhere near a solution.

143
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,239
So, everything briefly considered: Is the

144
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,599
European Union worth it?

145
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,959
Here is our answer:

146
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,288
The EU is very flawed, and still

147
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,269
needs a lot of work. But it's fair to say

148
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,099
that the European Union makes Europeans powerful in the world.

149
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,098
Put together, we

150
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,689
lead in science, are one of the strongest

151
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,059
economic powers, and could have one of

152
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,499
the strongest militaries in the world.

153
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,559
But more importantly, the EU gives us

154
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,499
peace, security, and a sense of shared identity.

155
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,959
And something we all crave

156
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,019
in these turbulent times, stability.

157
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,848
If we want to protect the values we're so

158
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,069
proud of, a strong European Union is the

159
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,049
best way to make sure our voice is heard

160
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,799
in the world.

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,769
Alone as small states, we'll

162
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,779
hardly stand a chance in a world of

163
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,999
shifting superpowers.

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,819
What do you think about the EU in its future?

165
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,319
In recent years, the discussion about political

166
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,619
topics has become super toxic with sad

167
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,559
real-world consequences.

168
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,979
Let's not do that.

169
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,159
If you don't agree with this video,

170
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,319
you're not our enemy, you just have a

171
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,538
different opinion and that's fine.

172
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,759
We're all in the same boat after all, so let's

173
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,680
have a fact-based discussion about our future.
