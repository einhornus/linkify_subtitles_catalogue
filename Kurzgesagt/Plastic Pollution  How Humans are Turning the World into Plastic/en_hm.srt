00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,659
When the gods granted king Midas one wish, he wished that everything he touched would turn to gold.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,489
Midas was delighted. Trees, rocks, buildings all gold.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,139
But soon he found in horror that his food turned into gold as well.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,159
When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain, he realized his mistake too late.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,319
The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken and alone.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,879
Humanity got a similar wish granted when we learned how to turn brown stinky goo into magic - plastic.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,859
Cheap, sterile and convenient it changed our lives

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,299
But this wonder of technology got a little out of hand.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,679
Plastic has saturated our environment.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,679
It has invaded the animals we eat and now it's finding its way into our bodies.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:05,098
[Catchy intro music]

12
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,179
What is plastic?

13
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,119
For most of our history humans used stuff we found in nature to build the things we needed.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,699
But the invention of plastic roughly 100 years ago completely changed our world.

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,919
Plastic is made from polymers - long repeating chains of molecule groups.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:31,859
In nature, polymers exist everywhere : the walls of cells, silk, hair, insect carapaces, DNA.

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,199
But it's also possible to create them.

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,839
By breaking down crude oil into its components and Rearranging them, we can form new synthetic polymers.

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,799
Synthetic polymers have extraordinary traits.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,419
They are lightweight, durable and can be molded into almost any shape.

21
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,559
Not requiring time-consuming manual work, plastic can be easily mass-produced

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,919
and its raw materials are a vailable in vast amounts

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,819
And incredibly cheaply, and so the golden era of plastics began

24
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:11,109
Bakelite was used for mechanical parts, PVC for plumbing electric gears and cases,

25
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,339
Acrylic is a shatter resistant alternative to glass and nylon for stockings and war equipment

26
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,919
Today almost everything is at least partly made from plastic.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,579
Our clothes, phones, computers, furniture, appliances, houses and cars.

28
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,779
Plastic has long ceased to be a revolutionary material instead it became trash.

29
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,299
Coffee cups, plastic bags, or stuff to wrap a banana. We don't think about this fact a lot.

30
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,359
Plastic just appears and goes away.

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,719
Unfortunately, it doesn't

32
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,619
Since synthetic polymers are so durable, plastic takes between 500 and 1,000 years to break down.

33
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:57,919
But somehow we collectively decided to use this super tough material for things meant to be thrown away.

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,719
40% of plastics are used for packaging.

35
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,819
In the United States, packaging makes up 1/3 of all the waste that is generated annually.

36
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,039
Since its invention, we have produced about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic.

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,079
335 million tons in 2016 alone.

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,229
More than 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic have become waste since 1907.

39
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:30,529
Piled up in one place, that makes a cube with a side length of 1.9 kilometers.

40
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,439
So what did we do with all this waste?

41
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,779
9% was recycled, 12% burnt.

42
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,279
But

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,189
79% of it is sticking around still.

44
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,089
A lot ends up in the ocean. Around 8 million tons a year.

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,919
That's so much plastic that it will outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050.

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,179
Because it's everywhere, marine animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it.

47
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,799
In 2015 already 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic.

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,619
Many animals starve with stomachs full of indigestible trash. In 2018 a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain.

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,898
He had eaten 32 kilos of plastic bags, nets and a drum

50
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,859
While this is tragic and makes for great magazine covers, there's an even more widespread,

51
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,339
invisible form of plastic.

52
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,579
Microplastics

53
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,639
Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 millimeters

54
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,699
Some of them are used in cosmetics or toothpaste,

55
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,179
but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation

56
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,719
And crumbles into smaller and smaller pieces

57
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,579
51 trillion such particles float in the ocean,

58
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,779
Where they are even more easily swallowed by all kinds of marine life.

59
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,459
This has raised concerns among scientists,

60
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,559
especially about health risks from the chemicals that are added to plastic.

61
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,699
BPA for example makes plastic bottles transparent

62
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,389
But there's also evidence that it interferes with our hormonal system. DEHP makes plastics more flexible,

63
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,499
But may cause cancer.

64
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,579
It would be pretty bad if micro plastics are toxic, because they travel up the food chain.

65
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,659
Zooplankton eat micro plastic. Small fish eat zooplankton.

66
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,739
So do oysters, crabs and predatory fish and they all land on our plate.

67
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:34,939
Micro plastics have been found in honey, in sea salt, in beer, in tap water and in the household dust around us.

68
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,039
8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,059
have measurable amounts of phthalates, a common plastic additive in their bodies.

70
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,819
And 93% of people have BPA in their urine

71
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,559
There is little science about this so far and right now it's inconclusive.

72
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,919
We need a lot more research before panic is justified.

73
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,519
But it is safe to say that a lot of stuff happened that we didn't plan for. And we have lost control

74
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,819
Over plastic to a certain extent which is kind of scary.

75
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,719
But just to make sure we should simply ban plastics, right?

76
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,679
Unfortunately, it's a bit more complicated than that.

77
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,199
Plastic pollution is not the only environmental challenge we face.

78
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,079
Some of the substitutes we'd use for plastic have a higher environmental impact in other ways.

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,009
For example :

80
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,679
according to a recent study by the Danish government,

81
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,479
making a single-use plastic bag requires so little energy and produces far lower carbon dioxide emissions

82
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,779
compared to a reusable cotton bag, that you need to use your cotton bag 7 thousand 100 times

83
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,759
before it would have a lower impact on the environment than the plastic bag.

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,499
We're left with a complex process of trade-offs. Everything has an impact somehow,

85
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,899
and it's hard to find the right balance between them.

86
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,719
Plastic also helps solve problems that we don't have very good answers for at the moment.

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,619
Globally, one-third of all food that's produced is never eaten and ends up rotting away on landfills where it produces methane.

88
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,219
And the best way of preventing food from spoiling and avoiding unnecessary waste is still plastic packaging.

89
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,099
It's also important to note where the vast majority of the world's plastic pollution is coming from right now.

90
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,379
90% of all plastic waste entering the ocean through rivers comes from just ten rivers in Asia and Africa.

91
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,979
The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5 million tons of plastic into the ocean each year.

92
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,159
Countries like China, India

93
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,119
Algeria or Indonesia

94
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,399
industrialized at an impressive pace in the last few decades,

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,059
transforming the lives of billions of people

96
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,199
This development was so fast,

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,319
that the garbage disposal infrastructure couldn't keep up with collecting and recycling all the new waste this brought

98
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,859
If politicians in Europe and the US want to address this issue,

99
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,939
investing in infrastructure in developing countries is just as important

100
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,399
as fighting plastic pollution at home with campaigns and redesigning products to minimize unnecessary

101
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,659
plastic production.

102
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:09,279
The bottom line is, as long as we don't address plastic pollution from a global perspective, we will not solve it.

103
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,579
Plastic pollution is a complicated problem.

104
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,939
We found a magic material and we had a really good time with it,

105
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:24,979
But we need to be careful or just like Midas, we'll end up in a world that we didn't wish for.

106
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:31,679
Your individual daily actions still have a huge impact. What you do matters!

107
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,918
Refuse disposable plastics. Convince your friends and family to do the same.

108
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:43,759
Pressure companies and politicians to take the necessary steps to keep our oceans clean and our food safe.

109
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,879
Together we can beat plastic pollution!

110
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,599
This video was a collaboration with UN Environment and their clean seas campaign.

111
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,460
