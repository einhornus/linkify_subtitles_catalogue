1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,259
An observable universe is a big place
that's been around for more than 13 billion years.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,119
Up to two trillion galaxies made up of
something like 20,000 billion billion stars

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,679
surround our home galaxy.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,079
In the Milky Way alone,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,399
scientists assume there are some
40 billion earth-like planets

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,319
in the habitable zone of their stars.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,079
When we look at these numbers, it's hard to imagine
that there is nobody else out there.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,259
It would change our perception of ourselves forever
if we found others.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,559
Just knowing that this vast place is not dead
would shift our perspective outward,

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,119
and could help us get over
our irrelevant quarrels.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,919
But before looking for our
new best friends, or worst enemies,

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,439
we have a problem to solve:
What are we actually looking for?

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,619
[Kurzgesagt intro]

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,259
In a universe that big and old,

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,719
we have to assume that civilizations
start millions of years apart from eachother,

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,839
and develop in different directions and speeds.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,359
So not only are we looking over distances of
dozens to hundreds of thousands of light years,

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,439
we're looking for a civilization
ranging from cavemen to super advanced.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,699
So, we need a conceptual framework
to enable us to think better thoughts

20
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,099
that make us able to search better.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,519
Are there universal rules that
intelligent species follow?

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,879
Currently our civilization sample size is only one,

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,439
so we may make incorrect assumptions
based solely on ourselves.

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,839
Still, better than nothing.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,039
We know that humans started out with nothing
but minds and hands that could build tools.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,299
We know that humans are curious, competitive,
greedy for resources, and expansionist.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,799
The more of these qualities our ancestors had,

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,759
the more successful they were
in the civilization building game.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,519
Being one with nature is nice,

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,639
but it's not the path
to irrigation systems, or gunpowder, or cities.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,279
So it's reasonable to assume that aliens able to
take over their home planet also have these qualities.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,639
And, if aliens have to follow
the same laws of physics,

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,399
then there is a measurable metric for progress:
Energy use.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,939
Human progress can be measured very precisely
by how much energy we extracted from our environment,

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,599
and how we made it
usable to do things.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,439
We started with muscles,
until we learned to control fire.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,679
Then we made machines that
used kinetic energy from water and wind.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,539
As our machines got better
and our knowledge of materials expanded,

39
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,719
we began to harness the concentrated energy
from dead plants we dug up from the ground.

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,239
As our energy consumption grew exponentially,
so did the abilities of our civilization.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,219
Between 1800 and 2015,
population size had increased sevenfold,

42
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,679
while humanity was consuming
25 times more energy.

43
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,279
It's likely that this process
will continue into the far future.

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,319
Based on these facts, scientist Nikolai Kardashev
developed a method of categorizing civilizations,

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,519
from cave dwellers to gods ruling over galaxies:

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,019
The Kardashev Scale;
a method of ranking civilizations by their energy use.

47
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,839
The scale has been refined and
expanded on over the decades,

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,359
but in general it puts civilizations
into four different categories.

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,799
A Type 1 civilization is able to use the
available energy of their home planet.

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,359
A Type 2 civilization is able to use the
available energy of their star and planetary system.

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,639
A Type 3 civilization is able to use the
available energy of their galaxy.

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,959
A Type 4 civilization is able to use the
available energy of multiple galaxies.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,239
These levels differ by orders of magnitude.

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,479
It's like comparing an ant colony
to a human metropolitan area.

55
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,359
To, ants we are so complex and powerful,
we might as well be gods.

56
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,439
So to make the scale more useful,
we need subcategories.

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,079
On the lower end of the spectrum,
there are Type 0 to Type 1 civilizations:

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,419
Anything from hunter-gatherers, to something
we could achieve in the next few hundred years.

59
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,019
These might actually be
abundant in the Milky Way.

60
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,699
But a civilization that is not
actively transmitting radio signals into space

61
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,959
might be as close as our nearest stellar neighbor,
the Alpha Centauri system,

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,599
and we would have no way of
realizing they exist.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,079
But even if they transmitted radio signals
like we do, it might not be very helpful.

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,839
On an interstellar scale,
humanity is practically invisible.

65
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,919
Our signals may extend over
an impressive 200 light years,

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,839
but this is only a tiny fraction
of the Milky Way.

67
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,999
And even if someone were listening,

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,399
after a few light years
our signals decay into noise,

69
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,439
impossible to identify as
the source of an intelligent species.

70
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,679
Today, humanity ranks at about level 0.75.

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,539
We have altered our planet:

72
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,879
we've created huge structures,
mined and stripped mountains,

73
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,799
removed rainforests, and drained swamps.

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,559
We've created rivers and lakes,

75
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,119
and changed the composition and temperature
 of the atmosphere.

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,899
If progress continues,
and we don't make Earth uninhabitable,

77
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,359
we will become a full Type 1 civilization
in the next few hundred years.

78
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,119
Any civilization that becomes a Type 1
is bound to look outside,

79
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,199
because it's likely that it's still curious,
competitive, greedy and expansionist.

80
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,319
The next reasonable step towards transitioning to Type 2
is trying to alter and mine other planets and bodies.

81
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,879
This might start with outposts in space,
transition to infrastructure and industries near the home planet,

82
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,079
move on to colonies,
and end with terraforming other planets,

83
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,499
by changing their atmosphere,
their rotation, or position.

84
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,279
As a civilization expands and
uses more and more stuff and space,

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,859
its energy consumption scales with them,

86
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,879
so at some point, they may embark on the largest project
a lower Type 2 civilization can take on:

87
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,439
harnessing the energy of their star
by building a Dyson Swarm.

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,379
Once this megastructure is finished,

89
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,039
energy has become practically unlimited
for molding the home system however they see fit.

90
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,939
If they are still curious, competitive,
greedy and expansionist,

91
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,999
and now have complete control
over their home system,

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,519
stellar infrastructure in place,
and the energy output of a star,

93
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,799
the next frontier moves to
other stars light years away.

94
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,479
For a Type 2 civilization,

95
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,959
the distance to other stars might feel like
the distance between Earth and Pluto does to us today:

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,239
Technically within reach,

97
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,519
but only with immense investments
in terms of time, ingenuity, and resources.

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,659
This begins their transition
towards Type 3.

99
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,619
This step is so far beyond us

100
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,519
that it becomes hard to imagine
what exactly these challenges will look like,

101
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,239
and how they'll be solved.

102
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,459
Will they be able to find a solution
to the vast distances

103
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,579
and travel times of
hundreds or thousands of years?

104
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,359
Will they be able to communicate and keep a shared
culture and biology between colonies light years apart?

105
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,939
Or will they split into
separate Type 2 civilizations?

106
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,679
Maybe even different species?

107
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,219
Are there deadly challenges between the stars?

108
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,739
So the closer a species gets to Type 3,

109
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,319
the harder it becomes to fathom
what it might actually look like.

110
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,559
They might discover new physics,
may understand and control dark matter and energy,

111
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,519
or be able to travel faster than light.

112
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,359
We might be unable to grasp their
motives, technology, and actions.

113
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,919
Humans are the ants, trying to
understand the galactic metropolitan area.

114
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,479
A high Type 2 civilization might already consider
humanity too primitive to even talk to.

115
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,399
A Type 3 civilization might feel about
as like we feel about the bacteria living on the anthill.

116
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,119
Maybe they wouldn't even consider us conscious,
or our survival relevant.

117
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,279
We could only pray that they're nice gods.

118
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,079
But the scale doesn't necessarily end here.

119
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,299
Some scientists suggest there might be
Type 4 and Type 5 civilizations,

120
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,139
whose influence stretches over
galaxy clusters or superclusters,

121
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,879
structures comprising thousands of galaxies
and trillions of stars.

122
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,419
Ultimately, there might be
a Type Omega civilization,

123
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,639
able to manipulate the entire universe,
and possibly others.

124
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,678
Type omega civilizations might be
the actual creators of our universe,

125
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,158
for reasons beyond our comprehension.

126
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,639
Maybe they were just bored.

127
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,919
As flawed as this classification may be,

128
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,039
this thought experiment is
already telling us interesting things.

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,699
If our ideas about the nature of species that
form interstellar civilizations is sort of correct,

130
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,279
then we can be pretty sure that there are
no civilizations of Type 3 and beyond near the Milky Way.

131
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,619
Their influence would in all likelihood
be so all-encompassing,

132
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,879
and their technology so far above our own,
that we couldn't miss them.

133
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,759
The galaxy should flash with their activity
in thousands of star systems.

134
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,799
We should be able to see or detect their artifacts or movements
between different parts of their empire.

135
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,379
Even if a Type 3 civilization did exist in the past,
and died a mysterious death,

136
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,439
we should be able to detect
some of the remnants of their empire.

137
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,719
But when scientists looked,
they didn't find remnants of harvested stars,

138
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,139
decaying megastructures
or scars of great interstellar wars.

139
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,559
So they're very likely not out there
and never were.

140
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,719
In a sense, this is very sad,
but also very reassuring.

141
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,599
It leaves the galaxy to us and
others similar to us.

142
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:01,159
So the most promising civilizations to look for may be
somewhere in the spectrum from Type 1.5 to Type 2.5.

143
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,359
They wouldn't be too advanced to
understand them and their motives.

144
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,759
They may have finished their first megastructures,

145
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,959
and they might be in the process of
moving staff between stars,

146
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,159
transmitting enormous amounts of information
into space,

147
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,639
by accident, or on purpose.

148
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,799
They would probably also look to the stars
and look for others.

149
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,359
Then again, maybe we've got it all wrong.

150
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,559
Maybe progress to Type 2
does not mean expanding outwards,

151
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,719
and humanity is still too immature
to imagine otherwise.

152
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,799
For now, all we really know is that
we haven't seen anybody yet.

153
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,759
But, we've only just started looking.

154
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,479
Until we finally find friendly super aliens
and can ask them to explain the rules of the universe to us,

155
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,639
most of us have to make do
with learning stuff ourselves.

156
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,239
Whether you're going back to school
leaving home for the first time,

157
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,519
or if you're just entering
a new phase in your life,

158
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,339
our shop is stocked and ready
for all your back-to-school needs.

159
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,939
Notebooks and notepads
to organize your work,

160
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,399
stickers and mugs
to make things look nice,

161
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,079
lots and lots of posters to turn your dorm or room
