1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,139
Getting to space is hard.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,619
Right now it's like going up a mountain

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,019
on a unicycle, with a backpack full of explosives:

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,899
Incredibly slow, you can't transport a lot of stuff,

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,679
and you might die.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,099
A rocket needs to reach a velocity of about 40,000 km/h

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,699
to escape from Earth.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,979
To get to that speed, rockets are mostly containers

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,979
for fuel with a tiny tip of payload.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,379
This is bad if you want to go to other planets

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,019
because you need a lot of heavy stuff if you want to survive

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,139
and maybe even come back.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,239
So is there a way to get to space with less fuel

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,999
and more payload?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,739
[Intro music]

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,319
A nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,459
is what you call infrastructure.

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,459
Whether it's roads for cars, ports for ships, or rails for trains,

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,499
we've made it easier to get to places.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,579
We can apply the same solution to space travel.

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,379
Space infrastructure will make getting into orbit

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,299
and out to the moon, Mars and beyond easier, and cheaper.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,999
Great, but what exactly is space infrastructure?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,759
Unlike an Earth-space elevator,

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,679
which is currently science fiction,

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,699
there is a simple yet promising technology

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,999
that does not require new science, magic materials,

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,559
or huge investments,

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,059
and that has been tested successfully in orbit already:

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,919
a cable and a weight,

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,639
know as a tether.

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,039
The concept is so simple, it's surprising.

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,559
What if we put tethers

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,679
hundreds or thousands of kilometers long into space,

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,799
and had spacecraft use them as ladders

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,779
to climb to higher altitudes and gain speed?

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,619
This concept is known as the Skyhook.

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,179
It works even bettter if we make it spin.

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,419
A counter-weight holds a long cable in place

40
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,299
while it rotates around a circle.

41
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,399
A rotating tether slows down its tip relative to the ground at the bottom

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,419
and speeds it up at the top like a catapult.

43
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,059
This means that you can transfer energy from the tether

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,639
and get a massive boost when released, more or less for free,

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,419
equal to twice the tether's rotation velocity.

46
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,659
Specialised fibers already exist that can survive

47
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,099
the extraordinary stresses a Skyhook would be faced with.

48
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,739
To protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites,

49
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,399
we can thread our tether into a web of redundant fibers.

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,099
Since our Skyhook would pass over the same spot many times a day,

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,639
this would allow small, reusable shuttles to catch up with it.

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,139
Of course, it's not that easy.

53
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,219
At its lowest point,

54
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,479
the tether's tip is dashing through the atmosphere

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,779
at around 12,000 kilometers per hour.

56
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,179
Because of Earth's atmosphere we can't lower the Skyhook too much,

57
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,719
or it will get too hot from air friction.

58
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,179
So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 km

59
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,459
and no lower.

60
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,919
To match this we'll need specialised spacecraft that can get to the tether.

61
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,979
While this isn't exactly easy,

62
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,664
it's still much cheaper than getting a big tin can

63
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:07,504
filled with rocket fuel to go 40,000 km/h.

64
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:09,999
Catching the tip will be a challenge too.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,299
There's only a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds

66
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,179
to find a tiny thing in the sky

67
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,159
moving at mach 12.

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,559
To make this easier, the tip could have a sort of fishing line

69
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,599
a kilometer long with a navigation drone that helps the spacecraft to connect.

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,499
Another challenge is keeping our Skyhook in orbit.

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,414
As more and more ships latch onto it and pull themselves up,

72
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:34,359
they use up the momentum that keeps it in place.

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,939
If we don't do anything

74
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,619
it will slow down and crash into the atmosphere.

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,819
And here, we can cheat the universe a bit.

76
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,879
The Skyhook is a battery of orbital energy.

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,239
It's possible to balance the payloads coming in and being sent off.

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,799
Arriving ships bringing humans and materials home to Earth

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,219
add energy to the tether

80
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,359
which it can give to other ships departing into space.

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,979
This way the tether doesn't lose any energy.

82
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,179
The more we use it, the cheaper it gets.

83
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,579
If we're still losing energy with each boost,

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,419
we can recover it with small electric or chemical engines

85
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,919
that regularly correct the tether's position.

86
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,999
A set of tethers, one around Earth and one around Mars,

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,759
could make trips between the planets fast, straightforward,

88
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,639
and low-cost compared to rockets.

89
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,219
The Earth tether would sit in low Earth orbit to grab people and payloads

90
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,859
and fling them off to Mars.

91
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,599
The Mars tether catches them

92
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,679
and slows them down for a landing on the surface.

93
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,079
In the opposite direction,

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,379
the tether could pick up a vehicle travelling through Mars's thin atmosphere

95
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,959
at only about 1,000 km/h,

96
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,319
not much faster than our airliners on Earth,

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,179
and fling it back to Earth to be caught and lowered down.

98
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,679
The tethers could shorten trips between both planets from 9 months

99
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,539
down to 5 or even 3,

100
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,639
and reduce the scale of the rockets required

101
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,279
by between 84 and 96 percent.

102
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,939
Even better, people may be able to travel in relative luxury,

103
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,979
as we can afford to invest in passenger comfort.

104
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,559
Tether travel would be first class seats to Mars.

105
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,699
Together, tethers around Earth and Mars

106
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,899
could provide the rapid and cost-efficient transportation backbone

107
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,679
that would make space travel affordable.

108
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,239
But let's go further.

109
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,159
Starting from low Mars orbit,

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,999
a tether could boost ships to the asteroid belt.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,359
The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down

112
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,919
at its destination.

113
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,859
Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them

114
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,939
and send them back for free.

115
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,859
Getting to asteroids cheaply

116
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,779
is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system.

117
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,859
Precious metals and valuable minerals

118
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,099
could be delivered to Mars just weeks after they were cut out of their asteroid.

119
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,939
They would be the perfect building blocks

120
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,819
for our interplanetary civilisation.

121
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,379
But why stop here?

122
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,779
Mars moons are very convenient.

123
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,839
No other moons in the solar system orbit that close to their planet.

124
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,699
Phobos is so heavy that we don't need to worry about slowing it down,

125
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,759
making it the perfect attachment point

126
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,499
for super tethers just under 6,000 km long.

127
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,359
The lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars

128
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,219
and be very easy to catch.

129
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,379
The upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn.

130
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,799
The same super-tether

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,099
can also bring the inner solar system closer.

132
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,219
Venus and Mercury are a single swing away.

133
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,339
Unlike Mars, they're bursting with solar energy

134
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,699
and are rich in minerals.

135
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,519
In the long term, nothing is stopping humanity from

136
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,479
constructing a zero-propellent transport network

137
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,879
for the terrestrial planets centred on the martian moons.

138
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,859
Tethers are a comparably cheap

139
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,699
and sustainable solution to making space travel affordable

140
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,119
and the rest of the solar system accessible

141
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,839
for exploitation and exploration.

142
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,979
Considering that we have the technology to build them today,

143
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,539
there's really no good excuse to wait any longer.

144
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,279
Parts of the solar system are far away,

145
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,059
but they could be very close.

146
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,559

147
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,279
