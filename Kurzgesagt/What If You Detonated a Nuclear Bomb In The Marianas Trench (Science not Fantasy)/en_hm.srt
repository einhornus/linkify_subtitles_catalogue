1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,039
What would happen if we detonated humanity's most powerful nuclear weapon at the deepest point of the ocean?

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,359
For sure, tsunamis hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities,

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,139
earthquakes would level countries,

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,019
new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,519
Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart?

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,559
Or thrown out of orbit?

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,839
Well, almost.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,219
Currently, Earth's deepest known point is inside the Mariana Trench.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,919
The Mariana Trench is a very deep valley

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,099
right at the edge of two tectonic plates

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,559
that looks like an upside-down mountain.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,119
It reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers,

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,439
almost three times deeper than
the dark grave of the Titanic.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,139
It's one of the last places on Earth for humans to explore.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,599
Pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure,

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,859
it's a relatively pristine environment thanks to the absence of humans.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,959
A great place for our nuclear test.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,739
We'll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded,

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:08,339
the RDS-220 hydrogen bomb or Tsar Bomba.

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,479
Its explosion was so massive that its shockwave traveled around the Earth three times,

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,579
and its mushroom cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky.

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,199
Its shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything in a thousand square kilometers,

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,719
its fireball hot enough to burn the rubble.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,139
Bombs like this release such an enormous amount of energy at once, that they could boil away an entire lake.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,219
And if we set off a nuclear bomb in the Mariana Trench, that's exactly what happens.

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,099
Let's pull the trigger.

27
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,659
In the first few microseconds, the nuclear fuel undergoes its chain reaction

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,079
and explodes with the power of 50 megatons of TNT.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,579
A blinding flash of light illuminates the darkness of the trench for the first time in history.

30
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,699
The heat of the explosion produces a cavity, a flaming bubble of water vapor,

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,319
radioactive nuclei, and the remains of very unlucky fish.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,059
The bubble grows quickly as it vaporizes the water around it.

33
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,039
The pressure of the bubble is immense, plowing outwards as if there's nothing in the way.

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,519
Sending off a shockwave that will be felt by seismic stations and whales around the world.

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,719
And then, almost as fast as it emerges, it stops.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,619
On the surface of the Earth, this fireball bubble would grow to ten kilometers the second after it's detonated,

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,359
as the atmosphere barely puts up a fight to hold it back.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,419
But the pressure at the bottom of
the Mariana Trench is enormous.

39
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,719
With 11 kilometres of water overhead,

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,479
being in the Mariana Trench is like being crushed by a hydraulic press from every direction.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,239
Here, a second after the detonation, our bubble is about a kilometer across, when oddly enough, it starts to shrink.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,299
The bubble overextends itself, losing pressure as it expands, until the water turns it back, recompressing it.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,819
The tug of war between the fiery death bubble and water goes back and forth a few times,

44
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,759
the bubble shrinking and growing, until eventually the bubble loses for good.

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,799
The pressure around it is too great, and turbulent water begins to chop it up.

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,179
It becomes something like the underwater equivalent of a mushroom cloud

47
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,499
as it disintegrates into many smaller, hot and radioactive bubbles drifting upwards.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,419
And as our mighty destructive blast rises to the surface, it does basically nothing.

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,899
Just a small wave, and a bubbling plume of radioactive warm water in the Pacific.

50
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,079
No tsunami will wash away Japan or California,

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,759
although boats and whales in the area might have a bad time.

52
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,639
The radioactive fallout will be diluted into the Pacific after a few days,

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,479
although a fair amount of radioactive water and salt makes it to the atmosphere

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,919
where it collects and then rains down again.

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,159
Even if the wind blows the fallout directly towards the Philippines,

56
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,359
the worst of it probably happens over the oceans.

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,819
But clearly, the real danger comes from our explosion-triggering earthquakes and volcanoes, right?

58
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:19,099
Even if we detonated the bomb right in the trench at the exact point where tectonic plates touch, probably not.

59
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,079
The explosion would vaporize a part of the seafloor, and turn a lot of sand into glass,

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,359
but most of the energy goes into the water, not seismic waves.

61
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,119
Earthquakes are already quite common at tectonic plate boundaries.

62
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,279
And earthquakes with as much seismic energy as our bomb

63
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,759
happen a few times a year without triggering any sort of apocalypse.

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,779
But maybe it will affect the Earth's orbit.

65
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,479
Since no mass is taken away or added to the Earth, our orbit is completely unaffected.

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,099
Also, there have been well over a thousand nuclear tests in the last 70 years

67
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,599
and that didn't change our orbit, so why would this time be different?

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,359
The strongest forces humanity can unleash are laughable compared to the forces of nature.

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,579
The planet is too big. It doesn't care.

70
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,839
So, what happens to us if we detonate a nuclear weapon really deep in the ocean?

71
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,119
Pretty much nothing.

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,379
Did you know that every bird in our videos has an owner?

73
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,119
More than 1,000 people have got their own bird.

74
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,859
It helps us explain things, clowns around in the background,

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,179
or dies a horrible and avoidable death.

76
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,139
If you want your own bird too and you 
want it to appear in one of our videos,

77
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,179
you can get it at patreon.com/kurzgesagt.

78
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,639
Patreon is one of the main ways we sustain ourselves.

79
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:52,019
So on top of getting a super nice avatar, you also help us make more and better videos.
