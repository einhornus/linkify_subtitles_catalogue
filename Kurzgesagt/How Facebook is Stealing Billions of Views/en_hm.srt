00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,499
A few days ago Facebook proudly announced that

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,439
they'd achieved eight billion video views a day.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,059
That's really impressive,

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,759
until you learn

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,859
that in the first quarter of 2015,

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,179
seven hundred and twenty-five

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,419
of the 1000 most-viewed videos on Facebook

8
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,359
were stolen,

9
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,939
amassing a total of 17 billion views.

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,939
Sites and content aggregators

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,479
steal videos from YouTube

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,299
to go viral on Facebook.

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,539
These videos go viral

14
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,199
because Facebook is cheating.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,319
They rig their algorithms so that videos uploaded into their player

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,258
are preferred to YouTube links,

17
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:32,758
because users

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,759
should be kept as long as possible on the site

19
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,099
so Facebook can show them

20
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,739
as many ads as possible.

21
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,559
This is after all their business model.

22
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,699
But it also cheats when it comes to views.

23
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,699
A view is counted after three seconds

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,699
even if the video is muted.

25
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,699
Which means that because of autoplay,

26
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,699
if you scroll through your timeline slowly enough,

27
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,679
you count as a viewer.

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,159
That means engagement is terrible,

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,379
compared to Youtube views,

30
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,879
Facebook views plummet after a few seconds,

31
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,139
because most views are not real.

32
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,098
But large numbers are impressive,

33
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,599
so Facebook keeps pretending.

34
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,799
While this forced virality is weird,

35
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,079
the real problem is the so called "Freebooting",

36
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,999
the stealing of videos.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,059
Since Facebook prefers its own player,

38
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,479
stolen videos reach way more people than the original.

39
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,879
Lately, this has happened to us more and more often.

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,039
The most recent example

41
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,759
amassed 3.2 million views

42
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,819
and 140,000 shares

43
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,619
in 2 days, while our old post

44
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,399
just reached 100,000 people and got shared 1000 times.

45
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,699
Other creators are hit even harder,

46
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,579
SmarterEveryDay's videos get stolen constantly,

47
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,419
getting viewed up to 17 million times.

48
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,439
But even this is dwarfed by examples like

49
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,259
Tyrese Gibson,

50
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,259
a singer who steals viral videos

51
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,259
like this one with 86 million

52
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,939
views on his Facebook page.

53
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,259
He adds a link to buy his music, too.

54
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,259
He's not alone in this, a whole group of people

55
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,259
have built their online presence around stealing

56
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,539
other people's work.

57
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,259
This is really bad for

58
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,739
independent creators.

59
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,319
Contrary to popular belief,

60
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,799
stolen content gives creators close

61
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,799
to no exposure at all.

62
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,799
Only the thief and Facebook profit

63
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,099
from this.

64
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,099
Quality content takes a lot of

65
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,459
creativity, time and love.

66
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,099
In our case, a single video

67
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,799
literally takes hundreds of hours to make.

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,559
Even we, with more than a million subscribers

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,479
are dependent on the ads and exposure.

70
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,299
Without ads, and the support of our generous patrons, we could not make videos.

71
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,819
For a small creator, a viral video can be the difference between a career and a hobby.

72
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:37,239
On YouTube, this kind of theft is not a problem, because they have major safeguards that protect content from being stolen.

73
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,979
Although, the Content ID system is far from perfect, especially for film critics and gamers.

74
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:49,039
Facebook, on the other hand, pretends everything is fine and constantly announces one milestone after the other.

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,719
But things are not fine.

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,699
Let's look at the process of claiming your copyright on Facebook in the last year.

77
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,699
One: get an e-mail or tweet from a fan, that gives you a direct link to your video.

78
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,739
It's not possible to search for your videos on Facebook yourself; you depend on luck to find your stolen videos.

79
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,859
Two: search for 'Facebook copyright infringement' on Google, because it's actually faster this way.

80
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,419
Three: fill out an annoyingly long contact form.

81
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,939
Four: watch the views on your stolen videos rise.

82
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,499
Five: Facebook finally pulls the video.

83
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,779
Conveniently, the video has already gained 99% of all the views it will ever get.

84
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,139
The thief doesn't have to fear any negative consequences at all.

85
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,299
This is what succesful creators have to deal with constantly,

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,179
and on top of losing out in terms of exposure and money, it just feels like a violation to be treated like that.

87
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,079
In a recent statement, Facebook announced they want to change.

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,299
But it's hard to take them seriously when it still takes days for a stolen viral video to be taken down,

89
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,339
and Facebook does not share the profits made from it.

90
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,299
At this point, Facebook is not a partner creators look forward to working with.

91
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,839
They've built their video empire on stolen content, and disregard for original content creators.

92
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,319
This is absolutely unacceptable for a corporation worth billions of dollars.

93
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,019
Facebook is already testing various monetization models that will give the uploaders a cut of the ad revenue.

94
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,399
Which, with the current state of play, is troubling.

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,799
Right now, this is mainly being tested with big media companies,

96
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,439
but, as creators, we don't feel like we're being asked or taken into consideration by the giant business Facebook.

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,939
What can you, as a viewer, to do help here?

98
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,099
If you spot stolen content on Facebook,

99
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,479
make a comment linking to the original content.

100
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,099
Alert the original creator,

101
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,859
because only they can file a copyright report.

102
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,499
Share this video, or the one done by SmarterEveryDay.

103
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,079
We all want the same thing: a free internet that's the basis for creativity, community and great stuff.

104
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,959
We sincerely hope that Facebook will soon become a partner instead an obstacle to this goal.
