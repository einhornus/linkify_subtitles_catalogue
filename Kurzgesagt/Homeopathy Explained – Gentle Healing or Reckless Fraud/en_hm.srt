1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,859
Homeopathy may be the most controversial, but also the most popular alternative medicine.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:12,239
While some argue against it, others swear by its great power and effectiveness.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,739
How does homeopathy work?

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:29,699
How did it become what it is today, and what can modern medicine learn from it?

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,319
The first principle of homeopathy is "like cures like."

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,359
Remedies use ingredients that cause the symptoms you want to cure.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,939
In practice  that means that remedies against fever could for example be made from belladonna, which also causes fever.

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,459
A mixture based from bee venom is used to treat itchy swellings, and so on.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,179
The second principle is the special method of preparation called potentization.

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:02,059
The idea is that diluting, and agitating the ingredients activates their curative powers, and enhances their effect.

11
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,579
To do this the ingredient is dissolved in alcohol, or distilled water.

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,739
Homeopaths take one part of the solution and mix it with nine parts of water,

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,459
diluting it down to one tenth of its original concentration, and shaking it.

14
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,639
What you have now is a 1X potency,

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,139
one-part ingredient and nine parts solvent,

16
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,279
named after the Roman numeral X, for 10.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,579
Now, this process is repeated.

18
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,779
Take one part, mix it with nine parts of pure water and shake it vigorously. Now you have 2X.

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,259
You do this again and again until you reach the desired grade of potency.

20
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,739
The finished remedy is then taken orally, or sometimes

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,479
it's applied as little sugar pellets that are sold as globuli.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,499
A 20X potency, for example, is like dissolving one aspirin pill in the water volume of the whole Atlantic.

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,139
But many are much more extreme, like 30C, for example.

24
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,699
C means that the mixture has one part ingredient and 99 parts water.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,179
So the commonly sold 30C mixture means one part ingredient, and

26
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,038
one million billion billion billion billion billion billion parts of water.

27
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,759
If we wanted a globuli pill with a single atom of the original ingredient,

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,419
then our pill would be the diameter of the distance between the Earth and the Sun.

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,679
150,000,000 kilometers,

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,399
a pill so massive, that it would collapse into a black hole under its own mass.

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,819
Because of this, potentization is one of the biggest criticisms of homeopathy.

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,079
The extreme dilution is supposed to make the ingredients more potent,

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,019
but on a physical level, this doesn't really make sense.

34
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,059
Most homeopathic remedies are diluted so much

35
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,679
that not a single atom of the active ingredient is left in them.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,439
The explanation of why the mixtures still work is that shaking the mixture after every dilution leaves behind a

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,019
spirit like essence of the ingredient.

38
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,559
Basically, the idea is that water remembers what was put into it.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,279
But if this were true, then every substance that ever met a drop of water would leave an essence behind

40
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,519
and lead to unpredictable effects when it was accidentally ingested.

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,799
Think of all the stuff that lives and floats in the oceans.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,539
Every sip of water would be a supercharged homeopathic cocktail.

43
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,099
So, how did homeopathy become the most successful alternative medicine?

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,279
In the 18th century, medicine was very different from today.

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,559
Treatments like blood letting left the patient worse off than before.

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:33,059
So German physician Samuel Hahnemann wanted a non invasive, natural way of healing and developed homeopathy.

47
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,719
And in fact, homeopathic hospitals were soon successful because doing no harm beats doing harm.

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,579
Hahnemann imposed very strict rules on his patients.

49
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:51,179
First you had to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, spicy food, sweet food. No old cheese, no onions, no meat.

50
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,699
No clothes made from sheep's wool, but also no sedentary work, no sitting inside in stuffy air, no warm rooms, no riding horses,

51
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,859
no napping, no playing games,

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,739
no masturbation, and of course, no reading p***agraphic texts, and many more.

53
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,599
Then and only then would his remedies work, according to the inventor of homeopathy.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,379
Of course all of these instructions are ignored and not talked about today.

55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,018
Medicine has changed a lot in the last 150 years.

56
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,359
Never before in human history have we enjoyed a comparable level of health.

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,779
Never have we lived as long, and this is largely due to the new tools we've developed.

58
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,479
Modern diagnostics, double blinded studies, and scientific evaluation to check and prove which stuff works.

59
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,339
Thanks to these tools after countless studies and reviews,

60
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,539
we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that homeopathy does not have any effect beyond placebo.

61
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,879
But, even so who cares why it works if it helps people?

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,919
Maybe you tried it and felt better,

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,539
or you know someone that got over a horrible disease while using homeopathic remedies,

64
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,099
and there are plenty of reports of it working for children and animals.

65
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,399
What do we make of these experiences?

66
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,299
The Placebo Effect is very real and not imaginary.

67
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,299
No matter how smart you are you're not immune to it.

68
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,039
If people believe that something will help them feel better, their trust alone has the desired effect.

69
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,099
And, it's been proven that the Placebo Effect can be transferred.

70
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,779
Children and animals rely on their parents, or keepers and are in tune to their emotions.

71
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,399
If a parent has a lot of trust in a treatment and eases up, this can help a child relax and help relieve symptoms.

72
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,739
This could also be observed with animals who react strongly to the body language cues of the people caring for them.

73
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,519
But the most powerful tool of homeopathy is time,

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,979
our bodies are survival machines.

75
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,639
Infections pass on their own after a few days.

76
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,719
But if you take some remedy when you already feel sick  and then start getting better,

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,359
it feels like it did indeed cure you when actually, it would have happened anyway.

78
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,759
The homeopathy industry likes to play the gentle alternative to Big Pharma.

79
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,939
But, the homeopathic industry is Big Pharma.

80
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,339
Billions of dollars are made with extreme profit margins.

81
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,899
The homeopathy industry has its own lobby organizations, and fights its enemies as hard as it can.

82
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,999
A lot of money is on the line.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,939
Globally, the market is expected to reach over 17 billion by 2024.

84
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:27,719
Some critics even argue that the homeopathic industry is bad for public health because it creates distrust in proven medicine.

85
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,079
The belief in homeopathy correlates with skepticism about vaccinations.

86
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,859
This can discourage people to seek the help they need

87
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,539
when their lives or the lives of their children are on the line.

88
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:45,219
But there is actually a key to the success of homeopathy that we could and should, copy.

89
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,419
The first consultation with a homeopath can take hours and is very personal.

90
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,679
For a patient who's already been on a pilgrimage from doctor to doctor,

91
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,099
this level of attention and empathy can make a huge difference to their well being,

92
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,659
even if the conversation was not the point of the therapy.

93
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,739
Modern medicine is efficient. It saves millions of lives each year.

94
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,379
But, it's also a strictly organized system.

95
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,999
Tight budgets force doctors and nurses to deal with lots of patients.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
Consultations need to be time efficient,

97
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,059
diagnoses made quickly treatments fast,

98
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,799
which can leave patients feeling invisible scared, and left behind.

99
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,879
This is what modern medicine can learn from homeopathy.

100
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,379
It meets a human need that has been left unfulfilled.

101
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,479
We need to make time for the individual again. See people, not numbers.

102
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,079
But as important as empathy is, it's not a substitute for actual treatment.

103
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:50,679
Faith can move mountains, but sugar water can't cure cancer.

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,879
After a short break of a few years, Kurzgesagt is back in German.

105
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,759
Thanks to the support of Funk, we have relaunched the German channel and are beginning to upload a video every 1-2 weeks.

106
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,899
Besides redoing our favorite videos,

107
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,939
there'll be a number of videos that will not exist in English for a while.

108
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,219
Check out the channel here, tell us what you think, and subscribe and watch a few.

109
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,740
If the channel goes well, the German videos might become a regular thing for years, and we might even do more languages.
