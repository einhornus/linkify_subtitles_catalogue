00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,003
today we are answering an age-old very

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,758
scientific and important question

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,558
what if the moon crashes into earth

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,359
it's more interesting and weird than you

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,959
probably think

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,015
let's start with the basics

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,719
why isn't the moon on its way to crash

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,680
into us already

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,610
[Music]

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,027
we know that earth's gravity pulls

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,358
everything towards it including the moon

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,032
but somehow it stays up as if suspended

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,319
by some opposite force

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,398
but there is no other force countering

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,119
gravity instead the trick to staying up

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,679
is a sideways motion that we call an

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,878
orbit

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,878
you see orbits every day when you throw

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,439
a ball it makes a tiny little orbit

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,959
the only difference between the balls

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,198
orbit and the moons is that the ball

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,359
eventually hits the ground

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,878
basically the reason is speed

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,878
if you could throw your ball fast enough

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,639
it would bend around the world and come

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,679
back to you

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,839
if there were no air slowing it down it

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,518
could orbit forever

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,599
and this is what the moon does

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,239
falling sideways around earth very fast

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,559
with no air slowing it down orbiting

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,478
earth every 27 days at 3 600 kilometers

33
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,599
an hour

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,599
so for the moon to just stop in its

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,359
orbit and plummet to the earth would

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,118
break more laws of physics than we have

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,639
time to explain

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,519
so how do we crash it into earth

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,679
in a nutshell to change an object's

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,319
orbit you need to change its speed which

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,798
changes where gravity takes it

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,199
but even small changes require enormous

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,959
forces which is why all the large

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,879
objects in the solar system are so

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,959
stable nowadays

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,279
according to science the moon is big and

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,478
very massive

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,719
even igniting billions of rocket engines

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,798
all over its surface would barely move

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,919
the moon

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,919
it looks like nothing short of magic

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,239
will make the moon fall so we'll use a

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,639
magic spell that slows down the moon so

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,798
much that it changes its orbit and

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,879
spirals towards earth

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,959
to get the most from the experience the

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,279
moon will take exactly one year before

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,009
it hits earth

59
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,159
ready

60
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,279
three

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,399
two

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,999
one

63
00:02:14,0014 --> 00:02:15,999
magic

64
00:02:16,0016 --> 00:02:16,839
month one

65
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,399
[Music]

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,318
for the first few days nothing really

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,159
changes the moon gets a tiny bit

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,639
brighter and scientists get confused but

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,159
the rest of us don't notice anything

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,439
different

71
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,279
the only noticeable real effect of the

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,439
moon on the earth are the tides

73
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,518
tides exist because while earth pulls on

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,518
the moon the moon's gravity pulls back

75
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,799
on the earth

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,399
since the strength of gravity gets

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,479
weaker with distance different parts of

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,878
the earth feel a slightly different pull

79
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,479
which causes the earth especially the

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,479
oceans to bulge when the moon is above

81
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,479
them and contract a little on the sides

82
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,518
when it's not as earth rotates every day

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,359
underneath the moon the moon's influence

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,279
fluctuates causing the water level of

85
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,119
the oceans to rise and fall by about

86
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,359
half a meter twice a day

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,359
but with the moon drawing ever closer

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,559
high tide gets higher every day

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,559
at first barely noticeable within a

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,158
month the moon has covered half the

91
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,238
distance to the earth and ocean tides

92
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,238
have grown to four meters

93
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,559
every day high tide comes and waves

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,518
flood coastal cities and there's no end

95
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,559
in sight

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,878
with the moon drawing ever closer tides

97
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,598
rise ever higher inundating another city

98
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,318
and more inhabited land with salty water

99
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,919
every day

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,479
month two

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,399
by the end of month two the moon has

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,158
covered two thirds of the distance to

103
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,036
earth and global infrastructure is

104
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:39,199
crumbling as tides rise above 10 meters

105
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,279
displacing up to a billion people who

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,598
happen to live near the coastlines

107
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,759
as ports become inoperable shipping

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,439
grinds to a halt

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,359
not only will it slow down the delivery

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,518
of quartzquez products but also less

111
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,598
exciting things like food

112
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,238
global communications fall into disarray

113
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,798
95 of the internet is carried by ocean

114
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,958
crossing cables and while these largely

115
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,199
don't mind the water their terminals on

116
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,958
land do

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,199
living inland doesn't guarantee safety

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,759
either tidal balls cause rivers to flow

119
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,759
backwards carrying salt water to

120
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,839
contaminate surface and ground water

121
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,119
supplies

122
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,439
gas shortages follow as all refineries

123
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,679
near the coast are abandoned

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,357
countries are left with the supplies

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,679
they had on their shelves and strict

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,359
rationing will begin

127
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,599
in the cities chaos reigns during the

128
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,599
scavenging hours of low tide while

129
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,918
survivors take refuge in high rises when

130
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,239
the water returns

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,918
month three

132
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,519
three months in and the moon is close

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,519
enough to disrupt communication and

134
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,439
navigation satellites

135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,279
while it's normally far too distant for

136
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,045
its gravity to cause any major problems

137
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:47,279
for our satellites the closer it gets

138
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,758
the more warped their orbits become

139
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,999
as their fuel for orbital corrections

140
00:04:52,0052 --> 00:04:54,478
runs out satellites careen out of

141
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,056
control

142
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:59,280
months four and five

143
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,918
on earth the tides are rapidly growing

144
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,399
to about 30 meters and will be reaching

145
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,638
100 meters in height in a few short

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,839
weeks

147
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,010
at low tide the ocean recedes hundreds

148
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,239
of kilometers exposing the continental

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,559
shelf like vast deserts while at high

150
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,279
tide walls of water drown agriculture

151
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,679
houses and skyscrapers

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,159
and now almost five months in the

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,279
apocalypse has finished its warm-up act

154
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,198
since the oceans are on average only

155
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,119
three kilometers deep the tides have

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,719
reached their maximum

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,959
up until now the water in the oceans

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,959
could flow absorbing most of the moon's

159
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,879
gravitational squeezing but now the

160
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,879
earth itself is really feeling the

161
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,519
squeeze of the ever approaching moon

162
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,044
these aren't so much tides of water but

163
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,839
tides of rock

164
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,599
the squeezing of the planet combined

165
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,359
with the weight of quintillions of tons

166
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,198
of water sloshing on and off the

167
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,198
tectonic plates creates enormous

168
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,439
stresses below and begins to cause

169
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,839
earthquakes of increasing magnitude and

170
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,318
intensity it's impossible to say how

171
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,239
serious these earthquakes might be or

172
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,004
where they occur but like a child

173
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:06,239
jumping on their bed until it breaks no

174
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,159
good can come of it

175
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,559
strong tidal forces lead to volcanism on

176
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,719
other planets and moons on earth

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,799
squeezing the planet disrupts the magma

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,279
reservoirs inside the crust triggering

179
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,599
sizeable climate altering eruptions in

chile new zealand yellowstone and

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,839
elsewhere

182
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,719
meanwhile watching patiently above is

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,918
the moon

184
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,918
still no bigger in the sky than a small

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,198
cloud

186
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,034
within 75 000 kilometers of earth it is

187
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:35,758
bright enough to illuminate the night

188
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,679
sky like twilight

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,159
months six and seven

190
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,239
after half a year the moon is entering

191
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,839
the space once occupied by

192
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,519
geosynchronous satellites where it

193
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,559
orbits earth every 24 hours it appears

194
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,119
to float at one spot in the sky unmoving

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,959
cycling through a full set of phases

196
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,359
every day but only visible to half the

197
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,559
planet

198
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,959
with the moon stationary above the earth

199
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,598
the tides seem to freeze in place

200
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,598
half the world flooded half with its

201
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,918
water seemingly returned to the sea as

202
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,519
if earth is holding its breath to

203
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,439
prepare for the worst

204
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,519
as the moon sinks further you might

205
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,439
wonder if its gravity would overpower

206
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,439
earth's pulling you up and ending your

207
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,638
misery

208
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,239
fortunately not

209
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,478
the earth's surface gravity is about six

210
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,638
times stronger than the moons so even if

211
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,318
the moon were hovering right on top of

212
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,279
you you would still stay on the ground

213
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,519
on the moon things are different though

214
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,119
the near side of the moon is more

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,359
strongly affected by earth's gravity so

216
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,359
during the next few months it starts to

217
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,279
stretch forward towards the earth into

218
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,359
something of an egg triggering deep

219
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,598
moonquakes as the lunar rock flexes and

220
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,043
changes shape

221
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,918
though barely noticeable now this squish

222
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,758
will grow to hundreds of kilometers in a

223
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,918
matter of months

224
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,318
months eight to eleven

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,055
at this point the apocalypse has arrived

226
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:56,719
and we can summarize the months before

227
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,519
the crash as everybody left has a really

228
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,119
bad time

229
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,119
the tides sweeping over the earth slow

230
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,519
down and then reverse their direction

231
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,918
because the moon now orbits earth faster

232
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,159
than it rotates

233
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,159
the planet will experience an abundance

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,799
of earthquakes and volcanism massive

235
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,017
amounts of volcanic aerosols rise high

236
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:18,878
into the stratosphere shiny enough to

237
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,279
reflect sunlight back into space

238
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,198
what little light gets through is rust

239
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,198
red and is periodically diminished by

240
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,999
daily eclipses the result is a rapid

241
00:08:28,0028 --> 00:08:29,918
global cooling with acid rains and

242
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,918
summer snows killing even the hardiest

243
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,957
plants

244
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,918
the clock runs out on civilization

245
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,158
billions have perished while an x-shaped

246
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,639
moon is still drawing closer

247
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,678
let's get ready for the grand finale

248
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,679
month 12.

249
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,999
finally at the end of the year the moon

250
00:08:48,0048 --> 00:08:50,239
has reached the rash limit

251
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,679
that's the point where earth's

252
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,679
gravitational pull on the moon is

253
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,319
stronger than the moon's own gravity

254
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,999
things on the lunar surface start

255
00:08:58,0058 --> 00:08:59,919
falling towards earth and by the time it

256
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,319
crosses 10 000 kilometers the entire

257
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,958
moon disintegrates into rubble smearing

258
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,359
itself into a massive ring system around

259
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,639
the earth

260
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,719
fortunately the moon's disintegration

261
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,359
means the misery on earth has ended

262
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,679
no moon means the general apocalyptic

263
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,239
nature of things comes to a halt

264
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,958
the oceans recede flowing off the land

265
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,719
one last time

266
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,439
any survivors are treated to a view of

267
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,239
tremendous arches spanning the sky

268
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,479
glimmering in the sunlight illuminating

269
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,639
the night sky more brilliantly than any

270
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,719
full moon ever could while meteor

271
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,518
showers of moon dust fill the sky

272
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,759
it's hard to say what happens next but

273
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,999
the tranquility may be short-lived

274
00:09:42,0042 --> 00:09:44,239
if too much moon dust rains down

275
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,479
friction heats the atmosphere possibly

276
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,319
boiling the oceans

277
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,879
if not the enormous shadows cast by the

278
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,278
rings combined with all the volcanic and

279
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,759
meteoric aerosols block even more

280
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,319
sunlight and a period of runaway cooling

281
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,719
could begin that freezes much of earth's

282
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,440
surface solid

283
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,119
in any case at some point people will

284
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,999
emerge again from submarines or bunkers

285
00:10:10,0010 --> 00:10:12,239
or mountaintops

286
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,319
they will not have a great time before

287
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,239
rebuilding civilization and their

288
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,639
success is not guaranteed

289
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,319
but at least they'll be trying to do so

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,249
with beautiful rings in the sky

291
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,690
[Music]

292
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,159
so how do you calculate that sort of

293
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,159
thing well you just need a bit of

294
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,999
insanity and some maths

295
00:10:34,0034 --> 00:10:35,679
if you need to brush up on the latter

296
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,278

problems in maths science and computer

306
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,799
science in a way that feels more like

307
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,879
playing a game than doing homework

308
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,479
lessons will surprise you with

309
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,799
storytelling code writing tasks and

entertained all the content is

313
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,679
interactive instead of just reading and

314
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,679
listening to explanations you drag and

315
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,016
drop manipulate shapes and diagrams make

316
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:18,799
selections and answer questions this way

317
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,559
you learn something almost without you

318
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,999
noticing it and tiny step by step you'll

319
00:11:24,0024 --> 00:11:25,999
build up your long-term understanding of

320
00:11:26,0026 --> 00:11:28,239
science and get closer to your stem
