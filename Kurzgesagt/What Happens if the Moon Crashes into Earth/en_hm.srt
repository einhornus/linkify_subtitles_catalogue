00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,200
Today we are answering an age-old very 
scientific and important question:  

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,012
What if the moon crashes into earth? It’s more 
interesting and weird than you probably think.  

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,680
Let's start with the basics: Why isn't the 
Moon on its way to crash into us already?

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,240
We know that earth’s gravity pulls everything 
towards it, including the Moon, but somehow,  

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,400
it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite 
force. But there is no other force countering  

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,042
gravity - instead, the trick to staying up 
is a ‘sideways’ motion that we call an orbit.

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,800
You see orbits every day: when you throw 
a ball it makes a tiny little orbit.  

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,200
The only difference between that ball’s 
orbit and the moon’s is that the ball  

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,920
eventually hits the ground. 
Basically, the reason is speed.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,120
If you could throw your ball fast enough, it 
would bend around the world and come back to you.  

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,960
If there was no air slowing it down, it could 
orbit forever. And this is what the moon does:

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,480
Falling sideways around earth, very fast, with no 
air slowing it down. Orbiting earth every 27 days,  

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,360
at 3600 km/h. So for the moon to just stop 
in its orbit and plummet to the earth would  

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
break more laws of physics than we have time 
to explain. So how do we crash it into earth?

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,920
In a nutshell, to change an object’s 
orbit, you need to change its speed,  

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
which changes where gravity takes it. But 
even small changes require enormous forces,  

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,920
which is why all the large objects in 
the solar system are so stable nowadays.

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,720
According to science, the moon is big and very 
massive. Even igniting billions of rocket engines  

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,320
all over its surface would barely move the Moon.
It looks like nothing short of magic will make  

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,059
the moon fall. So we’ll use a magic 
spell that slows down the moon so much  

21
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:04,800
that it changes its orbit and spirals towards 
earth. To get the most from the experience,  

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:14,480
the moon will take exactly one year before 
it hits earth. Ready? 3. 2. 1. *Magic

23
00:02:16,0016 --> 00:02:16,640
Month 1

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,640
For the first few days, nothing really 
changes. The moon gets a tiny bit brighter  

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,480
and scientists get confused, but the rest 
of us don’t notice anything different.

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,880
The only noticeable real effect of 
the moon on the earth are the tides.  

27
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,160
Tides exist because while earth pulls on the 
moon, the moon’s gravity pulls back on the earth.  

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Since the strength of gravity gets weaker 
with distance, different parts of the earth  

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,045
feel a slightly different pull. Which 
causes the earth, especially the oceans,  

30
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:48,800
to bulge when the moon is above them, and 
contract a little on the sides when it’s  

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,160
not. As earth rotates every day underneath 
the moon, the moon’s influence fluctuates,  

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
causing the water-level of the oceans to rise 
and fall by about half a meter twice a day.

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,160
But with the moon drawing ever closer, high tide 
gets higher every day. At first barely noticeable,  

34
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,400
within a month the moon has covered half the 
distance to the earth and ocean tides have  

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,160
grown to 4 meters. Everyday high tide 
comes and waves flood coastal cities.  

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,022
And there is no end in sight. With the moon 
drawing ever closer, tides rise ever higher,  

37
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:26,880
inundating another city and more 
inhabited land with salty water every day.

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,640
Month 2

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
By the end of month 2 the moon has covered 
two-thirds of the distance to earth,  

40
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,920
and global infrastructure is crumbling as 
tides rise above ten meters – displacing up  

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,800
to a billion people who happen 
to live near the coastlines.

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,960
As ports become inoperable shipping grinds 
to a halt. Not only will it slow down the  

43
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,880
delivery of Kurzgesagt products but 
also less exciting things like food.  

44
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,840
Global communications fall into disarray – 95% of 
the internet is carried by ocean-crossing cables,  

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,920
and while these largely don’t mind the water, 
their terminals on land do. Living inland  

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,400
doesn’t guarantee safety either, tidal 
bores cause rivers to flow backwards,  

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,320
carrying saltwater to contaminate 
surface and groundwater supplies.

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,640
Gas shortages follow, as oil refineries near 
the coast are abandoned. Countries are left  

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,240
with the supplies they had on their shelves 
and strict rationing will begin. In the cities,  

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,360
chaos reigns during the 
scavenging hours of low tide,  

51
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,960
while survivors take refuge in 
highrises when the water returns.

52
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,880
Month 3

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,360
Three months in and the moon is 
close enough to disrupt communication  

54
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,400
and navigation satellites. While it is normally 
far too distant for its gravity to cause any  

55
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,120
major problems for our satellites, the closer 
it gets the more warped their orbits become.  

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,056
As their fuel for orbital corrections runs 
out, satellites careen out of control.

57
00:04:56,056 --> 00:05:01,120
Month 4 - 5
On earth, the tides are  

58
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,960
rapidly growing to about 30 meters and will be 
reaching 100 m in height in a few short weeks.  

59
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
At low tide, the ocean recedes hundreds of 
kilometers, exposing the continental shelf  

60
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,019
like vast deserts, while at high tide walls of 
water drown agriculture, houses and skyscrapers.

61
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,320
And now, almost five months in, the 
apocalypse has finished its warm-up act.

62
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,880
Since the oceans are on average only 3 kilometers 
deep, the tides have reached their maximum. Up  

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,600
until now, the water in the oceans could flow, 
absorbing most of the moon's gravitational  

64
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,800
squeezing, but now the earth itself is really 
feeling the squeeze of the ever approaching moon.  

65
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,120
These aren’t so much tides of ‘water’, but 
tides of ‘rock.’ The squeezing of the planet,  

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,240
combined with the weight of quintillions of tons 
of water sloshing on and off the tectonic plates,  

67
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,840
creates enormous stresses below and begins to 
cause earthquakes of increasing magnitude and  

68
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,200
intensity. It’s impossible to say how serious 
these earthquakes might be or where they occur,  

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,280
but like a child jumping on their bed 
until it breaks, no good can come of it.

70
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,720
Strong tidal forces lead to volcanism 
on other planets and moons. On earth,  

71
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
squeezing the planet disrupts the 
magma reservoirs inside the crust,  

72
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,800
triggering sizable, climate-altering eruptions in 
Chile, New Zealand, Yellowstone, and elsewhere.

73
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,320
Meanwhile, watching patiently above is the moon. 
Still no bigger in the sky than a small cloud.  

74
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,037
Within 75,000 km of earth, it is bright enough 
to illuminate the night sky like twilight.

75
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,720
Month 6 - 7

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,360
After half a year, the moon is entering the space 
once occupied by geosynchronous satellites where  

77
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,120
it orbits earth every 24 hours. It appears 
to float at one spot in the sky, unmoving,  

78
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,680
cycling through a full set of phases every 
day, but only visible to half the planet.  

79
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,720
With the moon ‘stationary’ above the 
earth, the tides seem to freeze in  

80
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,760
place – half the world flooded, half with 
its water seemingly returned to the sea,  

81
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,560
as if Earth is holding its 
breath to prepare for the worst.

82
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,400
As the moon sinks further, you might wonder if 
its gravity would overpower Earth’s, pulling you 

83
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,520
up and ending your misery? Fortunately not.  

84
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,920
The earth’s surface gravity is about 
6 times stronger than the moon’s,  

85
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,240
so even if the moon were hovering right on top 
of you, you would still stay on the ground.

86
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,160
On the moon things are different though: the near 
side of the moon is more strongly affected by  

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,280
earth’s gravity, so during the next few months, it 
starts to stretch forward towards the earth, into  

88
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,360
something of an egg, triggering deep moonquakes 
as the lunar rock flexes and changes shape. Though  

89
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,560
barely noticeable now, this ‘squish’ will grow 
to hundreds of kilometers in a matter of months.

90
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,960
Month 8 - 11

91
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,440
At this point the apocalypse has arrived and 
we can summarize the months before the crash  

92
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,600
as “everybody left has a really bad time”. 
The tides sweeping over the Earth slow down  

93
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,800
and then reverse their direction because the 
moon now orbits earth faster than it rotates.

94
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,360
The planet will experience an abundance of 
earthquakes and volcanism. Massive amounts of  

95
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,720
volcanic aerosols rise high into the stratosphere, 
shiny enough to reflect sunlight back into space.  

96
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,640
What little light gets through is rust-red and 
is periodically diminished by daily eclipses.  

97
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,200
The result is a rapid global cooling, with 
acid rains and summer snows killing even  

98
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,200
the hardiest plants.The clock runs out 
on civilization. Billions have perished  

99
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,480
while an egg-shaped moon is still drawing 
closer. Let’s get ready for the grand finale.

100
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,559
Month 12

101
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,051
Finally, at the end of the year,, the moon 
has reached the Roche limit. That’s the point  

102
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:56,800
where Earth’s gravitational pull on the Moon is 
stronger than the Moon’s own gravity. Things on  

103
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,320
the lunar surface start falling towards Earth 
and by the time it crosses 10,000 km the entire  

104
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,840
moon disintegrates into rubble, smearing itself 
into a massive ring system around the earth.

105
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,560
Fortunately, the moon’s disintegration 
means the misery on Earth has ended.  

106
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,760
No moon means the general apocalyptic nature 
of things comes to a halt. The oceans recede,  

107
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,840
flowing off the land one last time.

108
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,240
Any survivors are treated to a view 
of tremendous arches spanning the sky,  

109
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,640
glimmering in the sunlight, illuminating 
the night sky more brilliantly than any  

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,720
full moon ever could, while meteor 
showers of moondust fill the sky.

111
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,440
It’s hard to say what happens next, 
but the tranquility may be short-lived.  

112
00:09:42,0042 --> 00:09:47,047
If too much moondust rains down, friction 
heats the atmosphere – possibly boiling the  

113
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:51,440
oceans. If not, the enormous 
shadows cast by the rings,  

114
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,480
combined with all the volcanic and meteoric 
aerosols, block even more sunlight,  

115
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,840
and a period of runaway cooling could begin 
that freezes much of earth’s surface solid.

116
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,0010
In any case, at some point people will 
emerge again – from submarines or bunkers  

117
00:10:10,0010 --> 00:10:16,720
or mountaintops. They will not have a great time 
before rebuilding civilization and their success  

118
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,0022
is not guaranteed – but at least they will 
try to do so with beautiful rings in the sky.

119
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,280
So how do you calculate that sort of thing? Well,  

120
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,680
you just need a bit of insanity and some 
maths. If you need to brush on the latter:  

121
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,480
Our friends from Brilliant are the perfect coaches 
to turn your curiosity into practical skills.

122
