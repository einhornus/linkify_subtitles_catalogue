1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,058
Electricity is all around us all the time.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,579
It makes our lives easier, safer, more fun,

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,359
and most of us never think about it.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,359
But are we using too much electricity?

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,179
Is it possible that the foundation of our modern world

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:29,359
is slowly killing us?

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,159
Before going deeper,

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,659
let's try to understand what electricity is

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,959
and how it affects us.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,399
Electricity is the movement of an electric charge.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,579
This movement generates electric and magnetic fields

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,039
that disperse through space and carry energy.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,219
This phenomenon is called "electromagnetic radiation".

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,959
"Radiation" is a very nervous word.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,859
But to radiate simply means to "emit."

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,419
As when your home's radiator gives off heat

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,279
in the form of infrared radiation.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,039
Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,439
correspond to different types of radiation.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,959
And many of them are perfectly harmless.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,439
However, some can be dangerous

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,639
Very short wavelength radiation,

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,959
such as UV rays, X-rays and gamma rays,

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,879
is strong enough to tear electrons from their atoms,

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,039
which can cause burns and genetic damage

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,319
This is what  that many people have in mind when they hear the term "radiation".

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,599
The rest of the spectrum covers a wide range of other wavelengths

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,319
from visible light, infrared, microwaves

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,879
to radio waves.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,639
This is the type of radiation emitted by all kinds of technology

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,039
Cell phones, Wi-Fi routers,

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,959
power lines, and household appliances.

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,279
This type of radiation does not disturb the molecules of our body.

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,359
However, certain types of radiation can stimulate muscles and nerves as

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,199
well as vibrate the hairs on your body,

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,759
which can sometimes cause tingling above certain values.

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,079
Other types are useful for preparing

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,039
food Microwaves circulate the water molecules in your food

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,959
which heats it up

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,859
This happens to us all the time.

41
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,499
For example, the pleasant warmth you feel at the beach

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,799
is that of your skin being warmed by the presence of infrared radiation emitted by the sun.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,119
We are surrounded by sources of natural, and generally harmless, electromagnetic radiation all the time,

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,439
and always have been.

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,519
But since the industrial revolution

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,199
we have added many in our immediate environment.

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,294
Whether it's really

48
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:38,044
dangerous first came to public attention when a 1979 study

49
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:41,119
linked leukemia to living near power lines.

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,519
But this study was soon discredited.

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,919
The connection could not be explained

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,719
and no causal link could be confirmed.

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,839
But once it was suggested,

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,159
the idea persisted,

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,694
and thousands of studies of potential dangers

56
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:59,359
show that it is still seen as a real threat.

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,119
Many people claim to be sensitive to the radiation

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,279
emitted by our phones and other devices.

59
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,019
They report symptoms such as headaches,

60
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,524
nausea, skin reactions, eye burns or fatigue,

61
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,004
but these are only day-to-day effects.

62
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:18,424
A few studies have found much more disturbing results

63
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:21,014
as a possible link between the part of the brain

64
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:23,744
used when you're on your phone

65
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,999
and the development of brain tumors.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,399
The question science is trying to answer

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,799
is not so much about the acute effects of radiation.

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,559
We know, for example,

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,279
that X-rays cause immediate DNA damage in our cells

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,339
but that radio waves do not produce the same effect.

71
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,119
The question is rather:

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,859
does this kind of weak electromagnetic radiation that surrounds us  constantly

73
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,759
is harmful in the long term due to phenomena that are still unknown?

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,924
Answering this question was much more difficult than we thought.

75
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,604
There are thousands of primary sources

76
00:03:56,605 --> 00:04:00,559
, reports and statements made by many different organizations.

77
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,424
So we read a lot for this video.

78
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:06,194
You can take a look at our research in the description

79
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,954
What we found is that this debate is a good example

80
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:12,559
of how science should be communicated, and how it shouldn't be

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,479
Many of the most popular studies  quotes that sow panic about electromagnetic radiation

82
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,039
are highly controversial

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,059
For example:

84
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,759
a series of population studies based on polls and self-reports

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,119
Which means that, for example,

86
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,399
asking patients with brain tumors how long  they think they've spent on their phone for the past few years.

87
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,159
The problem is that people are unreliable

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,419
We tend to misremember things or can be swayed easily

89
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,199
In addition to this

90
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,559
, studies or news reports can select results that support their views

91
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,879
or will make headlines  best selling

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,799
For example,

93
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,319
a study looking for cancer in rats and mice due to phone radiation

94
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,039
The results seemed to show a connection

95
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,719
But, for some obscure reason, only in male rats

96
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,599
and absolutely none in mice

97
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,519
but it was  publicized as if the study proves

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,399
that cell phone radiation causes cancer

99
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,399
Unfortunately, this is the case for studies showing both positive and negative results on the problem

100
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,419
Another aspect is that the WHO has officially classified the fields  radiation

101
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,579
as potentially carcinogenic

102
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,559
But what that really means

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,359
is that there are a few clues that suggest it may  may be carcinogenic

104
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,979
but we can't prove it and we'll keep an eye on

105
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,999
it So, taking a step back, what's the big picture?

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,819
Altogether,

107
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,619
there has been no consistent evidence in human studies

108
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,119
that exposure to electromagnetic radiation below the limit values causes health problems There

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,319
are some correlations but t

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,719
ey are generally weak and incon

111
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,679
istent  If there were real cause and effect relationships

112
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,679
we would already know, thanks to all the data we have

113
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,179
So according to the current state of science

114
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,839
should you be worried about the radiation emitted by your computer  , your phone, or your TV?

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,659
The answer is no.

116
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,159
You should not.

117
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,799
But what about people who claim it harms them?

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,999
Research shows they can experience what's called the Nocebo Effect.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,019
If you have a headache and feel better right after turning off your computer,

120
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,599
you might see a connection between these two events.

121
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,319
Once you have that suspicion, the very idea that low radiation might harm you

122
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,759
might be the thing that hurts you.

123
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,959
It's easy to put these people down;

124
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,399
most of them do not feel taken seriously

125
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,559
, which aggravates their situation.

126
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,119
They should be supported

127
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,519
But, it is important to be aware that, so far,

128
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,799
we have no solid evidence that electricity below safe limits has a negative impact on humans

129
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,839
In the economy of the world.  he attention we live in,

130
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,959
talking about potential unproven dangers can cause us to overlook other things that we know are actually dangerous to us.

131
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,719
Just one example

132
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,159
: Outdoor air pollution is responsible for 4.2 million premature deaths every  years

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,399
and it's clearly something we could act against today

134
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,319
However, to reassure people, and just to be really sure

135
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,399
There are already several long studies in progress

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,319
For example, the "Cosmos" study which  is testing the potential impacts of phone use on our hearts

137
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,699
by measuring the frequency and duration of phone calls,

138
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,519
but while we wait for the conclusion of this long-term study,

139
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,526
there are many more issues.  my urgents that we could focus on

140
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:27,027
"squeak"
