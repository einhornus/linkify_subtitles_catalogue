00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,919
Rogue planets are planets that travel through the universe alone.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,819
They inhabit the dark and vast space between the stars.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,019
Drifting alone through eternal darkness, no light warms their surfaces,

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,289
and they're exposed to the freezing cold of outer space.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,519
They know no seasons, no days, and no nights,
which could give away the passing of time.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,739
And yet, rogue planets might carry alien life

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,869
to all corners of the galaxy.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,129
How would that work?

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:37,739
And how does a planet become a rogue anyway?

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,349
[Music]

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,179
There are several very different things that get called rogue planets.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,229
For example, sub-brown dwarfs
-- gas giants that form from collapsing gas clouds

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,909
and are the boring little brothers of brown dwarfs.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,609
They're a sort of failed star,

15
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,759
and we'll now stop talking about them.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,079
A far more interesting sort of rogue,
are terrestrial planets, similar to Earth,

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,719
that got kicked out of their planetary system.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,579
Young star systems are dangerous places,

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,439
where protoplanets are battling for the available mass,

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,199
guzzling up as much material as possible.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,999
In this fight for dominance, they collide with each other,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,869
or get dangerously close to each other's orbits.

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,349
If a very massive planet moves its orbit closer to the star,

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,229
it can kick smaller planets out of the system.

25
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,759
But just because a planet has survived the growing pains of formation,

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,599
doesn't mean it's safe.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119
Planetary systems can be disrupted by flybys from stars,

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,279
or black holes, at any point.

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,169
Up to half of all planets born could end up as rogues.

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,159
Scientists don't agree on the numbers,

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,029
but it's likely that, at the very least,

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,599
there are billions of rogue planets in the Milky Way alone.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,479
Most rogues will share the same depressing fate,

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,069
as their star becomes smaller, day by day,

35
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,899
the planet's surface quickly cools down to minus 270 degrees Celsius.

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,619
If they have oceans, they'll freeze and become as hard as bedrock.

37
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,559
Their atmospheres will sink down to the surface
and eventually freeze, too.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,719
But, weirdly enough,

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,689
some of these frozen, dark deserts could harbor life.

40
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,669
To understand how, let's imagine a planet similar to Earth,

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,219
in the same order of magnitude in terms of mass and composition.

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,729
If we put it into deep space, how could it still support life?

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,309
As far as we understand the nature of life,

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,189
there is one indispensable ingredient it needs: liquid water.

45
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,289
Water is important because it mixes things,

46
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,939
both matter and energy,

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,109
which lets interesting chemistry happen, like life.

48
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,999
So our planet needs enough energy

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,319
to keep at least a part of our oceans warm enough

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,229
to sustain liquid water.

51
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,819
Annoyingly, about 99.97% of Earth's energy budget comes from the Sun.

52
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,579
So our imaginary rogue earth needs to work

53
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,879
with the 0.03 percent of energy it has left,

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,469
which almost exclusively comes from its hot center.

55
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,989
Earth's inner core is a giant metal ball,

56
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,039
about as hot as the surface of the Sun,

57
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,069
that's surrounded by the outer core made up of liquid metals

58
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,249
that are very, very slowly solidifying

59
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,859
releasing a lot of heat in the process.

60
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,029
As long as this process is ongoing,

61
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,219
our planet will be geologically active

62
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,629
with solid and liquid material moving around

63
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,619
and transporting energy to the surface

64
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,489
where it can be harnessed as geothermal energy.

65
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,699
While the hot core of every planet will cool off eventually,

66
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,129
this process takes billions of years.

67
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,519
Enough time for life to come into existence and thrive.

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,599
There's even one scenario that could allow

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,859
an Earth-like planet to have oceans that are not frozen over.

70
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,189
If the planet had an extremely dense
and high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere,

71
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,559
the gas would not freeze

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,309
and could trap enough of the heat trying to escape the planet

73
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,019
to enable oceans that extend all the way to the surface.

74
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,629
And there's another possible way to stay warm: moons.

75
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,169
If a rogue planet brings a moon or more along with them,

76
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,539
a large enough moon could inject additional energy into the system

77
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,269
via tidal forces.

78
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,919
These forces stretch and squeeze the planet a little bit every day,

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,629
like kneading dough, keeping it warm.

80
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,578
But the most likely scenario for a rogue bearing life

81
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,679
is one with sub-glacial oceans 

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,729
under a kilometer thick layer of mostly water ice.

83
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,679
These are not completely absurd,
since we already have a few of them in the Solar System.

84
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,699
So how could life sustain itself
at the bottom of a completely dark, cold ocean.

85
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,589
On Earth, deep down in our oceans in complete darkness,

86
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,199
in volcanically-active areas,

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,519
there are hydrothermal vents called black smokers.

88
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,659
They spew out a cloud of black material and hot water

89
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,619
providing a constant flow of minerals from Earth's mantle.

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,219
Bacteria feed on the minerals and produce organic materials,

91
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,509
which attracts crustaceans, bivalves, snails,

92
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,799
fish, octopus, and tube worms up to 2 meters long.

93
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,229
Not only are hydrothermal vents home
to an incredibly diverse group of living beings,

94
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,669
but also a contender for the place
where life could have begun on Earth

95
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,619
billions of years ago.

96
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,069
In the dark ocean of a rogue planet,
similar events or volcanic activity,

97
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,909
could be the starting point and basis

98
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,899
for complex ecosystems we can only imagine right now.

99
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,979
One upside an ecosystem in a rogue planet ocean has,

100
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,179
is that the environment is extremely stable.

101
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,359
The thick ice sheet protects it
from all sorts of extinction events,

102
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,069
and, as long as the energy from the core keeps on coming,

103
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,809
things stay pretty much the same.

104
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,199
The most likely forms of life
are bacteria and other microorganisms.

105
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,529
But, given enough time,

106
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,959
more complex alien animals could feed
on the smaller beings and thrive.

107
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,409
It's not impossible that intelligent life
could emerge in such an environment.

108
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,599
If it did, it would find itself in a pretty weird world.

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,199
Constricted by an impassable wall of rock-hard ice at the top,

110
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,859
and bedrock at the bottom.

111
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,119
Without any plants to store star energy,

112
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,129
there would be no wood, oil, or coal.

113
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,589
Even if there were,
it's not like you'd discover fire at the bottom of an ocean.

114
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,379
Without this energy, metals may never be forged into useful things.

115
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,239
Our intelligent alien friends might never break through the ice.

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,779
They might never realize that there is such a thing as outside,

117
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,089
and assumed that their small world is all there is.

118
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,809
Millions of generations might live and die in these dark oceans,

119
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,159
ignorant of the unbelievably big universe above the ice.

120
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,479
Until the core of their planet cools off,

121
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,959
and all life vanishes.

122
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,999
As the oceans completely freeze,

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,579
the remnants of cultures and ecosystems

124
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,239
will be trapped in an icy grave forever.

125
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,519
If you think about it,
it might be better not to be aware of all that.

126
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,389
But the concept is disturbing and exciting.

127
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,689
The universe might be teeming with life,

128
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,209
trapped on planets that are basically impossible to leave.

129
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,169
Worlds like this could frequently pass the Solar System,
without us even knowing.

130
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,549
Maybe one day, in the far future,

131
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,719
humans will set foot on one of these frozen worlds

132
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,979
and try to say "hello."

133
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,019
Okay, so we love gloomy future scenarios,

134
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,199
but let's go back to the present
for a different kind of surprise.

135
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,429

136
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,089
so we made a video about that.

137
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,199
