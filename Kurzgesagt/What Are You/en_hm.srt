1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,019
Are you your body?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,179
Well, kind of, right?

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,719
But is there a line where this stops being true?

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,179
How much of yourself can you remove, before you stop being you?

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:26,059
And does the question even make sense?

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,659
Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them,

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,039
at least ten times more than there are stars in the milky way.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,799
A cell is a living being, a machine make of up to 50,000 different proteins.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,179
It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose; it just is. But it is still an individual.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,999
Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,619
gathering resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the enviroment, and so on.

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,318
If you extract cells from your body, and put them in the right enviroment, they will continue to stay alive for a while.

13
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:11,019
So, your cells can exist without you, but you can't exist without them.

14
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,419
If we take all the cells away, there is no 'you' anymore.

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,719
Is there a line where a pile of your cells stops being you?

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,919
For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will continue to live on inside someone else.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,139
Does this mean that a part of you became a part of another person?

18
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,919
Or is this other body keeping a part of you alive?

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,179
Or let us imagine an experiment: you and a random person from the street exchange cells.

20
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,499
One at a time, your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells.

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,019
At which point would they become you?

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,659
Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport you?

23
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,099
Let's make this more complicated!

24
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,179
The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable.

25
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,479
Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime.

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,499
250 million have died since the beginning of this video alone.

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,439
Between one and three million per second.

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,759
In a seven year period most of your cells are replaced at least once.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,539
Everytime you cells set up changes, you are slightly different than before.

30
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,239
So, a part of you is dying contantly.

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,219
If you are lucky enough to become old, you would have cycled through roughly a million billion cells.

32
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,139
So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot.

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,939
But sometimes, cells are broken and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies.

34
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,379
We call them cancer.

35
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:51,199
They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal.

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,879
Cancer is not an outside invader; it's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,779
But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes an other entity inside us -

38
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,319
another being that just wants to thrive and survive.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,439
Can we blame it for that?

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,679
A chilling cell story, is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951.

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,699
Usually, cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard.

42
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,279
Henrietta's cancer cells were immortal.

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,879
Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and used for countless research projects,

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,679
saving countless lives.

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,739
Henrietta's cells are still alive, and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass.

46
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,539
So, there are living parts around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades.

47
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,739
How much of Henrietta is in these cells?

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,519
What makes one of your cells you, anyway?

49
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,439
Maybe the information contained in it: your DNA.

50
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,799
Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically the same genetic code.

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,739
But it turns out this is wrong.

52
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,179
Your genome is mobile, changing over time through mutations and environmental influences.

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,559
This is especially the case in your brain.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,519
According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more than one thousand mutations

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,199
in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it.

56
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,679
But how much you is your DNA really?

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,259
About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our ancestors and merged with us.

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,959
Mitochondria, power plants of the cell, once were bacteria, that merged with the ancestors of your cells.

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,559
They still have their own DNA

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,299
An average cell has hundreds of them, hundreds of little things that are not really human, but they still kind of are.

61
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,899
It is confusing.

62
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,419
Let's backtrack a bit.

63
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,899
We know that you're made up of trillions of little things,

64
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,339
made from more little things, that are constantly changing.

65
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,239
Together, all those little things are not static, but dynamic.

66
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,979
Their composition and condition is changing constantly.

67
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,779
So, we might just be a self-sustaining pattern, without clear borders,

68
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,419
that gained self awareness at some point, and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space,

69
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,339
but really only exists in this exact very moment.

70
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,519
Where did this pattern start?

71
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,619
With your conception? When the first human arose?

72
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,819
When life first began conquering our small planet?

73
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,019
Or when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star?

74
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,619
Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes.

75
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,259
The fuzzy borders that make up reality are hard to grasp.

76
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:45,199
Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death, you and me, are really not absolutes,

77
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:54,699
but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern, a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful universe.

78
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:01,079
The problem of who we are isn't just a question about ourselves, but it is also a question of our minds.

79
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,299
Just as our cells can be divided and separated from us, so can our very brains be divided and separated from us -

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,119
while still in the skull...

Okay, so now go watch CGPGrey's video.

If you're not yet subscribed to his channel, you should really change that now.
