1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,079
Never before in history, have there been so many people on Earth as right now.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:20,579
Our numbers have skyrocketed, from 1 billion in 1800, to 2.3 billion in 1940, 3.7 billion in 1970, and 7.4 billion in 2016.

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,019
The world population increased fourfold in the last century, so what can we expect for the next century?

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,779
And what does population growth mean for our future?

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,758
Will there be mass-migration?

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,199
Overcrowded slums and megacities covering continents?

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,019
Diseases and pollution?

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,779
Chaos and violence over energy, water, and food?

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,519
And a human species focused only on sustaining itself?

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,359
Will population growth destroy our way of life?

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:01:02,959
Or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic?

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,619
In the 1960s population growth reached an unprecedented rate.

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,419
Which lead to apocalyptic prophecies.

14
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,939
The poor would pro-create endlessly and overrun the developed world.

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,879
The legend of overpopulation was born.

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,239
But it turns out high birth rates and the population explosion are not permanent features of some cultures or countries,

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,479
But rather a part of a four step process the whole world is going through,

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,799
The demographic transition.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,959
Most developed countries have already made the transition, while other countries are doing it right now.

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,859
Let's go back to the 18th century, when the entire world, including Europe, was in the first stage of the demographic transition.

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:54,299
By today's standards, Europe was worse off, than a developing region, suffering from poor sanitation, poor diets, and poor medicine.

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,299
A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast, so the population hardly grew.

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,059
Women had between 4 and 6 children, but only 2 of them would reach adulthood.

24
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:14,259
Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK and bought the greatest change in human living conditions since the agricultural revolution.

25
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,579
People went from being peasants to workers.

26
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,799
Manufactured goods were mass produced and became widely available.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,439
The sciences flourished and advanced transportation, communication, and medicine.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,439
The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation.

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:43,019
Slowly this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raised standards of living and health care for the poor working population.

30
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,939
The second transition stage started.

31
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,979
Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine, meant people stopped dying all the time, especially so, at a very young age.

32
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,699
The result was a population explosion.

33
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,459
Doubling the UK's population between 1750 and 1850.

34
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,979
The main reasons families used to have lots of children was that only a few of them were likely to survive.

35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,399
Now that had changed, so the third stage of transition was set in motion.

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,059
Fewer babies were conceived, and population growth slowed down.

37
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:23,019
Eventually a balance emerged, fewer people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable.

38
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,459
Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition.

39
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:33,019
This didn't only happen in the UK, more and more countries went through the four stages.

40
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,799
First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions.

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,739
Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion.

42
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,799
Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births, and population growth came to an end.

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,199
But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population still growing so fast?

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,639
Well, the children born in the population explosion of the 70s and 80s are having kids themselves now.

45
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,819
Leading to a noticeable spike in overall population.

46
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,539
But they are having far fewer children on average than their parents.

47
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,359
The average today is 2.5, it was 5, 40 years ago.

48
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,999
So as this generation gets older, and fertility declines further, the rate of population growth will keep on slowing.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,479
This is true for every country.

50
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,119
In the west, we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world.

51
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,379
But actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage.

52
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:36,519
Just look at Bangladesh. In 1971, the average woman had 7 kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of 5.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,359
In 2015, the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average.

54
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,679
This is the rule, not an exception, we're not special, we just had a head start.

55
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,219
It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 children, to less than 3.

56
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,599
Others are catching up fast. Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years; Bangladesh took just 20.

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,979
Iran managed it in 10 years.

58
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,559
All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch and the more support they get, the faster they catch up.

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,479
This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop, are so important,

60
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:25,219
No matter what your motivation is, whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth, or you just want fewer refugees coming into your country,

61
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:32,379
The simple truth is, that it's beneficial to you personally if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life.

62
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:40,059
And we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today.

63
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,179
So the future of global population growth is not an apocalyptic prophecy, it's a promise!

64
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,979
Population growth will come to an end.

65
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,399
The UN forecasts that the 12th billionth human will never be born at all.

66
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,859
And as the development level of the world rises, the number of people a higher education will increase tenfold.

67
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,999
Countries who used to be a need, will help advance development instead.

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,939
More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.

69
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:23,059
