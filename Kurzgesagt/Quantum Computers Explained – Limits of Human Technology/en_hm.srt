Quantum Computers Explained â€“ Limits of Human Technology

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,119
For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,159
While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons,

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,279
the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,379
Since the 1960's, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially,

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,939
allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,499
But this process is about to meet its physical limits.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,859
Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,179
To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,719
In a Nutshell - By Kurzgesagt

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,539
A computer is made up of very simple components

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,219
doing very simple things.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,019
Representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,639
Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,439
A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers,

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,259
basically a switch that can either block, or open the way for information coming through.

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,339
This information is made up of bits

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,499
which can be set to either 0 or 1.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,999
Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,999
Transistors are combined to create logic gates which still do very simple stuff.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,459
For example, an AND Gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and a output of 0 otherwise.

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,999
Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say, for adding two numbers.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,759
Once you can add, you can also multiply,

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,159
and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,039
Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first grade math,

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,079
you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,679
A large enough bunch of them could compute anything

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,339
from astrophysics to Zelda.

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,739
However, with parts getting tinier and tinier,

30
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,539
quantum physics are making things tricky.

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,979
In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,159
Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another.

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,359
So, a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,219
Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometers,

35
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,519
which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter,

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,399
and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms,

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,919
electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,499
via a process called Quantum Tunneling.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,259
In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to,

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,859
and traditional computers just stop making sense.

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,219
We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress.

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,899
To solve this problem,

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,099
scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage

45
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,179
by building quantum computers.

46
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,419
In normal computers, bits are the smallest unit of information.

47
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,059
Quantum computers use qubits which can also be set to one of two values.

48
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,859
A qubit can be any two level quantum system,

49
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,659
such as a spin and a magnetic field, or a single photon.

50
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,579
0 and 1 are this system's possible states,

51
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,959
like the photons horizontal or vertical polarization.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,519
In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be just one of those,

53
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,899
it can be in any proportions of both states at once.

54
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,899
This is called superposition.

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,679
But as soon as you test its value, say, by sending the photon through a filter,

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,139
it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized.

57
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,059
So as long as it's unobserved,

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,139
the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for 0 and 1, and you can't predit which it'll be.

59
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,139
But the instant you measure it,

60
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,439
it collapses into one of the definite states.

61
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,599
Superposition is a game changer.

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,379
Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time.

63
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,699
That's 16 possible combinations, out of which you can use just one.

64
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,379
Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once.

65
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,479
This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit.

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,239
Twenty of them can already store a million values in parallel.

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,879
A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is Entanglement,

68
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,119
a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other's state instantaneously,

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,199
no matter how far they are apart.

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,139
This means when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of it's partners

71
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,679
without having to look.

72
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,159
Qubit Manipulation is a mind bender as well.

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,439
A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output.

74
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,679
A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities,

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,959
and produces another superposition as its output.

76
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,459
So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,

77
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,619
then finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of 0s and 1s.

78
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,219
What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup, all done at the same time.

79
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,359
Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results and it'll only probably be the one you want,

80
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,399
so you may have to double check and try again.

81
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,959
But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement,

82
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,499
this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer.

83
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,919
So, while quantum computers will not probably not replace our home computers,

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,559
in some areas, they are vastly superior.

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,799
One of them is database searching.

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,819
To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries.

87
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,099
Quantum computers algorithms need only the square root of that time,

88
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,459
which for large databases, is a huge difference

89
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,639
The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security.

90
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,079
Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system

91
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,499
in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode.

92
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,119
The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key.

93
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,559
Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error.

94
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,439
But a quantum computer with exponential speed-up could do it in a breeze.

95
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,459
Another really exciting new use is simulations.

96
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,019
Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources,

97
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,019
and even for bigger structures, such as molecules, they often lack accuracy.

98
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,339
So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics?

99
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,319
Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine.

100
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,499
Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a specallized tool,

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,759
or a big revolution for humanity.

102
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,799
We have no idea where the limits of technology are,

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,539
and there's only one way to find out.
