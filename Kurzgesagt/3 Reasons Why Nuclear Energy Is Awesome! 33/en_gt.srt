1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:04,268
Three reasons why we continue to use nuclear energy :)

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:07,532
First, nuclear energy saves lives.

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:12,861
In a study conducted by NASA in 2013, nuclear energy

4
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,421
prevented about 1.8 million deaths.

5
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:18,554
Even including deaths from nuclear accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima,

6
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:23,808
nuclear energy has the lowest ranking of deaths per unit of production.

7
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:28,081
Although nuclear waste is very dangerous, it is usually stored somewhere.

8
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:32,225
However, by-products of fossil fuels are released into the air.

9
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:33,871
We breathe every day.

10
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:38,678
So, by reducing the use of fossil fuels, countless types of cancer

11
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,591
or lung disease and accidents in coal mines can be avoided.

12
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:46,729
The first seems more sensible if there is a choice between storing the high-risk material in a deep pit and

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,797
releasing it into the air, very very very very very dangerous

14
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:53,270
.

15
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:56,223
Nuclear energy still feels more dangerous.

16
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:01,928
One fatal event is imprinted in our memory, while coal and oil quietly kill.

17
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,241
This is similar to the death rate of flight accidents and traffic accidents.

18
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:08,859
Even the best-case scenario

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,588
would take 40 years to convert to 100% renewable energy.

20
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:16,551
So, while we use fossil fuels, nuclear energy

21
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:19,163
saves more lives than it destroys.

22
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:23,484
Second, nuclear energy reduces carbon dioxide emissions.

23
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:27,021
Nuclear energy is arguably less harmful to the environment.

24
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:31,330
In terms of climate change rather than fossil fuels, our main energy source.

25
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:36,293
Since 1976, 64 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases have

26
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:40,121
not been released into the air thanks to nuclear energy.

27
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:46,832
In addition, it will be 80-240 billion tonnes by the middle of the 21st century
.

28
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:50,272
Human energy consumption is steadily increasing.

29
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:54,285
According to the US government's forecast, China alone

30
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:59,079
would build one 600MW coal plant every 10 days for 10 years.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,371
China already burns 4 billion tonnes of coal annually.

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,148
Coal is cheap, relatively abundant and easy to obtain.

33
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,002
So, it is unlikely that humans will soon stop using it.

34
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:13,876
Nuclear energy is the only way to combat climate change.

35
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:17,859
And it prevents the catastrophic global warming caused by mankind.

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,438
Compared to other things we can do, nuclear energy is relatively clean.

37
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,956
So, if you have a good idea of not using nuclear energy in the long run, it wi

38
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,650
l be a good solution for 100 years or so.  

39
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:31,052
compared to other energy sources.

40
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:33,580
Third: New technologies

41
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:39,086
Perhaps new technologies will solve the problems of nuclear waste and hazardous nuclear power plants.

42
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:43,687
Most of the reactor technologies used so far are outdated.

43
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:47,080
This is because technological innovation related to nuclear technology stopped in the 1970s.

44
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,151
An example is the thorium reactor, which

45
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,855
solves all the problems at once.

46
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:55,002
Thorium is abundant and difficult to use as a nuclear weapon.

47
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:59,949
It is 100 times less wasteful than current nuclear reactors.

48
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,819
Waste material is only dangerous for a few hundred years,

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,526
whereas nuclear reactors are only dangerous for about 2000 years.

50
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:10,200
One ton of thorium is estimated to provide the same energy as 200 tonnes of uranium or 3.5 million tonnes of coal

51
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:14,829
.

52
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,302
Since it's unclear whether alternative nuclear technology will deliver on its promise, can't

53
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:21,280
we do more research

54
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,796
to advance our chances of solving humanity's current problems?

55
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:29,972
It's not an easy challenge, but that doesn't stop us.

56
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:33,158
So, should we use nuclear energy?

57
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,682
There are dangers in the great passions of man.

58
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:40,290
And we must make well-thought-out decisions rather than relying on intuition.

59
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,511
