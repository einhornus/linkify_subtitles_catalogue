1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,018
Consciousness is perhaps the biggest riddle in nature.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,099
Stripped to its core meaning,

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,919
consciousness is what allows us to be aware
both of our surroundings and of our own inner state.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,819
But thinking about consciousness has
this habit of taking us round in circles.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,919
We all intuitively know what consciousness is.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,659
It's this...

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,839
It's what you're experiencing here, right now.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,599
But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is,
it leaves us grasping at thin air.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,799
And not just us, philosophers and scientists
struggle to define consciousness.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,939
Different schools and ideas compete with one another,
but no one has come close to figuring it out.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:54,639
It's unsettling to realise that we don't understand
what makes us aware of ourselves and the world.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,359
In this fuzzy area, consciousness and intelligence
are also related, although they are not the same.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,059
We'll talk in greater depth about theories of consciousness and intelligence in other videos.

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,159
Like much of what makes us human,

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,199
our consciousness is likely to have
evolved from less complex forms,

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,119
as a product of evolution by natural selection.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,279
It has probably emerged from an immense several
100 million years sequence of countless micro steps,

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,559
that together make up a sort of
gradient of consciousness.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,239
What was the first step on this
path from the non-conscious

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,399
to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today?

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:49,199
[Intro]

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,539
Take a stone.

23
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:57,479
The consensus is that a stone is not conscious.
Though, not everyone agrees even on this.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,919
Some panpsychists claim that
a lump of rock may have an inner life.

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,679
However, there are no real grounds for any such
assumption since stones never show behaviour.

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,399
Their inner life can neither be proven nor disproven.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,819
A more common starting point is with the living things.

28
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:24,499
A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe
that sustains itself and makes more of its kind.

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,279
To do so, it needs energy.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,179
And this is where an awareness
of the world comes in handy.

31
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,623
The original function of consciousness was probably
to direct a mobile self that was short of energy

32
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:41,799
to a fresh supply of food.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,179
On the smaller scales of life,
you don't need to be aware to find food.

34
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,359
Trichopax adhaerens - one of the simplest
of all animals moves around haphazardly.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,259
It slows down in the presence of food,
and speeds up in its absence.

36
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,499
This is highly effective, and makes the tiny creature
spend more time where there is food

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,499
spend more time where there is food
than where there is not.

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,239
But it never moves in a particular 
direction towards a particular target,

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,679
and there's no need for it to be
conscious of its environment.

40
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,419
The first major step towards consciousness

41
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,459
was probably taken when mobile selves
started to move themselves directionally.

42
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:31,179
Moving towards what was good for them, 
say food, and away from what was less good,

43
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,019
say someone else who thought that they were food.

44
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,139
Take Dugesia tigrina - a tiny worm
known for its funny face.

45
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,779
Sometimes the worm is hungry, and sometimes not.

46
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,719
This means that when it moves,

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,759
the worm self is not simply producing an
automatic response to an external stimulus,

48
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,959
but that its actions depend
upon its inner, physiological state,

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,619
whether it's hungry or sated.

50
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,579
When it's just eaten,
the worm is less energetic,

51
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:08,219
but when starved for a while,
it will move itself in the direction of tasty things.

52
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,439
It uses chemoreceptors on its head
to smell its environment,

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,799
and guide it in the direction
where the scent of food is strongest.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:24,619
After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads
back to a dark sheltered spot to digest it in safety,

55
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,719
until it's hungry again.

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,179
But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell
don't have a concrete objective in view.

57
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,759
They still lack any sense of where they are heading.

58
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,419
So, the next step on the ladder of consciousness
is to add some perception at a distance,

59
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,039
like vision.

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,539
Vision adds context and depth to our world.

61
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,279
With vision comes a sense of
the space we and our food exists in.

62
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,539
It adds a whole new dimension to awareness, and is
a huge step towards more familiar consciousness.

63
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:08,359
An optical apparatus, like an eye, enables
us to visualise our goal and lock onto it.

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,439
But even at this stage, a self is only able
to pursue its food as long as it sees it.

65
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,279
So, the next logical step needs
to happen on the inside.

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,299
To visualise food in its absence, for example,

67
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,459
a self needs to create some sort of
inner representation of the world.

68
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,679
Now, an animal can continue looking for food,
even when it escapes its sensory range.

69
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,539
Because of this inner representation
of what is relevant in the world,

70
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,639
it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it.

71
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,699
Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with.

72
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,999
The ability to remember things has emerged.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,739
Thanks to memory, animals can be
distracted from the pursuit for a few seconds,

74
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,859
but quickly continue their path afterwards.

75
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,759
A related phenomenon is called 'object permanence'.

76
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,539
This describes our awareness that things
continue to exist even when we can't see them.

77
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:18,039
This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals
and birds, and perhaps other animals too.

78
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,239
Human babies tend to develop this ability
around the time they turn eight months,

79
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,179
while baby chickens show this ability
within a day or two of being born.

80
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,279
The capacity to remember a thing in its absence
suggests at least a basic sense of time.

81
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,419
A sense of time is a big step
on the ladder of consciousness.

82
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:46,679
It may also enable a self to look forward
from the present moment and anticipate the future.

83
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,919
Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put
in front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal

84
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,619
as a prize for holding back for a while.

85
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,679
This sort of delayed gratification means there is an
ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future,

86
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,319
which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans.

87
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,459
Western scrub jays are experts in delayed gratification.

88
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,819
They show an even more elaborate sense
of the future when they hide food in a cache

89
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,099
to retrieve it at a later date.

90
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,619
The scrub jays will even rehide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them.

91
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,399
This means that they know
that there are other hungry selves out there,

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,379
who are aware and see the world
from their own, different perspective.

93
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,639
Crafty scrub jays can sort of
read the mind of their fellow birds.

94
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,639
This ability to mind-read is crucial
for complex levels of consciousness.

95
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,039
By putting yourself in the position of others,
you can outsmart a rich competitor,

96
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,379
or empathise with a hungry friend.

97
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,719
Language takes the ability to read minds
and represent what is absent to a whole new level.

98
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,559
Words enable us to construct
hypotheses about the world,

99
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,559
make detailed plans, and to
communicate them with others.

100
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,999
Words enable us to think about ourselves
and our place in the universe,

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,279
and even about our own consciousness, which is something we'll be doing more in future videos.

102
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,619
So, what is the origin of our consciousness?

103
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,339
It probably began as the directed motion
of a hungry self towards a source of food.

104
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:33,099
With the survival benefits, this gave it over 
competitors that moved at random or not at all.

105
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,779
It probably all started with the urge for more food.

106
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,739
So, even with the sophisticated consciousness
that allows us to dream about space,

107
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,159
build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels,

108
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,619
it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking
about where we'll get our next meal.

109
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,199
Collectively, we've put so much thought
and ingenuity into getting food,

110
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,999
that we can now just get our food to
come to us with little conscious effort.

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,539
