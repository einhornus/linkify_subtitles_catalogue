1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,058
Everybody feels lonely from time to time

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,579
When we have no one to sit next to at lunch

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,919
When we move to a new city

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,519
or when nobody has time for us at the weekend.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,199
But over the last few decad es,

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,939
this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,459
In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year old say they often feel lonely.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,539
In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,579
We are living in the most connected time in human history,

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,699
and yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,379
Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,979
You can be filled by bliss by yourself, and hate every second surrounded by friends.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,519
Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,179
If you feel lonely,

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,459
you are lonely.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,439
A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk to people,

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,378
or how to behave around others.

18
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,659
But population-based studies have shown that social skills make

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,459
practically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections.

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,599
Loneliness can affect everybody.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
Money, fame,

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,499
power, beauty,

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,319
social skills, a great personalityâ€”

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,979
nothing can protect you against loneliness,

25
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:31,299
because it's part of your biology.

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,839
Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,479
Hunger make you pay attention to your physical needs;

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,019
loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs.

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,699
Your body cares about your social needs,

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,999
because millions of years ago,

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,179
it was a great indicator of how likely you were to survive.

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,719
Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration,

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,679
and for forming connections with each other.

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,719
Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,579
to recognize what others thought and felt, and to form and sustain social bonds.

36
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,258
Being social became part of our biology

37
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,659
You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people,

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,099
which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,839
Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm,

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,179
or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone.

41
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,579
Being together meant survival,

42
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,259
being alone meant death.

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,539
So it was crucial that you got along with others.

44
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,819
For you ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,019
was not being eaten by a lion,

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,779
but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded.

47
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,479
To avoid that, your body came up with "social pain".

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,379
Pain of this kind is is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection.

49
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:57,199
A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour that would isolate you.

50
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,959
Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,199
were more likely to change their behaviour when they got rejected,

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,239
and thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked out

53
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,579
and most likely died.

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,999
That's why rejections hurt,

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,979
and even more so, why loneliness is so painful.

56
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,719
These mechanisms for keeping us connected

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,019
worked great for most of our history,

58
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:29,779
until humans began building a new world for themselves

59
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,519
The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance.

60
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,959
Western culture began to focus on the individual.

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,479
Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages,

62
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,379
while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility.

63
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,979
This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution.

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,239
People left their villages and fields to enter factories.

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,679
Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve,

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,079
while cities grew.

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,679
As our world rapidly became modern,

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,919
this trend sped up more and more.

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,579
Today, we move vast distances for new jobs,

70
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,339
love, and education,

71
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,019
and leave our social net behind.

72
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,159
We meet fewer people in person,

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,359
and we meet them less often than in the past.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,239
In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from

75
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,199
3 in 1985 to 2 in 2011.

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,959
Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident.

77
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,819
You reach adulthood and become busy with work,

78
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,779
university,

79
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,519
romance,

80
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,019
kids,

81
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,399
and Netflix.

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,439
There's just not enough time.

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,879
The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends.

84
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,499
Until you wake up one day and you realise that you feel isolated,

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,399
that you yearn for close relationships.

86
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,839
But it's hard to find close relationships as adults,

87
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,359
and so, loneliness can become chronic.

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,759
While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships,

89
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,279
our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were 50,000 years ago

90
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,579
We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other.

91
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,839
large scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic loneliness

92
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,299
is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans

93
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,039
it makes you age quicker it makes cancer deadlier

94
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,424
Alzheimer's advance faster

95
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,594
your immune systems weaker

96
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:37,879
loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,439
and as deadly as smoking a pack of ciggarettes a day

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,384
the most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes

99
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:48,994
chronic it can become self sustaining

100
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,104
physical and social pain use

101
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:53,734
common mechanisms in your brain

102
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:54,664
both feel like a threat

103
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:57,704
and so social pain leads to immediate

104
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,054
and defensive behaviour

105
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:01,399
when it's inflicted on you

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,319
when loneliness becomes chronic

107
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,274
your brain goes into self preservation mode

108
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:10,434
it starts to see danger and hostility everywhere

109
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,124
but that's not all

110
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,204
some studies found that when you're lonely your brain is much more

111
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,154
receptive and alert to social signals

112
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:20,754
while at the same time it gets worse at

113
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,499
gets worse at interpreting them correctly

114
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,219
you pay more attention to others but you understand them less

115
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,059
the part of you brain that recognises faces

116
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,544
get out of tune and becomes more

117
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:34,584
likely to categorise neutral faces as hostile

118
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:37,459
which makes it distrustful of others

119
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,079
loneliness make you assume the worst about others intentions towards you

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,994
because of this perceived hostile world

121
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:49,184
you can become more self-centred to protect yourself

122
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:52,079
which can make you appear more cold unfriendly and

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,319
socially awkward than you really are

124
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,239
if loneliness has become a strong presence in your life

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,439
the first thing you can do is to try to recognise

126
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,439
vicious cycle you may be trapped in

127
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,079
it usually goes something like this

128
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,754
an initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings of

129
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,154
tension and sadness

130
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:17,094
which makes you focus you attention selectively on negative

131
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,279
interactions with others

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,619
this makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negative

133
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,994
which then changes your behaviour

134
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,724
you begin to avoid social interaction

135
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:31,639
which leads to more feelings of isolation

136
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,959
this cycle becomes more severe

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,579
and harder to escape each time

138
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,154
loneliness make you sit far away from others in class

139
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,694
not answer the phone when friends call

140
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,344
decline invitations until the invitations stop

141
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,914
each and every one of us has a story about

142
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:51,904
ourselves and if your story becomes that

143
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,699
people exclude you others pick up on that

144
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,019
and so the outside world can become the way you feel about it

145
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,639
this is often a slow creeping process that takes years

146
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,099
and can end in depression

147
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,519
and a mental state that can prevent connections even if you yearn for them

148
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,499
the first thing you can do to escape it is to accept

149
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,324
that loneliness is a totally normal feeling

150
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:17,794
and nothing to be ashamed of

151
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:20,804
literally everybody feels lonely at some point in their

152
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:24,524
life its a universal human experience

153
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,424
you can't eliminate or ignore a feeling until

154
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:30,194
it goes away magically but you can accept that

155
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:33,793
you feel it and get rid of its cause

156
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:37,144
you can self examine what you focus your attention on

157
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:39,913
and check if you are selectively focusing on

158
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:41,384
negative things

159
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:45,074
was this interaction with a colleague rarely negative

160
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:48,424
or was it really mutual or even positive

161
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:51,504
what was the actual content of an interaction?

162
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,339
what did the other person say?

163
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,234
did they say something bad or did you add

164
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,944
extra meaning to their words

165
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:02,164
maybe another person was not really reacting negatively but

166
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:04,804
just short on time

167
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:07,484
then there are your thoughts about the world

168
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,204
are you assuming the worst about others intentions

169
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:12,794
do you enter a social situation and have

170
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:15,104
already decided how it will go?

171
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:18,359
do you assume others don't want you around?

172
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,639
are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening up

173
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,384
and if so can you try to give others

174
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:28,164
the benefit of the doubt can you just assume

175
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,994
that they're not against you

176
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:33,439
can you risk being open and vulnerable again?

177
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,419
and lastly your behaviour

178
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,379
are you avoiding opportunities to be around others

179
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,779
are you looking of oppertunites to decline invitations

180
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,904
or are you pushing away others preemptively to protect yourself

181
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:50,324
are you acting as if you are getting attacked

182
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:52,719
are you really looking for new connections

183
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,364
or have you become complacent with your situation

184
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:59,564
of course every person in each situation is unique

185
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,584
and different and just in introspection alone

186
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,419
might not be enough

187
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,979
LEGAL DISCLAIMER

188
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,984
if you feel unable to solve your situation alone by yourself

189
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:10,344
please try to reach out and get professional help

190
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:14,164
its not a sign of weakness but of courage

191
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:17,094
however we look at loneliness as a purely individual

192
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:20,064
problem that needs solving to create

193
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:22,504
happiness or as a public health crisis

194
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,444
it is something that deserves more attention

195
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:28,974
humans have build a world that is nothing short of amazing

196
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:32,004
and yet not of the shiny things we have made is able to

197
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:34,304
satisfy or substitute

198
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:37,884
our fundamental and biological need for connection

199
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:40,624
most animals get what they need from their physical sourroundings

200
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,974
we get what we need from each other

201
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:46,804
and we need to build our artificial human world

202
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:49,254
based on that

203
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:53,019
(giggling)

204
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,279
lets try something together lets reach out to someone today

205
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,344
regardless if you feel a little bit lonely

206
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:03,059
or want to make someone else day better

207
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,154
maybe write a friend you haven't spoken to in a while

208
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:08,894
call a family member who has become estranged

209
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:11,484
invite a work buddy for a coffee

210
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:14,344
or just go to something you are usually to afraid to go to

211
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:17,374
or too lazy to go to like a DMD event

212
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,639
or a sports club

213
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,959
everybody is different so you know whats good for you

214
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,299
maybe nothing will come of it and that's okay

215
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,159
don't do this with any expectations

216
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,219
the goal is just to open up a bit

217
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,844
to exercise your connection muscles so that they can grow stronger over time

218
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:38,324
or to help others exercise them

219
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,484
we want to recommend two of the books we read

220
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:45,199
while researching this video

221
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,379
a book that addresses

222
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,819
among other topics

223
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,939
how to deal with loneliness in a way that we found helpful and actionable

224
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,979
and

225
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,134
loneliness, social nature and the need for social connection

226
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,934
by John T. Cacloppo & William Patrick

227
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:01,944
it's an entertaining and scientific exploration

228
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:04,904
as to why we experience loneliness on a biological

229
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:07,584
level how it's spread in society

230
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,964
and what science has to say on how to escape it

231
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:13,805
