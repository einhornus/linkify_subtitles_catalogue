1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,699
Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,859
In the process of trying to understand it, to get better at killing

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,839
it, we discovered a biological paradox

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,039
that remains unsolved to this day.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,023
Large animals seem to be immune to cancer.

6
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:19,064
Which doesn't make any sense. The bigger a being,

7
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,114
the more cancer it should have.

8
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:24,184
To understand why, we first need to take a look at

9
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:26,004
the nature of cancer itself.

10
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:33,704
[Kurzgesagt Theme]

11
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:36,444
Our cells are protein robots made out

12
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:39,324
of hundreds of millions of parts.

13
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:42,274
Guided only by chemical reactions, they create

14
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,794
and dismantle structures, sustain a

15
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,574
metabolism to gain energy, or make almost

16
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:49,634
perfect copies of themselves.

17
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:52,514
We call these complex chemical reactions pathways.

18
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:55,354
They are biochemical networks

19
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,234
upon networks, intertwined and stacked

20
00:00:58,235 --> 00:00:59,544
on top of each other.

21
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:02,014
Most of them can barely be comprehended by a

22
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:05,384
single human mind, and yet they function perfectly.

23
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:08,139
Until... they don't.

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,199
With billions

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,119
of trillions of reactions, happening in thousands of networks

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,064
over many years, the question is not if

27
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,654
something will go wrong, but when.

28
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:20,264
Tiny mistakes add up, until the grandiose

29
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:23,124
machinery gets corrupted. To prevent this from

30
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,099
getting out of hand, our cells have kill-switches that

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,494
make them commit suicide.

32
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:31,454
But these kill-switches are not infallible.

33
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:34,964
If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell.

34
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:38,614
Most of them are slain by the immune system very quickly.

35
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:41,844
But this is a numbers game. Given enough time, a cell will

36
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,434
accrue enough mistakes, slip by unnoticed, and

37
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:47,334
begin making more of itself. All

38
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:49,714
animals have to deal with this problem.

39
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:52,354
In general, the cells of different animals

40
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:55,404
are the same size. The cells of a mouse

41
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:58,704
aren't smaller than yours. It just has fewer cells in total

42
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:00,724
and a shorter lifespan.

43
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:03,224
Fewer cells and a short life means a

44
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:06,124
lower chance of things going wrong, or cells

45
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,144
mutating. Or, at least, it should mean that.

46
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,794
Humans live about fifty times longer, and have one

47
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,914
thousand times more cells than mice. Yet the rate of

48
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,424
cancer is basically the same in humans and

49
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:20,254
in mice. Even weirder, blue whales,

50
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:23,284
with about three thousand times more cells than humans

51
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:26,054
don't seem to get cancer at all, really.

52
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:28,804
This is Peto's Paradox- the baffling

53
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:31,544
realisation that large animals have much, much

54
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:34,104
less cancer than they should.

55
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:37,054
Scientists think there are two main ways of explaining

56
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:40,644
the paradox: evolution, and hypertumours.

57
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:43,604
Solution one: evolve, or become a blob

58
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,214
of cancer.

59
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:48,244
As multicellular beings developed six hundred million

60
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:51,414
years ago, animals became bigger, and bigger.

61
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:54,294
Which added more and more cells, and hence, more

62
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:57,084
and more chances that cells could be corrupted.

63
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:59,894
So, the collective had to invest in better and better

64
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:03,024
cancer defenses. The ones that did not died

65
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:06,044
out. But cancer doesn't just happen- it's a

66
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:08,784
process that involves many individual mistakes

67
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:11,424
and mutations in several specific genes

68
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,244
within the same cell.

69
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:19,364
These genes are called proto-oncogenes, and when they mutate, it's bad news.

70
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,044
For example, with the right mutation, a cell

71
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:24,699
would lose its ability to kill itself.

72
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,014
Another mutation, and it will develop the ability to hide.

73
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:31,564
Another, and it will send out calls for resources.

74
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:34,294
Another one, and it will multiply quickly.

75
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:37,184
These oncogenes have an antagonist, though.

76
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:39,684
Tumour suppressor genes.

77
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:42,264
They prevent these critical mutations from happening

78
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,294
or order the cell to kill itself

79
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,374
if they decide it's beyond repair.

80
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:50,114
It turns out that large animals have an increased number of them.

81
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:53,114
Because of this, elephant cells require more mutations

82
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:56,814
than mice cells to develop a tumour. They are not immune-

83
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,399
but more resilient. This adaption

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,664
probably comes with a cost in some form, but researchers

85
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:04,354
still aren't sure what it is.

86
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:07,014
Maybe tumour suppressors make elephants age quicker

87
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:10,594
later in life, or slow down how quickly injuries heal.

88
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,484
We don't know yet.

89
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,084
But the solution to the paradox may actually be

90
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,984
something different: hypertumours.

91
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,794
Solution two:

92
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:23,174
Hypertumours. Yes, really.

93
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:26,214
Hypertumours are named after hyperparasites: the

94
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:29,064
parasites of parasites. Hypertumours

95
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:31,234
are the tumours of tumours.

96
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:34,454
Cancer can be thought of as a breakdown in cooperation.

97
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:37,664
Normally, cells work together to form structures like

98
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,994
organs, tissue, or elements of the immune system.

99
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:43,804
But cancer cells are selfish, and only work for

100
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:46,934
their own short-term benefit. If they're successful,

101
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:49,954
they form tumours- huge cancer collectives that

102
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,064
can be very hard to kill.

103
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:55,034
Making a tumour is hard work, though.

104
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:58,064
Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly,

105
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,924
which requires a lot of resources and energy.

106
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,524
The amount of nutrients they can steal from the body

107
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:05,974
becomes the limiting factor for growth.

108
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,714
So the tumour cells trick the body to build new blood

109
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:11,324
vessels directly to the tumour, to feed

110
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,944
the thing killing it.

111
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,894
And here, the nature of cancer cells may become

112
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:17,314
their own undoing.

113
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:20,304
Cancer cells are inherently unstable, and so

114
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:23,314
they can continue to mutate- some of them faster

115
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:26,494
than their buddies. If they do this for a while,

116
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:31,024
at some point, one of the copies of the copies of the original cancer cell

117
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:34,164
might suddenly think of itself as an individual again, and

118
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:37,334
stop cooperating. Which means, just like the body,

119
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:40,294
the original tumour suddenly becomes an enemy,

120
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:43,594
fighting for the same scarce nutrients and resources.

121
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:48,134
So, the newly mutated cells can create a hypertumour.

122
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:50,744
Instead of helping, they cut off the blood supply to

123
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:53,154
their former buddies, which will starve and

124
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:55,299
kill the original cancer cells.

125
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,604
Cancer is killing cancer.

126
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:00,184
This process can repeat over and over,

127
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,804
and this may prevent cancer from becoming a problem

128
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:05,844
for a large organism. It is possible

129
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:08,674
that large have more of these hypertumours than we

130
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:11,684
realise. They might just not become big enough to notice.

131
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,979
Which makes sense. A two-gram tumour

132
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,059
is 10% of a mouse's body weight, while it's less than

133
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,199
0.002% of a human.

134
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,499
And 0.000002%

135
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,914
of a blue whale.

136
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:28,004
All three tumours require the same number of cell divisions,

137
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:31,134
and have the same number of cells. So an old blue whale

138
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:34,999
might be filled with tiny cancers, and just not care.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,234
There are other proposed solutions to Peto's Paradox,

140
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:40,884
such as different metabolic rates, or different cellular

141
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:43,719
architecture. But right now, we just don't know.

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,499
Scientists are working on the problem.

143
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,284
Figuring out how large animals are so resilient

144
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:52,214
to one of the most deadly diseases we know could open the path

145
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:55,964
to new therapies and treatments.

146
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:58,754
Cancer has always been a challenge. Today,

147
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:01,124
we are finally beginning to understand it,

148
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,364
and by doing so, one day, we might finally

149
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:07,184
overcome it.

We put a lot of time and love into

159
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,484
our merch, because just like with our videos, we only want

to put things into the world that we feel good about.

161
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,584
Kurzgesagt is a project that by right, shouldn't really work.

162
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:44,624
Videos like the one you just watched take months to finish

163
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,614
and we're only able to put in so much time because of your

164
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:50,914
direct support. Because you watch and share,

165
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,714
and because you care.

166
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:55,524
