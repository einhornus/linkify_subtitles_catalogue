1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,099
We are prisoners on Earth. The Universe taunts us, by showing all the places we can't ever visit.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,199
However, if our species wants to have a long term future, we have to escape our prison.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,899
But what is keeping us here in the first place?

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,319
Turns out, we owe the universe a debt that is 4.5 billion years old.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:36,419
*Intro*

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,139
Everything with mass in the universe attracts every other thing with mass.

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,119
We call this phenomenon 'gravity'.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,359
The closer you are to a big chunk of mass, the stronger the attraction or the more you're pulled

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,919
in.

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,519
This effect traps us on earth.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,619
We can imagine this as being prisoners in a gravity prison, or a gravity well.

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,299
It's not a literal well, but a handy concept to understand how this works.

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,439
Being in a gravity prison means that you owe gravity energy.

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,019
But how can you owe energy?

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,739
Because in our universe, things don't want to change their speed or direction.

16
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,899
To convince them to move, you have to expend energy.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,059
Billions of years ago, the gravitational attraction of trillions of trillions of dust particles

18
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,839
orbiting our sun caught them together until they formed a planet.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,519
This process used energy and created the gravity well we're now a part of.

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,459
The deeper you are inside the gravity well, the more energy you owe gravity.

21
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,779
If you don't find a way to get enough energy, then you aren't able to leave no matter what you do.

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,739
Because your atoms were once part of the dust that the universe expended energy on to get to this place.

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,859
Ok. Hmm...Let's summarise all of that again.

24
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:59,059
Objects in the universe don't like to move. You have to convince them to do so with energy.

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,999
Gravity used energy to convince the parts of our planet to move together.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,979
This created a gravity prison in the process, trapping us .

27
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,379
To escape, it we need to repay it with energy.

28
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:18,499
Ok. How do we do that?

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,959
To get into space, we need to go through a complicated process of exchanging energy.

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,399
For this purpose, we build a negative potential energy repaying machine.

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,879
Known By their more boring name 'rockets'

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,819
Rockets work by using some of the most energetic chemical reactions humans know about

33
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,559
to basically explode fuel in a controlled way.

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,379
This converts chemical energy into kinetic energy.

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,719
The exhaust of the reaction is directed outwards,

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,199
and pushes the rocket away from Earth.

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,319
By expanding a lot of energy, we are increasing our gravitational potential energy.

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,679
Which is a complicated way to say that we are paying back our energy debt to gravity.

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,679
But it's actually a lot trickier than that.

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,279
When you burn fuel to get into orbit, you lose lots of energy to heat, exhaust and atmospheric drag

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,419
,so you actually need much more.

42
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,679
And you can't just pile a huge amount of radioactive, really explosive, dangerous fuel close to your

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,159
payload and detonate it.

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,519
You need a controlled burn which is complicated and makes your rocket very heavy

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,439
...which means it has more mass.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,379
The more mass something has, the more energy you need to convince it to move,

47
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,259
so you need more fuel to lift up your rocket.

48
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,199
But,if you need more fuel, that means you need more rocket to carry that fuel!

49
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,279
But, this makes your rocket heavier thus requiring more fuel which requires more rocket to carry that

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,719
new fuel and so on.

51
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,779
At the end of this madness, you need closer to a 100x the weight of your payload to launch

52
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,819
Ariane 6, for example (the european rocket) will weigh 800 tons and should be able to

53
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:03,979
transport 10 tons into geostationary transfer orbit or, 20 tons into medium earth orbit.

54
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,539
But a rocket can only produce so much thrust, so there is a maximum weight, after which it just won't

55
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,179
take off.

56
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,499
If you add too much weight, it won't lift off. So, you can't just build bigger and bigger fuel tanks

57
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,359
This is the tyranny of the rocket equation and it means space flight will never become easy.

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,959
But wait, it gets worse.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,959
Getting to space is still not good enough- you're still inside the gravity prison at the edge of space and

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,999
will crash back to Earth.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,579
Staying in space is much harder than getting there.

62
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,219
To get to a stable position, where it can stay for  a while, a rocket has to reach low Earth orbit.

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,039
To do this, you need a lot of kinetic energy which means going extremely fast

64
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,679
at an altitude of about 100 km, this is 8 km/s

65
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,999
28,000 km/h is fast enough to travel around Earth in 90 minutes.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,599
Here, we can use a trick.

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,739
Instead of flying straight up, we can go sideways!

68
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,459
Earth is a sphere.

69
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,039
So, if you're going sideways, fast enough (even though you're falling towards Earth) the ground will curve

70
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,879
away beneath you.

71
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,499
So, as long as you're above the atmosphere (about 100 km up) you'll be able to stay up there in orbit.

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,579
This is what the ISS does (falling around Earth, expending energy form time to time) to stay

73
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,019
fast enough.

74
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,779
If we look at orbits in scale, we see that near Earth orbit is laughably close to Earth.

75
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:40,459
To deploy, for eg Satellites, on leave for other planets, requires another round of energy debt repayment.

76
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,019
Getting to orbit is the most difficult part of space flight for us right now.

77
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:51,039
For example: If we want to send a rocket to Mars, half the energy is necessary just to get into orbit

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,199
and the other half for the 55 million km to Mars.

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,099
Therefore, to be as effective as possible, rockets aren't built in one giant piece.

80
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:06,359
Instead, we use multistage rockets. We don't need to carry an empty fuel tank, so rockets drop it.

81
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,839
Rockets today, shed their boosters and main stage as they ascend with each successive stage being it's own

82
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,259
fully contained rocket, complete with its own engine and fuel.

83
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,059
Ok. So this is why getting to space is hard.

84
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:30,399
If you feel all of this seems really complicated, don't worry. It's literally rocket science!

85
