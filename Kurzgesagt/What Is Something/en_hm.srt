1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,599
The simple questions are the hardest ones to answer.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,859
What is a thing?

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,659
Why do things happen?

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,379
And why DO they happen the way they do?

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,699
Let's try to approach this step by step.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,599
What are you made of?

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,999
You are matter,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,519
which is made of molecules,

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,659
which are made of atoms,

10
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,499
and those are made of elementary particles.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,739
But, if elementary particles are the smallest things that exist,

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:35,199
What are THEY made of?

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,379
To answer a simple question, let's start simply.

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,679
Let's wipe the universe clean.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,379
Away with matter, antimatter, radiation, particles, anything.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,139
Now let's take a closer look at absolutely nothing.

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,179
What is empty space?

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,179
Is it what we call a vacuum?

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,239
There are no atoms, no matter, nothing!

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,459
Is it really all that empty?

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,099
Nothing gives us the building blocks for everything.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,379
In a sense, empty space is a lot like a vast, calm ocean.

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,239
While the water is very still when nothing is happening,

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,539
a stiff breeze can create some serious waves.

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,659
Our universe works a lot like this.

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,879
There are these oceans everywhere.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,419
Physicists call them fields.

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,999
This might be strange and new,

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,559
but think about radiation for example.

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,139
By exciting what's known as the electromagnetic field, a little kink is created

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,239
which is the particle we call the photon.

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,139
The particle that carries radiation, we perceive it as light.

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,919
This isn't unique to light; every particle in the universe is made this way.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,459
There are fields for every particle of matter all with their own rules.

35
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,619
For example, along with the electromagnetic field, there is an electron field everywhere in the universe

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,699
and little kinks in that field are electrons.

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,359
All together, the fields of our universe can produce 17 particles which can be divided into 3 categories.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,119
The leptons, and the quarks, and the bosons.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,419
Leptons consist of the electron as well as its cousins: muon and tau particles.

40
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,999
Each has an associated neutrino.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,779
Then, there are quarks.

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,539
The quarks are the nuclear family of particles.

43
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,599
They're always found bound together in groups and pairs

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,359
and make up protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,619
Together, the leptons and quarks are the matter particles.

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,519
They make up all the things you see.

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,979
The air you breathe, the sun that warms you,

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,259
the computer you're using right now to distract yourself from the stuff you should be doing.

49
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,719
But things don't just exist, they also do stuff.

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,939
In some philosophical sense, the properties of a thing are just as much a part of it as existence itself.

51
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,719
This is where the bosons and the fields that makes them come in to play.

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,679
While the quarks and leptons are made by the matter fields,

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,479
the bosons are made by force fields.

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,199
We call a rule of the universe a force.

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,679
And so far, 4 fundamental forces have been discovered:

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,639
Electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.

57
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,439
These forces are the rule book of a game where the pieces are the particles, and the game is the universe.

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,099
They tell particles what they can do and how they can do it.

59
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,839
Bishops move diagonally,

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,299
massless particles move at the speed of light,

61
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,719
knights can jump,

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,479
gravity attracts.

63
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,619
The forces are the rules for how particles interact

64
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,479
Which ultimately make them the rules for how particles assemble into all the big things we see in the universe.

65
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,439
Gravity isn't just the rule for orbits around the sun or apples falling from trees.

66
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,239
As a rule, it says matter attracts, which builds planets and stars.

67
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,639
Electromagnetism isn't just the rule for magnets attracting or repelling, or electric currents in light bulbs.

68
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,939
It governs all atomic bonds, building every molecule.

69
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,199
Together, forces and particles are sort of like the Tinkertoys of existence.

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,099
The bosons are like messengers. Passed between, you could say, connecting the matter particles.

71
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,799
Which they use to tell each other how to move.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,619
Each particle uses a certain set of the forces to interact with other particles.

73
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,539
Quarks, for example, can interact with each other with electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force,

74
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,679
but electrons don't use the strong force, just electromagnetism.

75
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,879
The quarks exchange strong force bosons, communicating the strong nuclear attraction to each other,

76
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,599
while the protons they build exchange the particles of electromagnetism, photons with the electrons.

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,339
Thus, the quarks end up locked up in nuclei,

78
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,099
while the electrons remain attached by their electric attraction, building atoms.

79
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,679
Even though the universe has lots of big, messy phenomena like life, supernova, and computers,

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,579
that seem complex on the surface.

81
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,139
If you zoom in far enough on anything, you just get 17 particles emerging from underlying fields,

82
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,299
playing a game with 4 rules.

83
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,779
To summarize, in the most basic form we know right now, this is what things are.

84
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,919
This theory is what physicists call the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,319
You are basically nothing more than disturbances

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,459
on an ocean that's excited by energy and guided by forces that make up the rules of the universe.

87
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,939
But why? And what is a force?

88
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,479
We'll have to explore a few more simple questions to get to the bottom of this.

89
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,259
We made some wallpapers from some of the graphics in this video: You can get them on patreon.com
