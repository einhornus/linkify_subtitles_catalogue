1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:07,519
Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, 
even in this one. Because our videos distill  

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,679
very complex subjects into flashy ten minute 
pieces and unfortunately, reality is, well,  

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,279
complicated. The question 
of how we deal with that,  

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:30,879
is central to what we do on this channel 
and something we think about a lot.

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,279
What we mean by lying is the 
concept of “lies to children”.  

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,479
The idea that on the path to explaining something 
complicated you start off with a little lie,  

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,239
a useful oversimplification, that makes it 
easier to grasp a concept. For example as a  

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,519
kid you learn that the earth is a sphere orbiting 
the sun with planet buddies. But it's not actually  

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,959
a sphere and the buddies are super different 
in size and not close to each other at all.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,279
By beginning at a place of oversimplification 
you are building a framework,  

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,599
a foundation that you can then build upon 
and add nuance and complexity later on.  

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,639
Step by step you are getting towards the 
real gist of the complicated subject.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,479
Science communication has to use 
“lies to children” to some degree  

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,479
or it turns into science education. And getting a 
proper education in all of the scientific fields  

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,239
would take years of intense 
study to become fluent in them.

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,959
As a species we have a major interest in 
summarizing science and its advancements  

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,119
and educating as many people about it as 
possible, because we all benefit if more  

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,279
people have a fact based, scientific world view. 
We will discuss what science is and how it works  

19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,319
in different videos in more detail, but for 
now let's just say it's a process to advance,  

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,879
organize, predict and test our 
knowledge about the universe.

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,839
If you understand the current 
state of scientific knowledge  

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,999
then you can make better decisions, 
based on facts and testable ideas  

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,479
rather than outdated belief systems or 
our intuition that evolved to protect  

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,239
our ancestors from lions but is no longer 
suited for the complexity of our modern world.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,039
Our brains are comically ill prepared to 
navigate the fast moving world we happen  

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,759
to live in today – a world ironically created by 
science. A few hundred years ago it was possible  

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,639
to be knowledgeable at an expert level in 
pretty much every field of study. In the  

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,039
information age this is a futile endeavor since 
knowledge and data are increasing exponentially.

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,399
So to even have a chance of grasping the world we 
live in we need summaries that give us, if not a  

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,079
true understanding of all the details, a solid 
overview. Explaining science to many people is  

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,999
not about enlightening the ignorant but necessary 
for the progress of our species at large.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,759
To make this possible we need to find 
metaphors and stories that capture the  

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,519
true nature of things as much as possible while 
using a language that our brains can deal with.

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,159
A great example here is physics.
Quarks are often depicted as blue,  

35
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,919
red and green, with different spins. But just 
saying spin and using colors forces our brain  

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,439
to imagine colorful spinning balls. Which is 
great to visualize the different types and the  

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,359
relationships between quarks, but also creates 
a very wrong image of reality in our heads.

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,119
Molecules are nothing like the neat 
diagrams that we're taught in school  

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,839
but buzzing and vibrating entities held 
together by something we call “charge” that  

40
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,279
describes how certain things want to be close 
or escape each other for some unknown reason.  

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,079
We are describing phenomena that we are pretty 
sure exist in some form or another because the math  

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,679
works out and we can do real world experiments 
and predict their results before we do them.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,839
In reality these are models, 
tricks to summarize what we know  

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,279
and make up a coherent story and prepare 
the ground for more in depth explanations.  

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,839
Don’t confuse the description 
of a thing for the thing itself.

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,119
Simplifications like these are 
not just meant to dumb things down  

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,719
they are actually useful for 
experts themselves. For example  

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,879
chemists who use “wrong” electron shell models 
to work out chemical bonds or scientists using  

49
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,039
simplified models as the basis of discussions with 
colleagues across different scientific fields.

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,919
But the simplification of science can also 
be problematic for a bunch of reasons.

51
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,839
Finding the true nature of reality is 
super hard because our brains did not  

52
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,159
evolve for this job and the universe 
does not care if we understand it.  

53
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,319
Science is a process to work towards gaining 
knowledge and not an absolute truth generator.  

54
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,079
The answers it provides are multi-layered and 
nuanced and that complexity can get lost when  

55
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,759
it is simplified. Especially when it is done 
so for headlines. An interesting cancer study  

56
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,999
turns into a potential cure, a healthy 
food becomes the basis for a new diet.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,199
Such simplifications give a misleading 
definiteness to science which goes against its  

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,519
process-like nature. When cures don't materialize 
and diets don't turn out to be magical,  

59
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,839
we lose confidence in science and start to think 
of all science communication as misleading.

60
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,919
Then there is the opposite effect:  

61
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,919
If a simplification is too engaging, if the story 
it tells is too good, it can distort the true  

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,839
complexity of a subject and give you a false sense 
of security and an illusion of deep knowledge.  

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,079
A gut feeling that you understand the science 
better than you actually do, which can lead  

64
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,839
people to ignore actual experts over their 
dangerous superficial knowledge and gut feeling.

65
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,599
And this can have negative consequences for all 
of us because in the worst case overconfidence  

66
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,679
in your own understanding of science can 
lead to bad decisions made with confidence.  

67
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,239
Just think of the surge of people that 
confidently disavow vaccines or climate change  

68
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,759
without truly understanding the subject matter.

69
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,079
So considering all of this and the fact that we  

70
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,519
at Kurzgesagt reach millions of people 
with our videos, how do we handle this?

71
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,799
Well, it has been a journey, especially the 
research. When we started we just read articles,  

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,559
then moved on to books, peer reviewed papers, then 
to conversations with experts. We began to collect  

73
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,639
our sources. With every step we realised that we 
were still not doing enough. Nowadays we try to  

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,479
read as many primary sources as possible, talk to 
multiple experts and document our simplifications  

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,159
and give further reading in our sources doc. 
But this doesn’t make our process flawless.

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,359
What do you do if experts disagree with each 
other? What do you do if you find an amazing fact  

77
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,559
that perfectly fits a narrative but just can’t 
find its primary source? How do you deal with  

78
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,479
the reality that many scientific results have 
huge error bars or “maybes” attached to them?  

79
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,199
How do you handle complex 
systems that defy easy answers?

80
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,319
In the end, we make ten minute videos, so we 
need to make decisions about what details and  

81
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,239
explanations can fit, which aspects need to be 
simplified and which parts to cut.There is no  

82
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,519
single best answer for how to do this and so we 
weigh the different options every single time.

83
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,119
It can be painful for experts 
to see their field simplified.  

84
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,919
Some are happy with us, while others don't like 
it. This is fair but also impossible to avoid.  

85
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,719
We are still trying to improve and want to be 
transparent about what we are trying to do.  

86
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,559
For example we are taking part in the TRESCA 
project about science communication to learn more.

87
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
All of this brings us to 
the purpose of our videos.  

88
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,999
The most important thing we want to do with this 
channel is to inspire you and spark your curiosity  

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,759
for science and the amazing universe we live in. 
Learning often doesn’t feel like fun, but with the  

90
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,999
right story, it is one of the best things and 
we hope to provide that to you. Ultimately we  

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,399
hope that we light a fire in you that motivates 
you to read books, pay more attention at school  

92
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,439
or university and just get interested in a 
scientific field or two and learn more on your  

93
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,039
own. Not because you have to, but because you want 
to know more about how the world really works.  

94
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,959
Because the universe is beautiful and science 
is a way of seeing this beauty more clearly.

95
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,039
And we hope that knowing that we have to simplify 
a bit does not make you enjoy our videos less.

96
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,439
We are trying to build something with 
Kurzgesagt and while we are not 100%  

97
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,319
sure yet what exactly, hopefully something that 
gets people to think about their own life and the  

98
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,239
context they exist in today, as well as the far 
future and the potential we all have as a species.  

99
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,558
And of course how big things are and what happens 
when we blow stuff up, because it is fun. Thanks  

100
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,639
for watching and sharing and supporting 
us – we really can’t do this without you.

101
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,439
Running a science communication business 
is a balancing act that we take extremely  

102
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,999
seriously. On the one hand we need to 
be responsible and look out for the team  

103
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,919
and be able to grow responsibly on the other hand 
we have to protect the integrity of our videos.  

104
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,159
You are enabling us to stay independent 
because while we do things like sponsorships  

105
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,319
or commercial work, the majority of 
our income comes directly from you,  

106
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,799
the birbs. Kurzgesagt is fundamentally 
funded by its community. By you. Because  

107
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,479
of you Kurzgesagt is able to invest as much 
time in our videos and try to become better.

108
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,759
You get our calendar every year, support us on 
Patreon and get your personal birds, watch our  

109
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,119
videos without adblock or with Youtube premium 
.Our favorite way to keep the channel running are  

110
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,559
our sciency products from our shop that hopefully 
add additional value to the world. We love  

111
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,359
bringing little pieces of knowledge into your home 
or classroom that inspire you to learn more about  

112
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,199
the universe in a little more detail. Especially 
with our carefully researched infographic posters.  

113
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,399
Our latest one teaches you about the night sky and  

114
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,319
showcases the stars in our night sky and 
their special significance for humanity.

115
