[Music]

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,339
A war has been raging for billions of years,

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,699
killing trillions every single day, while we don't even notice.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,779
The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet:

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,539
the bacteriophage

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,189
or 'phage' for short.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:26,399
[Intro + Music]

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,819
A phage is a virus;

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,219
not quite alive,

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,779
not quite dead.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,619
Also, they look as if someone made them up.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,839
Their head is an icosahedron,

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,379
a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,059
It contains the genetic material of the virus

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,738
and often sits on a long tail that has leg-like fibers.

16
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,499
There are more phages on earth than every other organism combined,

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,119
including bacteria.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,239
And they are probably everywhere living things exist.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,639
Billions are on your hands, in your intestines and your eyelids right now.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,859
Which might make you nervous since phages are responsible for the majority of deaths on earth

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,039
but you're lucky.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,559
While they do commit genocide for breakfast,

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,879
they only kill bacteria.

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,079
Up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans are killed by them every single day.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,799
But phages also have major flaws.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,259
Like any other virus, phages need a host to survive and reproduce.

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,219
They're not much more than genetic material in a hull

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,199
and they specialize.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,799
Usually, a phage has chosen one specific bacteria

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,868
and maybe some of its very close relatives.

31
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:43,199
These are its prey.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,959
Imagine a phage as like a cruise missile that only hunts and kills members of one very unlucky family.

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,879
When a phage finds its victim,

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,059
it connects its tail fibers with receptors and uses a sort of syringe to puncture a surface.

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,939
In a weird motion, the phage squeezes its tail and injects its genetic information.

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,319
Within minutes, the bacteria is taken over.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,499
It's now forced to manufacture all the parts of new phages.

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,559
They only stop when the bacteria is filled up with brand-new phages.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,829
In the final step,

40
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,659
they produce 'endolysin',

41
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,359
a powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,899
The pressure is so high that the bacteria sort of vomits out all of its insides and dies.

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,259
New phages are released and begin the cycle anew.

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,659
In the last few years,

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,299
bacteriophages have enjoyed the attention of the second deadliest beings on earth:

46
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,039
humans.

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,419
Recently, we've started looking into injecting millions of them into our bodies

48
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,719
because we're sort of getting desperate;

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,319
we screwed up.

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,939
In the past a single cut or a sip from the wrong puddle could kill you.

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,699
Bacteria were our phages.

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,559
Tiny monsters that hunted us mercilessly.

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,819
But then, about 100 years ago, we found a solution in nature.

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,459
By accident, we found fungi that produced compounds that killed bacteria:

55
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,059
antibiotics.

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,759
Suddenly, we had a powerful super weapon.

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,139
Antibiotics were so effective that we stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters.

58
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,149
Only the old and the weakest among us were killed by them.

59
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,309
We used antibiotics more and more for less and less serious causes.

60
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,149
We lost respect for the monsters and the weapon

61
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:37,379
But bacteria are living things that evolve and one by one they started to become immune against our weapons.

62
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,079
This continued until we had created what are called 'superbugs',

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,779
bacteria immune to almost everything we have.

64
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,779
This immunity is spreading across the world as we speak.

65
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,779
By 2050, superbugs could kill more humans a year than cancer.

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,319
The days when a cut or bladder infection or a cough could kill you or your loved ones are coming back.

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,839
In the US alone, more than 23,000 people die from resistant bacteria each year.

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,699
But it turns out that phages, our tiny killer virus robots, could save us.

69
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,739
We can inject them into our bodies to help cure infections.

70
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:24,439
Hold on, how could injecting millions of viruses into an infection be a good idea?

71
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,119
Phages are very very specialized killers of bacteria.

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,359
So specialized, in fact, that humans are completely immune to them;

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,279
we are too different.

74
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,419
We encounter billions of phages every day and we just politely ignore each other.

75
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:48,439
Antibiotics are like carpet bombing, killing everything even the good bacteria in our intestines that we don't want to harm

76
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,259
Phages are like guided missiles that only attack what they're supposed to

77
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,859
Wait a minute, if we use phages to kill bacteria, won't bacteria develop ways of defending themselves?

78
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,559
Well, it's more complex than that; phages evolved too.

79
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,819
There has been an arms race between them and bacteria for billions of years and so far, they're doing great.

80
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:19,659
This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly getting better at killing.

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,039
But even if bacteria were to become immune against our phage, we still might be able to win.

82
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,419
It turns out that in order to become resistant to even just a few species of phages,

83
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,899
bacteria have to give up their resistance to antibiotics.

84
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,439
We might be able to trap them in a catch-22.

85
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,699
This has already been successfully tested with a patient who had no other hope left

86
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:53,319
The bacteria 'Pseudomonas Aeruginosa', one of the most feared bacteria, infected the man's chest cavity.

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,299
They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics

88
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,699
and can even survive an alcoholic hand gel.

89
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,319
After years of suffering, a few thousand phages were directly inserted into his chest cavity

90
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,839
together with antibiotics the bacteria were immune to.

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,319
After a few weeks, the infections had completely disappeared.

92
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:20,319
Unfortunately, this treatment is still experimental and pharma companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary billions

93
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,679
in a treatment that has no official approval yet.

94
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,699
But things are finally changing.

95
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,019
In 2016, the largest phage clinical trial to date began and phages are getting more and more attention.

96
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:42,319
and we better get used to it because the era in which antibiotics have been our super weapon is drawing to a close.

97
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,649
It might be a weird concept but injecting the deadliest being on planet Earth

98
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,979
directly into our bodies could save millions of lives
