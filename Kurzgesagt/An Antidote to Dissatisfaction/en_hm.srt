1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,439
Everybody is familiar with the feeling that things are not as they should be.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,044
That you're not successful enough.

3
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:10,294
Your relationships not satisfying enough.

4
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:13,379
That you don't have the things you crave.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,299
A chronic dissatisfaction that makes you look outwards with envy

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,699
and inwards with disappointment.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,339
Pop culture, advertising and social media made this worse

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,239
by reminding you that aiming for anything less than your dream job is failure,

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,899
you need to have great experiences constantly,

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,359
be conventionally attractive, have a lot of friends,

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,339
and find your soulmate, and that others have all of these things,

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,459
and are truly happy.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,664
And of course, a vast array of self-improvement products

14
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:46,499
implies that it's all your fault for not working hard enough on yourself.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,499
In the last two decades, researchers have been starting to

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,239
investigate how we can counteract these impulses.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,779
The field of positive psychology emerged.

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,899
The study of what makes life worth living.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,199
While cognitive behaviorial therapy was developed to change negative feelings.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,999
Scientists began to ask why are some people happier and more satisfied than others,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,559
and are there ways to apply what they're doing right, to the rest of us.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,819
In this video, we want to talk about one of the strongest predictors of

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,279
how happy people are,

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,639
how easily they make friends,

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,519
and how good they are at dealing with hardship.

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,359
An antidote to dissatisfaction so to speak.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,719
Gratitude.

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,319
While gratitude may sound like another self-improvement trend

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,739
preached by people who use #hashtags,

30
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,539
what we currently know about it is based on a body of scientific work and studies.

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,499
We'll include them in the description.

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,859
Gratitude can mean very different things to different people in different contexts.

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,174
It's a character trait, a feeling, a virtue

34
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,879
and a behaviour.

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,099
You can feel grateful towards someone who did something for you,

36
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,079
for random events like the weather, or even for nature.

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,519
Or fate.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,164
And it's wired into our biology.

39
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:02,604
How gratitude connects us to each other.

40
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,494
The predecessor of gratitude

41
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:06,774
is probably reciprocity.

42
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:09,844
It likely evolved as a biological signal

43
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:13,104
that motivates animals to exchange things for their mutual benefit

44
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:16,099
and can be found in the animal kingdom among certain fish,

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,819
birds, or mammals,

46
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,819
but especially in primates.

47
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,019
When your brain recognises that someone's done something nice for you

48
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,279
it reacts with gratitude to motivate you to repay them.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,879
This gratitude makes you care about others,

50
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,019
and others care about you.

51
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,359
This was important because as human brains got better at reading emotions,

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,154
selfish individuals were identified and shunned.

53
00:02:40,155 --> 00:02:43,244
It became an evolutionary advantage to play well with others,

54
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:46,339
and build lasting relationships.

55
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,339
For example, if you were hungry and someone else showed you

56
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,939
where to find tasty berries,

57
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,679
you felt gratitude towards them and a bond to return the favour in the future.

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,099
A drive to be pro-social.

59
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,059
When you repaid them, they felt gratitude towards you.

60
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,079
This brought your ancestors close together,

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,319
and forged bonds and friendships.

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,619
So early forms of gratitude were biological mechanisms

63
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,659
that modified your behaviour towards cooperation

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,459
which helped humans to dominate Earth.

65
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,594
But over time, gratitude became more than just

66
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:22,299
an impulse to play fair.

67
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,179
The consequences of gratitude.

68
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,139
Scientists found that gratitude stimulates the pathways

69
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,759
in your brain involved in feelings of reward,

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,719
forming social bonds,

71
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,419
and interpreting others' intentions.

72
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,479
It also makes it easier to save and retrieve positive memories.

73
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,639
Even more,

74
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,354
gratitude directly counteracts negative feelings

75
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:47,424
in traits like envy and social comparison,

76
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:51,359
narcissism, cynicism and materialism.

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,839
As a consequence, people who are grateful no matter what for

78
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,579
tend to be happier and more satisfied.

79
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,199
They have better relationships,

80
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,279
an easier time making friends.

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,159
They sleep better,

82
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,519
tend to suffer less from depression,

83
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,999
addiction, and burnout

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,959
and are better at dealing with traumatic events.

85
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,954
In a way, gratitude makes it less likely that you'll fall

86
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:18,124
into one of the psychological traps modern life has set for you.

87
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,199
For example, gratitude measurably counters the tendency to

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,279
forget, and downplay positive events.

89
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,539
If you work long and hard for something,

90
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,579
actually getting it can feel daft and empty.

91
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,519
You can find yourself emotionally back where you started

92
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,079
and try to achieve the next biggest thing

93
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,339
looking for that satisfaction instead of being satisfied with yourself.

94
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,579
Or imagine being lonely and wanting to have more friends.

95
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,599
You actually might have someone or even multiple people

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,039
who want to hang out.

97
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,239
But you might feel that this is not enough,

98
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,799
that you're a loser, and you feel bad about yourself.

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,319
so you might turn down their attempts to hang out

100
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,959
and become more lonely.

101
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,879
If you feel grateful for your relationships instead,

102
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,179
you might accept invitations, or even take the initiative.

103
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,319
The more often you risk opening up,

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,959
the higher the chance of solidifying relationships

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,499
and meeting new people.

106
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,899
In the best case,

107
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,399
gratitude can trigger a feedback loop.

108
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,959
Positive feelings lead to more pro-social behaviour,

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,774
which leads to more positive social experiences,

110
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,454
that cause more positive feelings.

111
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:23,474
This is a common experience after serious hardship

112
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:25,534
like chemotherapy for example.

113
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:28,664
Life can feel amazing after a crisis is over.

114
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:31,739
The smallest things can be bottomless sources of joy.

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,664
from being able to taste, to just sitting in the sun

116
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,739
or chatting with a friend.

117
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,879
Objectively, your life is the same or

118
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,019
may be even slightly worse than before,

119
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,019
but your brain compares your present experiences

120
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,959
with the times when life was bad,

121
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,759
and reacts with gratitude.

122
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,439
So, in a nutshell

123
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,339
gratitude refocuses your attention towards

124
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,359
the good things you have.

125
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,339
And the consequences of this shift,

126
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,479
are better feelings,

127
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,279
and more positive experiences.

128
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,179
While it is great to know these things,

129
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,719
is there actually a way for you to feel more of it?

130
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,254
How to make your brain more grateful.

131
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:13,424
The ability to experience more or less gratitude

132
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:16,004
is not equally distributed.

133
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,094
you have what's known as 'trait gratitude'.

134
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:22,319
That determines how much you are able to feel it.

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,099
It depends on your genetics,

136
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,779
personality and culture.

137
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,159
This discovery made scientists wonder if they could

138
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,419
design exercises that change your trait gratitude,

139
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,959
and lead to more happiness.

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,899
Let's start with important caveats.

141
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,619
It's not yet entirely clear to what degree gratitude can be trained,

142
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,839
or how long the effects last.

143
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,999
There are no magic pills for happiness.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,479
Life is complicated.

145
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,459
On some days it feels like you're in control of yourself,

146
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,159
and on others, you feel like you're not.

147
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,159
and this is okay.

148
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,439
Also, sometimes pursuing happiness can make you more unhappy

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,499
if you put too much pressure on yourself.

150
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,419
Gratitude should also not be seen as a solution to

151
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,659
depression, or a substitute for professional help.

152
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,599
It can only be a piece of the puzzle.

153
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,019
It's not the solution to the puzzle itself.

154
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,979
The easiest gratitude exercise with the most solid research behind it

155
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,819
Is gratitude journaling.

156
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,019
It means, sitting down for a few minutes,

157
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,099
one to three times a week, and writing down

158
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,719
five to ten things you're grateful for.

159
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,739
It might feel weird at first.

160
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,879
So start simply.

161
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,039
Can you feel grateful for a little thing?

162
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,679
Like how great coffee is,

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,479
or that someone was kind to you?

164
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,739
Can you appreciate something someone else did feel?

165
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,959
Can you reflect on which things or people

166
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,199
you would miss if they were gone,

167
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,899
and be grateful that they're in your life?

168
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,139
We're all different,

169
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,859
so you'll know what works for you.

170
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,039
And that's it really.

171
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,559
It feels almost insulting.

172
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,239
Like, things shouldn't be that simple.

173
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,579
But in numerous studies,

174
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,579
the participants reported more happiness

175
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,779
and a higher general life satisfaction

176
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,759
after doing this practice for a few weeks.

177
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,719
And even more,

178
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,159
studies have found changes in brain activity

179
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,519
some months after they ended.

180
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,899
Practicing gratitude may be a real way to

181
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,979
reprogram yourself.

182
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,159
This research shows that your emotions

183
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,379
are not fixed.

184
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,179
In the end, how you experience life

185
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,219
is a representation of what you believe about it.

186
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,659
If you attack your core beliefs about

187
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,739
yourself and your life,

188
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,679
You can change your thoughts and feelings

189
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,499
which automatically changes your behaviour.

190
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,679
It's pretty mindblowing that something as simple as

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,939
self reflection can hack the pathways in our brain

192
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,399
to fight dissatisfaction.

193
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,279
And, if this is no reason to be more optimistic,

194
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,979
what is?

195
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,579
Being a human is hard.

196
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,679
but it doesn't need to be as hard.

197
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,539
And if you actively look,

198
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,119
you might find that your life is much better

199
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,519
than you thought.

200
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,959
*Woof!*

201
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,579
*Bwoooh!*

202
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,319
If you're curious and want to try out gratitude,

203
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,419
we made a thing.

204
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,939
Please note that you don't need to buy anything

205
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,039
from anyone to practice gratitude,

206
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,959
all you need is paper,

207
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,519
a pen,

208
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,019
and five minutes.

209
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,979
Having said that,

210
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,579
we've made a Kurzegesagt Gratitude Journal.

211
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,379
Based on studies we've read,

212
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,799
conversations with experts,

213
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,159
and our personal experiences with gratitude over the last year.

214
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,079
It's structured in a way

215
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,859
that might make it a bit easier to

216
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,759
get into the habit of gratitude journaling.

217
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,659
There are short explanations and reflections

218
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,819
to mix it up,

219
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,599
and make it more interesting.

220
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,959
We've also made it as pretty as we could.

221
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,359
The video continues the unofficial series of

222
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,779
more personal, introspective videos

223
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,659
from optimistic nihilism to loneliness,

224
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,559
and now, gratitude.

225
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,459
We don't want to be a self-help channel,

226
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,739
so we'll keep this sort of video at roughly one per year.

227
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,234
We hope they're helpful to some of you.

228
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:50,384
Thank you for watching.

229
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:51,645
*Quack!*
