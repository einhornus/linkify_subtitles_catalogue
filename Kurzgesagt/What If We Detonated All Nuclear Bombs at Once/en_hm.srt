1
00:00:01,842 --> 00:00:05,612
Many of our viewers have asked us
a very serious question:

2
00:00:05,613 --> 00:00:07,480
What if we made a big pile of bombs

3
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:11,151
and exploded every nuclear weapon
in the world all at once?

4
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:13,553
Strangely enough, we couldn't find a good source

5
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:16,055
to answer this question to our satisfaction.

6
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:20,060
So, we gathered together a few scientists
to calculate what would happen.

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,997
And find an answer to this extremely
important scientific problem,

8
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:25,498
once and for all.

9
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:29,235
Currently, there are 15,000 nuclear weapons on Earth.

10
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:31,871
The US and Russia both have around 7,000,

11
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:35,842
while France, China, the UK,
Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea

12
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:38,211
own around 1,000 between them.

13
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:41,481
But, how much destructive power is this really?

14
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:53,426
Let's try to put these numbers into perspective.

15
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:57,464
On Earth, there are about 4,500 cities or urban areas

16
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:00,000
with at least 100,000 inhabitants.

17
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,069
Some are bigger than others,
so we'll assume that on average,

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,706
we need three nuclear bombs to completely wipe out one city.

19
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:10,176
This means we could destroy
every single city on planet Earth,

20
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:11,444
with our nuclear arsenal,

21
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:14,781
killing more than three billion people
-- roughly half of humanity

22
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:15,849
in an instant.

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,586
And, we'd still have 1,500 nuclear weapons left.

24
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:22,555
Now that's what an expert would call, "overkill."

25
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:25,759
So, we can say with confidence,
that we have a lot of nuclear weapons

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,761
and they can do a lot of damage.

27
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:32,432
But, what if we make a huge pile
of all 15,000 bombs and pull the trigger?

28
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,602
Let's drop our nuclear pile in the middle of the Amazon rainforest;

29
00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:37,604
just a show nature who's boss.

30
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:41,641
Our warheads, piled haphazardly,
fit into a small warehouse.

31
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:46,479
A typical US warhead has the power
of two hundred thousand tons of TNT.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,918
So, fifteen thousand warheads would be
the equivalent of three billion tons of TNT.

33
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:55,255
For scale, this is enough
to rebuild the whole island of Manhattan

34
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:59,025
with every building and skyscraper using stacks of TNT.

35
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:03,430
The closest thing we can compare
to the energy gathered here, is a volcano.

36
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:07,934
One of the deadliest volcanic eruptions
in recorded history took place in 1883,

37
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:09,835
on the island of Krakatoa.

38
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:13,339
The eruption was so powerful, that 70% of the island,

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,408
and the surrounding archipelago, was destroyed

40
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,577
killing tens of thousands of people.

41
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:21,714
Its effects were felt around
the world for days after the event.

42
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:27,120
Our nuclear pile contains 15 times
the energy of the Krakatoa volcanic eruption.

43
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,622
So, let's finally push the button.

44
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:30,824
Three,

45
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:31,958
two,

46
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,693
one.

47
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:34,561
In a second,

48
00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:38,264
a fireball 50 kilometers across
vaporizes everything in its way,

49
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:43,002
and creates a blast wave that flattens
3,000 square kilometers of forest.

50
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:47,273
Every living thing within
250 kilometers will start to burn.

51
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:50,176
The explosion will be heard literally around the world,

52
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:54,481
as the pressure wave circles the Earth
tens of times over the next few weeks.

53
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:59,119
Millions of tons of incinerated material
are catapulted into the atmosphere.

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,188
The mushroom cloud reaches
the outer reaches of the stratosphere,

55
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,557
pushing up against space itself.

56
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,126
After things have calmed down,

57
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:08,461
a small crater -- about ten kilometers across

58
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:12,198
is left in the center of the worst
world fires the planet has seen in millennia,

59
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,769
spreading throughout South America,
burning down forests and cities alike.

60
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,239
And, now, the unpleasant part begins.

61
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,976
Extremely radioactive material
will kill living things very quickly,

62
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:26,546
and a large area several kilometers
around the crater is now uninhabitable,

63
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:29,916
as is everywhere for hundreds of kilometers downwind.

64
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:33,553
Much of the fallout is carried high
into the atmosphere by the mushroom cloud

65
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:35,722
and carried around the planet.

66
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:39,659
The amount of radioactive material
in the environment doubles worldwide,

67
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,330
which still isn't civilization-ending,
but we may see more cancer for a while.

68
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:47,467
A portion of the particles will flow
to the edge of space for years

69
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:49,002
and cause a nuclear winter

70
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:53,273
that could lower global temperatures
by a few degrees for a few years.

71
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:57,844
This explosion was pretty bad if
you're in South America, and especially Brazil.

72
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:01,481
The Amazon rainforest is pretty much history, which is not great.

73
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,917
But, human life will go on.

74
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:07,420
OK, but what if we explode more nuclear weapons?

75
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:11,457
Let's suppose humanity decided
to mine every bit of uranium on Earth

76
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,561
and build as many nuclear bombs as possible.

77
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,695
At current usage,

78
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:20,633
it's estimated that there are around
35 million tons of uranium in Earth's crust;

79
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:24,304
enough to power human civilization for over 2,000 years,

80
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,173
or to build millions of nuclear warheads.

81
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:28,308
For the sake of argument,

82
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,945
let's say we create a pile
with the yield of 10 billion Hiroshima bombs,

83
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:35,848
which makes up a cube three kilometers high
that contains roughly the energy

84
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:40,587
of the asteroid impact that ended
the age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

85
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:43,289
Except, it's also nuclear.

86
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,490
Three,

87
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,692
two,

88
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,393
one.

89
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:51,464
Our pile explodes in a fireball
stretching so high into the sky

90
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,866
that it's visible from half of South America,

91
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:57,470
with so much power that
the ground just splashes like water

92
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,540
forming a crater 100 kilometers across.

93
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:04,611
Bedrock on the scale of whole mountain ranges
is vaporized in an instant,

94
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:08,281
while thousands of tons of material
is catapulted away with such speed,

95
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:10,116
that it's ejected into space.

96
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:11,718
Some leaves Earth forever,

97
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:15,054
while most of it comes raining down
as hot, burning debris

98
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,724
that heats up the atmosphere
to oven-like temperatures,

99
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:22,295
killing most big animals
and causing fire storms all over the world.

100
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:24,530
The Earth's crust rings like a bell

101
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:28,301
struck by global earthquakes
stronger than anything in recorded history,

102
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,270
decimating cities around the world,

103
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:33,973
while hurricane-force winds flatten
every single tree in South America,

104
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:37,043
and wildfires consume the continent.

105
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:40,313
The abundance of hydrocarbons
in the Amazon burn to form ash,

106
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:43,049
are cast into the atmosphere, darting the sky

107
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,184
and keeping sunlight from reaching the surface,

108
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,421
dropping temperatures to near freezing worldwide.

109
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:51,224
The ensuing global winter may last for decades,

110
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:56,162
and results in the extinction
of every large animal species, humans included.

111
00:05:56,163 --> 00:06:00,199
We could also mention that every corner
of the planet is covered with radioactive fallout,

112
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,536
but at this point, it doesn't matter that much anymore.

113
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:06,639
This is humanity's extinction event.

114
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,177
The astronauts aboard the International Space Station
get to enjoy a great view for a while,

115
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:16,049
but it's not unlikely that the spray
of rocks blast into orbit will destroy the Station.

116
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,053
Those lucky enough to be in bunkers,
or in submarines deep below the ocean surface,

117
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:23,356
may survive the longest
before they exhaust their food supplies,

118
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:25,525
and have to venture out for more.

119
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:30,530
They'll find the world a
charred, freezing, radioactive wasteland.

120
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,832
The planet, itself, doesn't care at all.

121
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,602
After just a few million years,
the wounds of the explosions have healed

122
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:37,804
and life is thriving,

123
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:41,207
arguably even more so
than when humans were around.

124
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:45,778
If intelligent life emerges again,
it might be able to work out what happened.

125
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,116
When they study geology,
they'll find a bizarre and very thin layer of rock

126
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:53,986
covering the entire world,
enriched in radioactive elements like uranium,

127
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,055
and the other nasty things it decays to,

128
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,592
mixed with rare earth metals
and plastics that humans used.

129
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:05,598
They would probably be very, very confused.

130
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,469
Videos like this one take
well over 1200 hours to finish.

131
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,538
Over the years, we put more
and more effort into research,

132
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,608
conversations with experts,
illustration and animation,

133
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:18,044
sound design and fact-checking.

134
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:21,981
For this video, we put a lot
of extra work into our sources document.

135
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:24,484
You can read how we got to the information in the video,

136
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,185
what our experts thought about it,

137
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:28,554
where they disagreed with each other.

138
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,223
We can take the time to do this,

139
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,992
because of you: our viewers.

140
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:36,863
Because you watch and share our videos, buy our posters,
