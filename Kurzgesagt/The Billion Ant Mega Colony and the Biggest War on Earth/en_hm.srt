1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,959
In nearly every corner of the Earth, ants wage war against each other.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,259
Their weapons are what nature gave them.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,579
Some have strong armor, deadly stingers, or sharp mandibles.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,279
And then there's this tiny, not very impressive ant

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,619
but it rules the biggest empire any ant has ever built.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,799
A colony spanning continents and fighting wars

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,219
that leave millions of casualties.

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,159
Let's take a look at this unlikely warrioress

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:41,479
Linepithema humile, the Argentine ant.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,359
This story begins in the flood plains around the

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,899
Paraná River, in South America.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,319
It's a crowded ant megalopolis where dozens of ant species fight for dominance

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,919
including fire ants, army ants and the rather unimpressive Argentine ant.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,759
It measures only 2 to 3 millimeters in length

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,579
and with its small mandibles.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,699
It's surprising that it survived among its buff competitors.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,359
Their homes are equally unremarkable.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,159
Their colonies range from fairly small to very large

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,899
and could be found anywhere.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,079
Under logs, in loose leaf litter or the former colonies of other ants.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,119
Here, Argentine ants prepare their most effective weapon against their competitors' bodies.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,799
Most ant species have only one queen to produce ants

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,479
while Argentine ants went all in on numbers.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,279
For 120 workers, there's one queen, laying up to 60 eggs a day

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,239
so their economies grow fast, and have millions or billions of individuals.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,719
Teams of queens and workers frequently branch out and found new colonies.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,159
But their strategy has a downside.

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,999
As colonies grow and produce a lot of offspring

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,559
mutations occur and new colonies adapt to new environments.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,059
Their DNA slowly changes from generation to generation, and differences accumulate

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,959
so that after a while the ants that left the colony

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,859
will become more like distant cousins, and start to compete with their mother colony.

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,959
In their native South American range, this is how Argentine ants
behave:

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,399
Within their colonies, they are very co-operative and well organized.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,879
But they fight vicious wars
against other Argentine ant colonies and other ant species.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,739
With equally strong opponents on every side

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,799
the Argentine ant became extremely aggressive

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,239
fighting for every inch of ground

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,179
but it could never dominate its neighbors until humans showed up.

40
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,519
We did what humans do and transported things around the world by ship.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,779
On one of them a few Argentine ant queens hitched a ride as stowaways

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,599
from South America to Madeira and New Orleans.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,759
The Argentine ants suddenly found themselves in a strange world.

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,539
Instead of being surrounded by deadly enemies

45
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,979
they found only victims.

46
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,219
Nobody could fight them effectively.

47
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,039
Because only a few Argentine ant queens were introduced to the outside world

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,899
the resulting colonies had very low genetic diversity.

49
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,779
On top of that, the introduced Argentine ants

50
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,779
kill up to 90 percent of their queens every year

51
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,739
fewer queens, less genetic variation.

52
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,779
So, as these colonies spread across the landscape

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,059
ants that left the colony were no longer considered distant cousins.

54
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,939
As a result, the new colonies form not opposing, but co-operating parties

55
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,039
called super colonies.

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,579
This is a very uncommon strategy in the ant kingdom.

57
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,519
Only a few of the 16,000 ant species

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,639
have evolved super colonies.

59
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,359
A super colony was established on the West Coast of the USA

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,259
and became a base for the tiny ants' global conquest.

61
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,499
Today the Argentine ant inhabits the Mediterranean zones of six continents and many islands.

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,399
This one super colony was especially successful

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,259
establishing sister locations in California

64
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,439
Europe, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia

65
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,079
forming one massive intercontinental mega colony of Argentine ants.

66
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,078
This makes them the largest society on Earth

67
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,979
more numerous than even the human one.

68
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,599
But their success has changed the ecosystems they invaded.

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,539
California is a perfect example of this.

70
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,619
In their greed for more territory

71
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,219
the invading Argentine ants have overrun

72
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,359
and replaced 90% of the native ant species

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,539
including several species of Californian carpenter ants.

74
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,179
Although carpenter ant workers are giants

75
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,399
their colonies have only between 3,000 and 6,000 individuals

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,119
and stand no chance against an expanding super colony of billions of Argentine ants.

77
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,399
Argentine ant workers attack by wiping toxic chemicals on their victims

78
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,799
which irritates the enemy and marks them as a target for other Argentine ants.

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,419
When they attack, the Argentine ants wash over their victims

80
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,579
clinging onto their opponents in groups and pulling apart their limbs.

81
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,579
It doesn't matter how many of them die.

82
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,739
There are always more.

83
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,459
Once the colony is overrun and exterminated

84
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,239
the Argentine ants feed on their victims' brood

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,959
and take over their home and territory.

86
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,659
The Argentine ants' numbers allow them to hunt down and devour

87
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,879
such an excessive mass of different insects

88
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,919
that over time, some species disappear from the ants' territory completely.

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,959
Argentine ants don't care about working with the local flora and fauna.

90
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,879
They consume them and move on.

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,679
And if their next stop happens to be human property

92
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,219
they will rudely make themselves at home there too.

93
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,479
They forage in dumpsters, bowls of pet food

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,299
and sneak into kitchens to claim leftovers.

95
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,359
Not just our homes, our gardens and fields are also impacted by Argentine ants

96
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,739
since they tend to hordes of aphids as their cattle.

97
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,879
The aphids feed from plants and produce a sweet honey dew

98
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,299
which they trade with the ants for protection.

99
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,659
Since the ants have no major enemy to fear in their new homes

100
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,899
the aphids thrive and ultimately kill the plants they live on.

101
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,139
So on top of being a major disruption for the ecosystems they invade

102
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,779
they are also a huge pest for agriculture.

103
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,879
But the rule of the Argentine ant is being challenged.

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,419
Parts of the super colonies have broken off and become their own empires.

105
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,399
A merciless civil war has broken out.

106
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,499
For example, the Lake Hodges super colony has been fighting

107
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,259
against the very large colony for years in San Diego County.

108
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:44,079
A massive war is going on over a dynamic front line, stretching over kilometers.

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,879
An estimated 30 million ants die here each year.

110
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,119
On other fronts, an old acquaintance from the Paraná River has risen from the shadows.

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,499
Red imported fire ants which were accidentally introduced from their old home to the coast of Alabama.

112
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,859
Not only are the red fire ants fierce fighters and more than able to deal with the Argentine ant

113
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,179
they are also able to form Super
Colonies themselves.

114
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,979
Now the old wars from their distant home have been taken to a foreign
battleground.

115
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,859
In the southeastern U.S., the Super Colonies clashed fiercely.

116
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,119
The Argentine ants found themselves outgunned by the fire ants.

117
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,019
The fire ants major workers are more than twice the size as the Argentine ants

118
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,619
and wield venom injecting stingers.

119
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,439
Even though the Argentine ants fought fiercely, the fire ants were too much for them.

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,199
After countless lost battles, the red  imported fire ant exterminated the Argentine ants.

121
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,879
from much of the southeastern U.S.

122
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,079
This is one territory lost, but the Argentine ants will fight on.

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,739
This amazing network of cooperating super colonies is the biggest success in
their history.

124
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,159
And they will not give it up because of a small defeat.

125
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,039
They will stand their ground against any enemy that might arise

126
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:11,799
No matter if it's on the Paraná River, or on one of the large battlefields across the world.
