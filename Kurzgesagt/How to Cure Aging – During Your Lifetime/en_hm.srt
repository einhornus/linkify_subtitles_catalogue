1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,799
Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,579
We're living longer than ever before, which is great,

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:16,899
but an unforeseen consequence of this is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,359
Getting old currently means spending more time in pain.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:29,339
So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing healthspans,

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,819
the part of our lives during which we're disease free.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,219
To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects: aging itself.

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,799
Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress In the last few years,

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,399
with human trials about to begin in the near future.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,139
Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:02,779
INTRO

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,739
1: senescent cells.

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,019
Your cells have an expiration date.

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,619
Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes.

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,179
Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends.

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,119
This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves we have long segments of DNA called telomeres

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,919
that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces, but they shrink with every cell division.

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,559
In some cells, after a number of divisions the telomeres are gone, and the cell becomes a zombie, a senescent cell.

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,099
Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get the more of them are inside you.

20
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,719
They harmed tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age like diabetes and kidney failure.

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,639
But what if you could kill them off?

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,439
Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they pleased.

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,819
Older mice without senescent cells were more active. Their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer.

24
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:13,159
Overall, they lived up to 30 percent longer and in better health than average mice.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,179
Since we can't genetically engineer all the cells in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells.

26
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,659
But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells?

27
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:30,779
Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged, but senescent cells don't.

28
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,839
It turns out that they underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die.

29
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,579
So in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein.

30
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,879
It killed 80 % of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,899
The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair.

32
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:01,059
As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving senescent cells and the first human trials will start soon.

33
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,979
2: NAD+

34
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,119
Cells are made of hundreds of millions of parts.

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,259
They're the structures, machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen.

36
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,639
All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt.

37
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,119
As we age, this process becomes less effective and so parts become crumpled, bunched up,

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,739
or are removed slower, or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need.

39
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,199
One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells ourselves to look after themselves.

40
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,699
At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20.

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:49,419
Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis.

42
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,599
But NAD+ can't enter cells so we can't get it as a pill.

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:01,139
But scientists notice that other more flexible substances could enter cells and would then turn into an NAD+ inside.

44
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:08,719
In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells.

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,319
They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan,

46
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,479
This even got NASA interested,

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,569
which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions.

48
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,959
There are human trials being planned right now,

49
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,399
but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan.

50
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,819
But NAD+ is a serious candidate and could become the first human anti-aging pill.

51
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,699
3: stem cells

52
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,619
Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells,

53
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,979
but they decline as we age and so we decline too.

54
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,699
Without new parts, human bodies break.

55
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,479
In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started to develop diseases

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,519
So they took stem cells from baby mice brains and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice,

57
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,979
more specifically the hypothalamus, a polyp that's involved in regulating a lot of bodily functions.

58
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:25,139
The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by secreting micro RNAs that regulated their metabolism.

59
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:32,779
After 4 months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice and on average, they lived ten percent longer.

60
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,839
Another study took stem cells from mice embryos and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice.

61
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:48,599
As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough their hair regrew faster.

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,639
Conclusion

63
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,019
What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging.

64
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,319
It requires a complex array of different therapies.

65
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,539
We can kill off senescent cells to clear away the junk,

66
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,859
give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap, all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication.

67
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,899
This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice.

68
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,379
There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent, but they are proof of concepts.

69
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,739
To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan, we need human trials.

70
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,259
We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now, and only scratched the surface of these ideas.

71
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,699
The field of healthspan extension needs more attention and funding.

72
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:48,679
If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain
