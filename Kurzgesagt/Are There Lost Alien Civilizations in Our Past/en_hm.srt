1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,480
When we think about alien civilizations we 
tend to look into the vastness of space,  

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,080
to far away planets. But there is another  

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,920
incredibly vast dimension that we might 
be giving too little thought to: time.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,920
Could it be that over the last 
hundreds of millions of years,  

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,920
other civilizations existed on earth? 
Indigenous technological species that  

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,960
rose and died out? And that they or 
their artifacts are buried beneath  

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:43,840
our feet? What does science have to say about 
this and what are the implications for us?

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,760
Life on earth has existed for 4 billion 
years, mostly as single celled organisms  

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,120
until some 540 million years ago the Cambrian 
explosion heralded the age of animals. A huge  

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,040
time window for our indigenous aliens. Where would 
we look for them and what could we hope to find?  

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,080
Sadly we have only one 
civilization to look at: Ourselves.

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,920
Anatomically modern humans emerged around 
300,000 years ago and probably lived in small  

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,680
groups of hunter gatherers, slowly spreading 
around the world. Progress was slow and our  

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,160
lifestyle did not change much, although there 
may have been local bursts of complexity.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,360
Until about 10,000 years ago, when 
the agricultural revolution changed  

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,400
our lifestyle forever, enabling massive 
population growth and technological progress.  

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,520
Rather than just animals with culture and tools 
that would have been invisible from space,  

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,720
we changed the face of the 
planet, cleared forests and  

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,920
constructed cities and temples for our 
gods at breathtaking speeds and scales.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,080
Until about 300 years ago, we became 
an industrial species and yet again  

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,080
our numbers grew exponentially 
as did our impact on the planet.

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,040
We could say that our 300,000 year 
long history has three phases:  

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,920
We were hunter gatherers for 97%, farmers for 
2.9% and industrialists for 0.1% of our history.

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
And yet we are super new on earth.  

25
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,840
On geological timescales, even the sturdiest 
things lose their durability. The oldest large  

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,880
scale surface is in the Negev Desert, a meager 
1.8 million years old. Everything older has been  

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,240
crushed to dust or turned over and it is either 
below the ground, or covered by ice or ocean.  

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Our age, the Anthropocene will be a layer only 
a few centimeters thick in a few million years.

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,080
If there were aliens before us and they 
too went through these three phases,  

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,800
what would remain of them? What can we learn 
about indegnous aliens by looking at ourselves?

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,680
Hunter & Gatherer Aliens

32
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,440
We actually know that in the last few million 
years, there were hunter gatherers aliens.  

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,280
Our ancestors like Homo Erectus and cousins like 
the Neanderthals or Denisovans and probably many  

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,200
more that we haven’t found yet or are lost to 
time forever. They left fragments of their bodies,  

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,920
of weapons and tools and even art. Considering how 
long they existed and how little remains of them,  

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,320
although they lived not that far from our present 
it is easy to think there have been others.

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,000
Intelligent animals like us that could talk and 
use tools and fire, that had culture and art. For  

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,840
the last two million years, most hominins lived as 
hunter-gatherers – so if these aliens never moved  

39
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
up higher on the tech tree, hundreds of different 
species and cultures could have existed without  

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,880
leaving any traces. Their artifacts lost to 
biological and then geological processes.  

41
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,320
At worst they would leave absolutely nothing 
to be found after thousands of years.

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,560
But what about fossils? We talked about how 
unlikely the process of fossilization is in more  

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,320
detail in our dinosaur video, but in a nutshell, 
per hundred thousand years of earth's history  

44
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,040
we only get a handful of good fossils. So we might 
easily just miss fossils of such people – but even  

45
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,520
if we had any, we would not necessarily be 
able to identify them as hunter gatherers.

46
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,040
Agricultural and Empire Aliens

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,960
Looking at humans again, agricultural societies 
left much more to be dug up and found,  

48
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,080
because they used more sophisticated tools made 
from sturdier materials and had to feed millions,  

49
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,200
leaving many more artifacts. Farming 
allowed them to specialize and develop tech  

50
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,056
from writing to navigation, architecture 
and government. Over thousands of years city  

51
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:50,160
states became kingdoms and empires, some 
existing for millennia before they fell.

52
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,040
Many of the buildings or monuments 
they constructed are still around  

53
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,600
and traces of them will exist for a few thousand 
more years. Some only as outlines in the ground,  

54
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,320
but still recognizable to future archaeologists. 
The pyramids are piles of limestone so massive  

55
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,280
that they will probably be around for hundreds 
of thousands of years. And because of the  

56
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,480
greater numbers of humans that lived during our 
farm and empire period, we can expect way more  

57
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,080
fossils and artifacts to be detectable, maybe 
for a few million years before they vanish.

58
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,960
So we can say with confidence that no such 
indigenous alien civilization existed in the  

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,360
last few million years because otherwise we 
would have found something that they left.

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,080
This still leaves a window of hundreds of millions 
of years, back to the emergence of complex life,  

61
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,080
where we would not be able to tell. If there were 
alien pre industrial societies and empires on the  

62
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,760
level of the ancient Romans or Chinese, they would 
have likely disappeared without a trace. Their  

63
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,840
tools, even advanced metals, would have rotted 
away. If they dug up canals, cleared forests and  

64
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,360
built cities, their traces would be very hard to 
distinguish from nature. Maybe there once was an  

65
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,280
empire of cephalopods occupying impressive cities 
in swamps and lakes, made from wood and stone.  

66
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,240
Their engineers flooding land to build wet cities, 
their poets reciting poems in a language of  

67
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,560
colors. Maybe they never industrialized – maybe 
their society was too stable or not inventive  

68
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,560
enough or they never got a chance. A single 
event like an asteroid, an epidemic or an ice age  

69
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,920
could just have deleted their civilization, 
ground up their temples as their soft bodies  

70
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,920
rotted away. Sadly we don’t have the tiniest 
amount of evidence for any such civilization.

71
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,360
After a few million years at best, their 
achievements would have dissolved into nothing.

72
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,480
Industrial Indigenous Aliens

73
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,120
What about industrial civilizations, 
like humanity today? Imagine humans  

74
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,840
died out suddenly, through a pandemic or cosmic 
rays or something like that. What would remain?

75
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
Our impact on the planet is orders of 
magnitude greater than that of our ancestors.  

76
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,200
The fossil record will show a 
great extinction of wildlife  

77
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,960
and an explosion of fossils from human associated 
animals, like rats, cows, pigs and chickens.  

78
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,080
Like the structures of our ancestors, skyscrapers 
and streets and harddrives will basically crumble  

79
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,040
into nothingness in a few millennia. But 
because there were so many humans everywhere,  

80
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,160
for a few million years after our sudden end, 
there would be clear hints of our existence.

81
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,680
The byproducts of our industrial lifestyle might  

82
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,760
actually give us away for some 
hundreds of millions of years .

83
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,040
We use massive amounts of artificial fertilizer 
which redirects earth’s flow of nitrogen that  

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:53,200
is being deposited in the soil. Mining metals 
and rare Earth elements leaves long term scars  

85
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,800
and depletes natural resources. We saturate 
our oceans with plastics that find their way  

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,400
to the ocean floor and may persist 
for hundreds of millions of years.  

87
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,320
There are radioactive elements and their decay, 
unnatural accumulations of elements that do not  

88
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,880
exist outside labs or weapons. And of course, in 
our short industrial history we have changed the  

89
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,640
proportion of CO2 in the air by burning massive 
amounts of fossil fuels, increasing the acidity  

90
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,320
of the oceans and so on. We may already 
have left a mark in the geological record.

91
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
So far we have found no traces of 
an industrial alien civilization.  

92
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,440
No layers of weird chemicals or displaced 
elements. No radioactive layer to indicate  

93
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,960
that once great nations waged nuclear 
war. We do see mass extinctions and  

94
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,520
massive shifts in the fossil records but no 
evidence that they did not occur naturally.

95
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,320
And ironically we’ve hit upon an interesting 
problem here: If industrial societies stress the  

96
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,000
ecosystem enough to cause their own extinction, 
they won’t be around that long. But if they become  

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,960
sustainable their imprint on the geological record 
may be tiny. If past industrial civilizations were  

98
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,840
sustainable before they died out, we may have 
little to no chance of ever knowing about them.

99
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,120
In any case, over hundreds of millions 
of years these signatures may become  

100
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,400
very subtle and get overlooked or interpreted as 
natural. Even if an industrialized alien society  

101
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,400
existed 200 million years ago and lasted 
for 100,000 years, 300 times longer than  

102
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,720
industrial humanity, it still might be 
easy to miss it in the geological record.

103
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,760
In any case, all of this is speculation. In 
the end we should not use our imagination to  

104
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,960
trick ourselves into thinking we know anything 
about our blind spots. Just assuming a thing  

105
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,120
happened because we don’t have evidence 
against it is a trap we should avoid.

106
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,320
So for now, if we look at the 
vastness of time it seems as  

107
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,840
devoid of aliens as the vastness of space. Maybe 
we are alone in this universe and always were.  

108
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,280
Maybe we’ll find traces of others eventually, we 
don’t know. But there is one important takeaway:  

109
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,800
The continuation of our civilization is 
not guaranteed and if we are not careful,  

110
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,760
we may disappear forever. Let’s 
hope that in a few million years,  

111
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,400
there won't be another civilization 
studying our layer in the fossil record.

112
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
It’s frustrating to know there are so 
many things in our past we can’t access.  

113
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,960
At least you can avoid that annoying feeling when 
it comes to other stuff you are interested in,  

114
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,800
