1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,359
when we think about alien civilizations

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,838
we tend to look into the vastness of

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,558
space to far away planets

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,279
but there is another incredibly vast

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,439
dimension that we might be giving too

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,119
little thought to

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,479
time

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,479
could it be that over the last hundreds

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,358
of millions of years other civilizations

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,679
existed on earth

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,919
indigenous technological species that

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,118
rose and died out and that they or their

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,557
artifacts are buried beneath our feet

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,558
what does science have to say about this

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,160
and what are the implications for us

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,329
[Music]

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,558
life on earth has existed for four

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,119
billion years mostly as single-celled

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,238
organisms until some 540 million years

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,878
ago the cambrian explosion heralded the

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,558
age of animals

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,038
a huge time window for our indigenous

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,078
aliens

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,919
where would we look for them and what

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,158
could we hope to find

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,559
sadly we have only one civilization to

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,798
look at ourselves

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,639
anatomically modern humans emerged

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,199
around 300 000 years ago and probably

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,399
lived in small groups of

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,399
hunter-gatherers slowly spreading around

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,919
the world

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,239
progress was slow and our lifestyle

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,919
didn't change much although there may

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,798
have been local bursts of complexity

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,438
until about 10 000 years ago when the

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,599
agricultural revolution changed our

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,919
lifestyle forever enabling massive

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,919
population growth and technological

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,199
progress

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,279
rather than just animals with culture

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,879
and tools that would have been invisible

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,879
from space we changed the face of the

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,438
planet cleared forests and constructed

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,758
cities and temples for our gods at

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,639
breathtaking speeds and scales

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,758
until about 300 years ago we became an

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,398
industrial species and yet again our

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,959
numbers grew exponentially as did our

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,879
impact on the planet

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,398
we could say that our three hundred

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,559
thousand year long history has three

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,679
phases

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,719
we were hunter-gatherers for 97 farmers

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,919
for 2.9 percent and industrialists for

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,719
0.1 percent of our history

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,079
and yet we are super new on earth

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,559
on geological time scales even the

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,759
sturdiest things lose their durability

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,079
the oldest large-scale surface is the

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,759
negev desert omega 1.8 million years old

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,359
everything older has been crushed to

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,598
dust or turned over and it's either

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,919
below the ground or covered by ice or

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,878
ocean

66
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,518
our age the anthropocene will be a layer

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,919
only a few centimeters thick in a few

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,518
million years

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,919
if there were aliens before us and they

70
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,318
too went through these three phases what

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,039
would remain of them what can we learn

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,999
about indigenous aliens by looking at

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,318
ourselves

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,878
hunter-gatherer aliens

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,479
we actually know that in the last few

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,559
million years there were hunter-gatherer

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,759
aliens our ancestors like homo erectus

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,518
and cousins like the neanderthals or

79
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,679
dennis ovens and probably many more that

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,079
we haven't found yet or are lost to time

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,279
forever

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,359
they left fragments of their bodies of

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,479
weapons and tools and even art

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,559
considering how long they existed and

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,399
how little remains of them although they

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,559
live not that far from our present it's

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,359
easy to think there have been others

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,518
intelligent animals like us that could

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,919
talk and use tools and fire that had

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,839
culture and art

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,919
for the last two million years most

92
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,479
hominins lived as hunter-gatherers so if

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,399
these aliens never moved up higher on

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,079
the tech tree hundreds of different

95
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,158
species and cultures could have existed

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,479
without leaving any traces their

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,439
artifacts lost to biological and then

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,759
geological processes

99
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,919
at worst they would leave absolutely

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,999
nothing to be found after thousands of

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,119
years

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,878
but what about fossils

103
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,039
we talked about how unlikely the process

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,199
of fossilization is in more detail in

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,079
our dinosaur video but in a nutshell per

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,759
hundred thousand years of earth's

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,919
history we only get a handful of good

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,438
fossils

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,598
so we might easily just miss fossils of

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,237
such people but even if we had any we

111
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,237
wouldn't necessarily be able to identify

112
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,797
them as hunter-gatherers

113
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,079
agricultural and empire aliens

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,159
looking at humans again agricultural

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,319
societies left much more to be dug up

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,918
and found because they used more

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,918
sophisticated tools made from sturdier

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,079
materials and had to feed millions

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,319
leaving many more artifacts

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,319
farming allowed them to specialize and

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,879
develop tech from writing to navigation

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,359
architecture and government

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,439
over thousands of years city-states

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,918
became kingdoms and empires some

125
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,959
existing for millennia before they fell

126
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,959
many of the buildings or monuments they

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,918
constructed are still around and traces

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,839
of them will exist for a few thousand

129
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,198
more years

130
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,839
some only as outlines in the ground but

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,599
still recognizable to future

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,279
archaeologists

133
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,758
the pyramids are piles of limestone so

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,359
massive that they will probably be

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,038
around for hundreds of thousands of

136
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,239
years

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,079
and because of the greater numbers of

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,079
humans that live during our farm and

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,478
empire period we can expect way more

140
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,719
fossils and artifacts to be detectable

141
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,478
maybe for a few million years before

142
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,959
they vanish so we can say with

143
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,119
confidence that no such indigenous alien

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,599
civilization existed in the last few

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,839
million years because otherwise we would

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,159
have found something that they left

147
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,399
this still leaves a window of hundreds

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,399
of millions of years back to the

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,478
emergence of complex life where we

150
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,478
wouldn't be able to tell

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,478
if there were alien pre-industrial

152
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,399
societies and empires on the level of

153
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,719
the ancient romans or chinese they would

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,439
have likely disappeared without a trace

155
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,079
their tools even advanced metals would

156
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,719
have rotted away if they dug up canals

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,959
cleared forests and built cities their

158
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,959
traces would be very hard to distinguish

159
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,159
from nature

160
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,999
maybe there was once an empire of

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,399
cephalopods occupying impressive cities

162
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,879
in swamps and lakes made from wood and

163
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,318
stone

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,399
their engineers flooding land to build

165
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,599
wet cities their poets reciting poems in

166
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,198
a language of colours

167
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,519
maybe they never industrialized

168
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,758
maybe their society was too stable or

169
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,079
not inventive enough or they never got a

170
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,038
chance

171
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,038
a single event like an asteroid an

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,359
epidemic or an ice age could just have

173
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,758
deleted their civilization ground up

174
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,918
their temples as their soft bodies

175
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,439
rotted away

176
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,839
sadly we don't have the tiniest amount

177
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,559
of evidence for any such civilization

178
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,959
after a few million years at best their

179
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,959
achievements would have dissolved into

180
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,399
nothing

181
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,359
industrial indigenous aliens

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,239
what about industrial civilizations like

183
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,079
humanity today

184
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,638
imagine humans died out suddenly through

185
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,758
a pandemic or cosmic rays or something

186
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,038
like that

187
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,799
what would remain

188
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,038
our impact on the planet is orders of

189
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,719
magnitude greater than that of our

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,439
ancestors the fossil record will show a

191
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,598
great extinction of wildlife and an

192
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,359
explosion of fossils from human

193
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,318
associated animals like rats cows pigs

194
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,918
and chickens

195
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,079
like the structures of our ancestors

196
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,959
skyscrapers and streets and hard drives

197
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,959
will basically crumble into nothingness

198
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,559
in a few millennia

199
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,478
but because there were so many humans

200
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,559
everywhere for a few million years after

201
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,638
our sudden end there would be clear

202
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,799
hints of our existence

203
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,638
the byproducts of our industrial

204
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,799
lifestyle might actually give us away

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,758
for some hundreds of millions of years

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,918
we use massive amounts of artificial

207
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,159
fertilizer which redirects earth's flow

208
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,999
of nitrogen that is being deposited in

209
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,359
the soil

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,679
mining metals and rare earth elements

211
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,918
leaves long-term scars and depletes

212
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,758
natural resources

213
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,839
we saturate our oceans with plastics

214
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,839
that find their way to the ocean floor

215
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,839
and may persist for hundreds of millions

216
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,119
of years

217
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,038
there are radioactive elements and their

218
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,359
decay unnatural accumulations of

219
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,758
elements that don't exist outside labs

220
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,198
or weapons

221
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,198
and of course in our short industrial

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,439
history we have changed the proportion

223
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,918
of co2 in the air by burning massive

224
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,079
amounts of fossil fuels increasing the

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,799
acidity of the oceans and so on

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,198
we may already have left a mark in the

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,359
geological record

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,758
so far we have found no traces of an

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,239
industrial alien civilization

230
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,158
no layers of weird chemicals or

231
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,879
displaced elements no radioactive layer

232
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,798
to indicate that once great nations

233
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,879
waged nuclear war

234
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,359
we do see mass extinctions and massive

235
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,518
shifts in the fossil records but no

236
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,039
evidence that they did not occur

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,239
naturally

238
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,479
and ironically we've hit upon an

239
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,958
interesting problem here if industrial

240
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,359
societies stress the ecosystem enough to

241
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,359
cause their own extinction they won't be

242
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,879
around that long

243
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,119
but if they become sustainable their

244
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,278
imprint on the geological record may be

245
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,479
tiny

246
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,958
if past industrial civilizations were

247
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,199
sustainable before they died out we may

248
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,359
have little to no chance of ever knowing

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,639
about them

250
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,958
in any case over hundreds of millions of

251
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,439
years these signatures may become very

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,159
subtle and get overlooked or interpreted

253
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,599
as natural

254
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,398
even if an industrialized alien society

255
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,119
existed 200 million years ago and lasted

256
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,398
for 100 000 years 300 times longer than

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,639
industrial humanity it still might be

258
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,679
easy to miss it in the geological record

259
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,359
in any case all of this is speculation

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,958
in the end we shouldn't use our

261
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,879
imagination to trick ourselves into

262
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,479
thinking we know anything about our

263
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,838
blind spots

264
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,679
just assuming a thing happened because

265
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,759
we don't have evidence against it is a

266
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,239
trap we should avoid

267
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,879
so for now if we look at the vastness of

268
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,159
time it seems as devoid of aliens as the

269
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,319
vastness of space

270
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,119
maybe we are alone in this universe and

271
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,559
always were

272
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,559
maybe we'll find traces of others

273
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,958
eventually we don't know

274
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,439
but there is one important takeaway the

275
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,919
continuation of our civilization is not

276
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,039
guaranteed and if we're not careful we

277
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,199
may disappear forever

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,759
let's hope that in a few million years

279
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,599
there isn't another civilization

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,399
studying our layer in the fossil record

281
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,479
it's frustrating to know there are so

282
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,039
many things in our past we can't access

283
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,479
at least you can avoid that annoying

284
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,999
