1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,798
For years, people have asked how we make our videos.

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,699
So. let's finally talk about it.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,099
How to Make a Kurzgesagt Video in 1,200 Hours or More

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,219
(Kurzgesagt intro)

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,859
Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,079
But first things first, we need a topic.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,379
Our potential topic list is already endless, and every time we research something, it grows longer.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:35,079
So, we just work on whatever we find exciting at the time. This could be something serious,

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,819
fascinating, personal, or just really stupid. The variety is half the fun.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:48,419
We want to explain complicated things in an easily graspable way and make science-y topics fascinating and beautiful.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,869
But we also want to tell stories and express how we feel about the universe from time to time.

12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,979
Laying the Foundation: Script

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,999
Our research begins by reading books or scientific papers and by talking to different experts who point us in the right direction.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,659
We want to have a fact-based worldview and our videos are trying to reflect that.

15
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,399
So we often have to change our view on an issue while working on it.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,419
Usually after a few weeks of researching we start writing.

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,209
A script begins with a rough first draft that's then rewritten and edited over and over again.

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:31,508
To make sure we don't misrepresent something, We asked experts to fact-check and correct us.

19
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:36,129
Writing is the bottleneck for our videos, and very hard to speed up.

20
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,249
Usually, finishing a script takes between a few weeks and literally years to complete.

21
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,609
Let's Visualize: Illustration

22
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,859
When the script is ready,

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:55,079
we begin sketching out the video. We try to think of visual metaphors, transitions between ideas, and decide which scenes need the most attention.

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,279
On average, 200 panels need to be illustrated in Adobe Illustrator.

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,349
Although we have built up an illustration library, We still do most illustrations from scratch to give our videos a more unique look.

26
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,199
The general idea is to find the right images to the words in the script to explain as clearly as possible,

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,949
while also having interesting things to look at.

28
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,179
Also, here we include all the visual easter eggs.

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,259
In total, two to three illustrators spend 8 to 12 weeks illustrating the video.

30
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,599
Now It's My Turn: Narration

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:39,939
When the whole video is illustrated, the narration is recorded in a small recording studio on a Neumann TLM 103 microphone and Pro Tools

32
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,669
It's important to keep the flow,

33
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,749
so I try to get one version done and then go back through, retaking paragraphs and sentences

34
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,738
Until they feel right and a full version is ready.

35
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,789
It's Alive: Animation

36
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,909
Now the scenes and audio need to be animated.

37
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,119
We make things move in Adobe After Effects and recently, we've begun experimenting with Cinema 4D.

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,619
The first thing to do is take the illustrated scenes apart and organize them.

39
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,389
The hundreds or thousands of parts are then imported into After Effects.

40
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,189
Each character is rigged, so we can move them more naturally.

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:26,419
Aside from a few plugins that help us save time, every single thing that's moving on-screen has been moved manually.

42
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:33,139
So, two to three animators animate scene after scene for about eight to ten weeks in total.

43
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,519
Ending On a High Note: Music and Sound Design

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,309
The final step is the music.

45
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:48,019
Every song is original music composed to the finished video to create a unique atmosphere and to highlight the important parts.

46
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,599
You can listen to all of the songs on SoundCloud and Spotify.

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,239
The icing on the cake are the sound effects.

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,689
Many of you might not even really notice them, which is a shame because they really add an additional layer.

49
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,309
So, try watching a video with headphones if you want to get the full depth of it.

50
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,799
All of these steps happen in parallel, since we usually work on two to four videos at the same time in various stages.

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,739
What we haven't mentioned are the countless revisions and edits.

52
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,479
Every few days, we sit together and review our work and tweak it until it feels just right.

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,099
And that's it - at least 1,200 hours for a single Kurzgesagt video.

54
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,939
As you can imagine, making videos for thousands of hours as a big team

55
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,999
and then putting them on the internet for free is a weird business model.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,039
Over the years, we've relied on a number of different things to stay afloat.

57
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,999
Commercial work for NGOs, startups, or corporations

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,429
Sponsorships and grants by companies or organizations.

59
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:56,809
We struck a deal with Funk from German public broadcasting to revive the German channel and with Wix to start a Spanish channel.

60
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,889
But the reality is, we can only do what we do because of you.

61
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:06,799
Our two most important sources of income by far come from your direct support,

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,559
merchandise and Patreon.

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,529
So, if you want to help us stay afloat and keep making more videos,

64
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:21,199
You can directly support Kurzgesagt by getting something beautiful from our store, or by becoming a patreon and joining the bird army.

65
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,779
Don't feel obligated though. Watching, engaging, or sharing our videos is already helping us a lot.

66
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:34,169
But if you want to support us directly, thank you so much. You're making our videos free for everyone.

67
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:40,159
You are enabling us to practice and improve, to stay independent and to work on ambitious projects

68
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,709
that would be too scary or too big otherwise.

69
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,549
Kurzgesagt did not start with an end goal in mind.

70
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:54,029
It began as a personal project because it felt good to make something with time and love, and this is still true today.

71
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,279
Making these videos is our goal. Doing the work every day and getting better.

72
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,149
To make science beautiful and interesting.

73
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,389
Thank you so much for sticking with us for seven years and from our first subscriber to the ten millionth.

74
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,989
This journey has been so wild and so much fun, and we can't wait to share the stuff

75
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,259
We're working on right now with you; in a year, or maybe two.

76
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,859
We want to make matter videos like this from time to time now.

77
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,739
If you want to ask us questions that you want us to answer, you can do so on Reddit. Link in the description.

78
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,039
(Nice music)

79
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:46,780
