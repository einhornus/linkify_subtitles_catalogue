1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,939
Humans are proud of a lot of things, from particle accelerators to poetry to Pokemon.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,899
All of them made possible because of something humans value extremely highly:

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,179
Intelligence.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,899
We think of intelligence as a trait like height or strength,

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,079
but when we try to define it, things get fuzzy.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,019
In a nutshell, intelligence is a mechanism to solve problems.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,239
Especially the problem of staying alive, which involves finding food and shelter,

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,479
fighting sexual competitors, or fleeing from predators.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,299
Intelligence is not a single thing;

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,419
it includes the ability to gather knowledge, to learn, be creative, form strategies, or engage in critical thinking.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,719
It manifests itself in a huge variety of behaviors.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,599
From hardwired or instinct like reactions to different degrees of learning, to some sort of awareness.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,859
But not all scientists agree where it begins or what even should count as intelligence.

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,879
To make this even more complicated,

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,579
intelligence is also connected to consciousness since awareness is helpful for problem-solving.

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,039
But we're exploring consciousness in other videos, so today we'll leave it aside.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,959
Okay,

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,759
Intelligence isn't exactly clear-cut, so maybe we can think of it as more like a flexible set of skills:

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,979
A toolbox.

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,699
Basic tools.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:30,979
The most basic tools in the intelligence toolbox are the ability to gather information, to save it, and to use it to learn.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,679
Information about the world is gathered through senses such as vision, sound, smell, touch or taste,

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,119
and helps us navigate and react to the external world appropriately.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,019
But living things also need to keep track of the state of their own bodies,

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,919
monitoring things like hunger and fatigue.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,359
Information is the basis of action for all living things,

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,079
and without it, you're at the mercy of your surroundings, unable to react appropriately, or flexibly.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,879
Information is much more powerful if we can keep and save it, so the second tool is memory.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,859
Memory is the ability to save and recall information,

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,459
so a living being doesn't have to start from scratch every time it perceives something relevant.

31
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:23,359
Memories can be about events, places, and associations, but also behaviors like hunting or foraging methods.

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,139
Some of these, like flying, have to be repeated over and over until they're mastered.

33
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,239
This is what we call learning, the process of putting together a sequence of thoughts or actions.

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,019
Basically a string of repeatable behaviors that can be varied and adapted.

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:46,339
These three tools enable seemingly stupid creatures to act in surprisingly intelligent ways.

36
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,639
The acellular slime mold, which is basically just a single huge slimy cell,

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,119
shows behavior similar to an animal with a simple brain.

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,419
When put in a maze with food at one end,

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,199
the slime mold explores its surroundings, and marks its path with slime trails,

40
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,759
sort of, smearing memories on the ground.

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,139
As it continues exploring, it avoids the marked pathways and finds its way to the food.

42
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,699
Instead of blindly getting stuck in dead-ends, the slime mold adapts its behavior to save time and effort.

43
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,739
This behavior is hardwired, and scientists can't agree if that's intelligent,

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,659
although it does give the slime mold a certain advantage.

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,759
Bees are an example of more adaptive smart behavior.

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,899
Scientists trained bumblebees to move a colored ball into a goal post for a sugar reward.

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,819
Not only were the bees very skillful at this behaviour, which isn't natural to them,

48
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,919
they got more efficient over time.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,359
When several balls were available, bees chose the ball that lay closest to the goal,

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,859
even if it was a different color than the ball they were trained with.

51
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,979
For more challenging problems, we need even more flexibility:

52
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,399
Fancier tools.

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,339
Building on the basic tools, more complex animals have a wider range of problems they can solve.

54
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,299
They can memorize all kinds of associations, connections, and mechanical tricks.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,079
We'll call this tool “The Library of Knowledge”.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,518
Take raccoons. Their favorite kind of food is human food.

57
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,219
Their approach to getting hold of such treats depends upon an assortment of theoretical and practical skills,

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,199
that makes them master burglars, able to open windows or pick locks.

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,319
In a study, raccoons were given boxes secured with different kinds of locks,

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,399
like latches, bolts, plugs, or push bars.

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,719
They needed less than 10 attempts to figure out how to open each box.

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,839
Even when different locks were put together into increasingly difficult combinations that had to be solved in the right order,

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,418
and with different amounts of strength.

64
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,939
A year later, the raccoons still remembered how to open the boxes,

65
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,239
and were as fast as when they had first solved the puzzle.

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,939
Beyond our library of associations and skills, the most impressive tool in our box is creativity,

67
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,719
a sort of mental duct tape.

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,359
Being creative means producing something new and valuable from apparently unrelated things.

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,939
In the context of intelligence this means making new and unusual connections.

70
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,959
Pairing input with memories and skills, to come up with a unique solution to a problem.

71
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,239
In another raccoon study, researchers showed the animals that by dropping pebbles into a water tank,

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,439
they could raise the water level enough to reach a marshmallow floating at the top.

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,119
One raccoon came up with a much better solution: it tipped the tub over.

74
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,259
Another facet of creativity is applying a new resource to a task:

75
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,999
Physical tools.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,059
Like primates that use sticks to fish for termites in trees, or some octopuses,

77
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,459
which assemble collected coconut shells around themselves as a sort of portable armor to hide from enemies.

78
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,499
Collecting materials for later use is connected to an even more advanced dimension of problem-solving:

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,979
Planning.

80
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:07,939
Planning means considering the activities required for a desired goal and putting them together in a plan.

81
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,239
When unforeseen circumstances and new possibilities present themselves,

82
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,059
they need to be assessed according to whether they match the plan or not.

83
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,259
An example of this intelligent behavior is hoarding food to eat it later.

84
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,239
This is an instinctive behavior in squirrels.

85
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,479
But even though hiding food comes instinctively to them,

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,039
they still need to use advanced thinking skills to make the best decisions.

87
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,439
Squirrels examine every nut and weigh the time and effort it would take to hide it,

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,199
against the benefits they would get from each one.

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,299
Damaged or low-fat nuts are eaten right away,

90
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,899
while nuts that still need to ripen go on the stockpile.

91
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,619
Squirrels also pretend to bury nuts when they feel watched.

92
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,199
These empty caches distract rivals from their real treasure.

93
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,939
This is pretty advanced strategizing because to make a plan to distract someone else,

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,419
you first have to be aware that there are others like you that want the same things.

95
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,499
The more complex the problem, the more tools are needed in combination to solve it.

96
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,959
So the more tools there are, the more flexibility a being has to solve the challenges life throws at them.

97
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,519
But even for complex problems, each animal's individual situation is what counts.

98
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,619
Squirrels are omnivores that defend their territories fiercely.

99
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,419
For them, it makes sense to remember where there's food in different locations

100
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,319
and trick their enemies to improve their chances of survival.

101
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,159
Sheep don't have any such refined tricks up their sleeve, but they don't need to.

102
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,779
They are grazers and live in flocks.

103
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,479
The skills relevant to them are social.

104
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,379
They recognize and remember many different sheep, and even humans for years; a completely different skill.

105
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,639
Evolving and retaining a complex set of mental abilities they might never use would be a waste of resources for them.

106
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,419
Humans went the opposite way and invested in an unusually diverse intelligence toolkit.

107
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,339
While this was helpful, by accident we added another set of tools on top:

108
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,559
Culture.

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,819
No single person could ever build a space rocket or particle accelerator.

110
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,779
But thanks to our ability to work together and to share knowledge across generations,

111
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,599
we can overcome challenges beyond any single individual's ability.

112
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,599
This allowed us to shape the planet to our liking.

113
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,999
We also created new problems in the process: sudoku, tax forms, string theory.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,359
But also rapid climate change and antibiotic resistance.

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,719
To solve these, we'll need to look past short-term survival and think about the distant future.

116
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,979
We have the toolbox, we just need to use it.

117
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,679
Speaking of tools for learning, we've heard from many teachers that are using our infographic posters in class.

118
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,739
So we asked what would help them the most and made an education edition for teachers, students, and everyone else.

119
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,239
They're slightly larger posters about various things that we'll expand over time.

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
From a periodic table, to a world map or the human body.

121
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,639
You can get them in our shop and support us if you want.

122
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,939
And let us know which poster topics you want for your room or classroom.

123
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,039
This video was part two of a three-part video series relating to big questions of life and the universe,

124
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,179
made possible thanks to a grant from the Templeton World charity foundation.

125
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,199
You'll find our sources and further reading in the video description.
