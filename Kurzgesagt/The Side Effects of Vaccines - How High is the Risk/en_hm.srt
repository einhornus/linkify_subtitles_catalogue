1
00:00:00,908 --> 00:00:04,778
Vaccines are celebrated
for their part in fighting disease.

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:06,346
But, a growing group of people

3
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:10,717
seem to believe that they endanger
our health, instead of protecting it.

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,954
The Internet is full of stories
about allergic reactions,

5
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:15,488
the onset of disabilities,

6
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:18,525
and even death following
vaccination appointments.

7
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:22,529
And, it's true vaccines can have side effects.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:37,243
Let's look at how they work,
and how dangerous they really are.

9
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:41,047
Your immune system is a
complex army of billions of cells.

10
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:42,148
Soldiers,

11
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,683
intelligence cells,

12
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:45,719
and weapons factories.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,321
Every day, you're attacked countless times,

14
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:51,524
but your immune soldiers alone
usually deal with that,

15
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:53,727
so you don't even notice.

16
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:55,962
If an infection becomes serious though,

17
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:59,199
our intelligence cells gather
intel about the attackers

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,735
and activate our weapons factories.

19
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:04,738
You know the weapon: antibodies.

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,909
They're like targeted missiles produced
specifically to combat the invader.

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,047
Unfortunately, this process takes
several days to complete.

22
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:17,884
That gives intruders
a lot of time to do damage.

23
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:19,786
Contrary to popular wisdom,

24
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:22,589
what doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger.

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,526
Our bodies really don't want
to fight serious wars over and over,

26
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:29,496
so our immune system came up
with an ingenious way

27
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:32,332
to get stronger and stronger over time.

28
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:36,302
If we fight an enemy that is dangerous
enough to trigger our heavy weapons,

29
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:40,140
our immune system automatically
creates memory cells.

30
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:44,577
Memory cells remain in our body
for years, in a deep sleep.

31
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:47,981
They do nothing but remember.

32
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,350
When an enemy attacks for a second time,

33
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,485
the slumbering memory cells awaken,

34
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:56,456
and order coordinated attacks
and the production of antibodies.

35
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:58,892
This is so fast and effective,

36
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:02,996
that many infections you beat once
will never make you sick again.

37
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,765
You might even be immune
against them forever.

38
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:09,135
Which is also why little kids are constantly ill;

39
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:12,172
they don't have enough memory cells yet.

40
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:18,578
And this beautiful natural mechanism
is what we build on when we use vaccines.

41
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,548
How Vaccines Work

42
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,683
As great as memory cells are,

43
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:28,822
obtaining them through an infection
is unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.

44
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:32,392
Vaccines are a way of tricking
our bodies into making memory cells,

45
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:34,594
and becoming immune to a disease.

46
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:37,430
They pretend to be a dangerous infection.

47
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:41,367
One way of doing this is to inject
invaders that can't do harm.

48
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:45,271
For example, by killing them,
or by ripping them into pieces.

49
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:49,809
Our immune systems deal with
these kinds of vaccines pretty easily.

50
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,546
Sometimes, it's necessary to make
our immune system work harder though,

51
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:56,783
to produce even more memory cells.

52
00:02:56,784 --> 00:02:59,419
Live vaccines are the real deal.

53
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,423
An enemy that can punch back is
a bigger challenge than a dead one.

54
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:06,793
But this also sounds like
a sort-of horrible idea.

55
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:08,661
What if the germs win?

56
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:14,100
To avoid that, we breed a sort-of
weak cousin of the real germ in the lab.

57
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:19,706
Just powerful enough to annoy the immune
system, and create enough memory cells.

58
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:23,810
Okay, so these are the basic
principles of vaccine use.

59
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:26,813
They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies

60
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:30,450
that makes us become immune
against very dangerous diseases.

61
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:33,319
Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,788
that we need a new vaccine every year,

63
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,627
but most vaccines protect us
for years, or even a lifetime.

64
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:42,929
But, there's a catch.

65
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,666
Like everything in life,
vaccines have another side:

66
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,268
Side effects.

67
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,039
What are they, and what happens
if your child develops one?

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,775
The Risks of Vaccines

69
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,147
It's complicated to directly compare the side
effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases.

70
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,215
For example,

71
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:06,052
hundreds of millions of people are
vaccinated against measles in the West,

72
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:10,990
but there were only 83,000
cases in Europe in 2018.

73
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:15,395
So, with numbers that different,
even mild side effects can seem scary

74
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:20,300
compared to the bad effects of a disease
that we don't see as much anymore.

75
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,670
Before the measles vaccine
became available in 1963,

76
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:28,808
virtually every single child on Earth
contracted measles at some point.

77
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:33,813
An estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s.

78
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:36,249
Every single year.

79
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,786
But are measles really that
dangerous in the year 2019?

80
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:43,256
With our advanced healthcare
and new technologies,

81
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:47,460
are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects?

82
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:50,830
Let's do a thought experiment
based on real numbers.

83
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:54,033
Imagine a developed country
in a parallel world.

84
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:58,037
It has good healthcare but
people stop vaccinating.

85
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,242
In this scenario, let's say ten
million children caught measles.

86
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:04,043
What happens?

87
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:10,750
Nine million eight hundred thousand, or 98%,
will get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash.

88
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:16,356
Up to 800,000 of them, or 8%,
will suffer from dangerous diarrhea.

89
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:23,129
700,000, or 7%, will suffer from an ear infection,
which can lead to permanent hearing loss.

90
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,702
600,000 kids, or 6%, will suffer from pneumonia
-- the most dangerous effect of measles.

91
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:33,172
It, alone, will kill 12,000 children.

92
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:38,511
Up to 10,000 children, or 0.1%,
will get encephalitis.

93
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:44,284
2,500 kids, or 0.025%, will contract SSPE,

94
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:47,353
a disease where the measles
virus lingers in their brain

95
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:49,822
and kills them a few years later.

96
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:50,923
Taken together,

97
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:56,929
around 2.5 million children will suffer from
somewhat serious effects from measles.

98
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,668
And, about 20,000 children
will be killed by measles.

99
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,169
It doesn't stop here though.

100
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,173
The kids who beat measles are left with
a severely damaged immune system

101
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:10,076
that needs a lot of time to regenerate.

102
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:13,613
Time for other diseases to do further damage.

103
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:16,449
Aside from that, what's almost guaranteed

104
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,620
is that your kids will have a really
bad time for about two weeks.

105
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:23,356
Okay, but what about vaccines?

106
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:26,292
It's only fair to look at these risks, too.

107
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:28,594
So, let's repeat our thought experiment.

108
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:32,899
But, this time, we vaccinate ten
million children with MMR.

109
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,635
What would theoretically happen here?

110
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,170
After being vaccinated,

111
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:41,007
of our 10 million kids,
around ten percent get a fever.

112
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:45,011
500,000, or 5%, will get a mild rash.

113
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:48,581
Up to 100, or 0.001%,

114
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:53,052
might have a serious allergic reaction
and will have to be treated.

115
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:57,023
Up to ten boys, or 0.0001%,

116
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:59,959
might get inflammation of the genitalia.

117
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,764
And up to ten kids in total, or 0.0001%,

118
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:08,735
might get the most serious
side effect: encephalitis.

119
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:11,404
So, we vaccinated ten million kids.

120
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:16,709
In total, around one hundred and twenty had
side effects that were somewhat serious.

121
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,215
Thanks to good medical treatment in developed
regions, almost all of them will be fine.

122
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,250
What about autism?

123
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:28,688
The connection of autism and vaccines
stems from one source

124
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,891
that has been disproven countless times.

125
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:35,194
We'll link to further reading
and videos in the description.

126
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:41,401
But, in 2019, it's fair to say that
vaccines do not cause autism.

127
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:44,070
All right, but what about deaths?

128
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:50,343
It's really hard to say if even a single one of
our 10 million vaccinated kids would die.

129
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,080
We really did look hard and
talked to a lot of different experts.

130
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:55,815
If we ignore self-reporting,

131
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:59,619
we could only come up with a tiny
handful of documented cases

132
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,359
for all the hundreds of millions of children
who received the MMR vaccine since 1971.

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,997
Measles are many, many thousands of
times more dangerous for your child

134
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:15,835
than even the absolute worst
case of vaccine side effects.

135
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:20,473
You have to search for lethal vaccine side
effects with a huge magnifying glass

136
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:24,110
and, even then, it's very hard
to find confirmed cases.

137
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:29,015
While, deaths from measles
are real and easy to find.

138
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:34,720
In 2017 alone, 110,000 people
died from measles worldwide.

139
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:39,024
Statistically, today,
300 children will die of measles.

140
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:42,128
One since this video started.

141
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,997
You can compare vaccines to seatbelts.

142
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:49,101
Are there weird freak accidents where
someone gets killed by their seatbelt?

143
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:50,970
Well, yes.

144
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:55,408
But, do you personally think it's safer
to not put a seatbelt on your kid?

145
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,409
Wait a second!

146
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,911
What if your kid is actually allergic?

147
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:03,616
What if none of the things we've said
applies to your specific situation?

148
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:08,821
In this case, you need to become the
greatest vaccination promoter of all.

149
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:14,193
Because if your children can't be vaccinated,
only the collective can protect them.

150
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,162
This is called herd immunity,

151
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:20,533
and it's the only thing that
can protect your unvaccinated child.

152
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:23,769
Herd immunity means that enough
people are immune to a disease,

153
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,341
that it can't spread, and dies
before it reaches its victims.

154
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:30,676
But to accomplish this for measles alone,

155
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:35,748
95% of the people around you
need to be vaccinated.

156
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,783
Conclusion

157
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:43,422
The problem with the debate about vaccines
is that it's not fought on a level playing field.

158
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,826
While the pro-vaccine side argues
with studies and statistics,

159
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:50,863
the arguments against them are
usually a wild mixture of gut feeling,

160
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:52,999
anecdotes, and misinformation.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,869
And feelings are often immune to facts.

162
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,338
We'll not convince anybody
by screaming at them.

163
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,544
But we can't hide from the reality
of what anti-vaccine conspiracies do.

164
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:07,980
They kill babies too young to be vaccinated.

165
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:11,717
They kill healthy children that are just unlucky.

166
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:15,922
They bring serious diseases back
from the verge of extinction.

167
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:20,760
And, the biggest side effect
of vaccines is fewer dead children.

168
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:24,163
Vaccines are one of
the most powerful tools we have

169
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:28,267
to eradicate the monsters that
most of us have already forgotten.

170
00:10:28,268 --> 00:00:00,907
Let's not bring the beasts back!

171
00:00:00,908 --> 00:00:00,907
Vaccines are celebrated
for their part in fighting disease.

But, a growing group of people

177
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:06,346
seem to believe that they endanger
our health, instead of protecting it.

How Vaccines Work

294
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:21,548
As great as memory cells are,

295
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:21,548
As great as memory cells are,

00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,683
As great as memory cells are,

297
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:23,683

309
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:37,430
One way of doing this is to inject

An enemy that can punch back is
a bigger challenge than a dead one.

What if the germs win?

336

To avoid that, we breed a sort-of

weak cousin of the real germ in the lab.

339
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:14,100
Just powerful enough to annoy the immune
system, and create enough memory cells.

340
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:14,100
Just powerful enough to annoy the immune
system, and create enough memory cells.

Just powerful enough to annoy the immune
system, and create enough memory cells.

342
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:19,706
Okay, so these are the basic
principles of vaccine use.

Okay, so these are the basic

00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:23,810
They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies

348
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:26,813
that makes us become immune
against very dangerous diseases.

00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:26,813
that makes us become immune

351
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:30,450
Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often

Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often

354
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,319
that we need a new vaccine every year,

that we need a new vaccine every year,

356
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,788
that we need a new vaccine every year,

357
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:35,788
but most vaccines protect us
for years, or even a lifetime.

358
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:35,788
but most vaccines protect us

359
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,627
but most vaccines protect us

360
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:40,627
But, there's a catch.

361
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:40,627
But, there's a catch.

362
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:42,929
But, there's a catch.

363
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:42,929
Like everything in life,
vaccines have another side:

Like everything in life,
vaccines have another side:

365
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,666
Like everything in life,
vaccines have another side:

366
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:46,666
Side effects.

367
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:46,666
Side effects.

368
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,268
Side effects.

369
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:48,268
What are they, and what happens
if your child develops one?

370
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:48,268

375
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:55,775
It's complicated to directly compare the side
effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases.

00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:55,775
It's complicated to directly compare the side

It's complicated to directly compare the side
effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases.

378
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:01,147
For example,

379
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:01,147
For example,

380
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,215
For example,

381
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:02,215
hundreds of millions of people are
vaccinated against measles in the West,

00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:02,215

vaccinated against measles in the West,

00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:06,052
hundreds of millions of people are
vaccinated against measles in the West,

384
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:06,052
but there were only 83,000
cases in Europe in 2018.

but there were only 83,000
cases in Europe in 2018.

387
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:10,990
So, with numbers that different,
even mild side effects can seem scary

388
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:10,990
So, with numbers that different,
even mild side effects can seem scary

So, with numbers that different,
even mild side effects can seem scary

390
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:15,395
compared to the bad effects of a disease
that we don't see as much anymore.

Every single year.

405
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:36,249
But are measles really that
dangerous in the year 2019?

Aside from that, what's almost guaranteed

480

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:32,899
What would theoretically happen here?

What would theoretically happen here?

497
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,635
What would theoretically happen here?

498
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:35,635
After being vaccinated,

525
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:08,735

528
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:11,404
In total, around one hundred and twenty had

552
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:44,070
It's really hard to say if even a single one of

00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:15,835
You have to search for lethal vaccine side

Well, yes.

600
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:50,970
But, do you personally think it's safer
to not put a seatbelt on your kid?

612
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:03,616
In this case, you need to become the
