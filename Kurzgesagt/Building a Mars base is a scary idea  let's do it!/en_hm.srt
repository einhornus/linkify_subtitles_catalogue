1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,189
From hostile deserts,
to lonely islands and the highest mountains,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,067
wherever there is space
to expand into humans do so.

3
00:00:08,068 --> 00:00:11,689
So, it's hardly surprising
that we're already making preparations

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,069
to set foot on Mars,

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,549
and to create the first
permanent colony outside of Earth --

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,919
maybe even terraform another planet
and turn it into a second blue home.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,759
But wait,

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,299
before we can get to the nice future stuff,

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,479
we first have to complete
the second phase of colonization;

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,749
creating a semi-permanent outpost

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,836
to prepare the ground for a larger human presence.

12
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:46,709
But doing so will be gruesome.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,688
Even for an expansionist species like us,
Mars is extreme.

14
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,388
At first glance,
Mars seems familiar --

15
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,549
polar ice caps,
large valleys,

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,299
liquid water under its surface,

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,685
and a day barely longer than Earth's.

18
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,119
The ideal place for us to go.

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,509
Unfortunately, Mars
is actually a cold, radioactive desert

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,301
where the ground is poisonous
and breathing is impossible.

21
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:13,006
Mars is awful.

22
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:16,279
You almost certainly don't want to go there.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,939
The pioneers doing the hard work on Mars
will have an intensely stressful life,

24
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,079
filled with incredibly challenging problems

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,279
never encountered before.

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,119
But there are plenty of people
willing to do that work

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,599
and we have the technology
to enable them to do it.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,229
For this video, we will assume
there have been prior missions to Mars

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,139
to scout out a good place for an outpost,

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,029
store resources and equipment,

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,979
and that there's already a moon base

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,680
that serves as a hub for Mars missions.

33
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,339
The first major challenge for our outpost,

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,652
is the fact that Mars is very energy poor.

35
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,519
Because of its distance from the Sun,

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,324
solar power is only 40% as effective as on Earth.

37
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:58,949
But even this weakened sunlight
is often obscured for days

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,124
by enormous dust storms.

39
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:04,383
Solar power alone
will probably not be enough.

40
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:09,019
Alternatives, such as wind power,
and geothermal energy are also unfeasible

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,729
as there's hardly any atmosphere
and Mars' interior is much too cold.

42
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,297
Initially, nuclear technology
might be the only option.

43
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:21,849
Since Mars doesn't have
easily accessible radioactive elements,

44
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,527
the nuclear fuel needs to come
from Earth along with the reactor.

45
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:30,619
If we do set it up, it could power
our small outpost for the first few years.

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,196
Unfortunately, all that energy
won't be very useful if we can't breathe.

47
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,529
Mars' atmosphere is only 1% as dense as Earth's,

48
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,692
and mostly made up of CO2.

49
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:45,429
So, now habitats need to be pressurized
and filled with an artificial atmosphere

50
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,529
made of nitrogen and oxygen --

51
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,479
Which comes with more problems.

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,589
Corners and flat walls are weak points

53
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,459
so the habitats will have rounded and smooth shapes

54
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,709
to handle the stress of great pressure differences
between the interior and exterior.

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,319
The airlocks need to be very airtight
and work perfectly every time.

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,659
Without an extensive magnetosphere, or a dense atmosphere,

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,120
half of all radiation coming from space reaches the ground.

58
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:16,839
A person on the surface would be subjected
to 50 times the radiation that they would be on Earth.

59
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,119
Three years on the surface of Mars
exceeds the radiation dose limits

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,879
imposed on NASA astronauts for their entire career.

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,490
This increases cancer risks significantly.

62
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:33,289
To prevent that, we could shield our habitats
with a thick layer of frozen CO2,

63
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,252
that can be harvested directly from the atmosphere.

64
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:41,084
Covering the dry ice with a meter of dirt,
would further increase the level of protection.

65
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:44,104
Sadly, this means almost no windows.

66
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:48,009
From the inside,
most living spaces will be windowless tunnels.

67
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,387
From the outside,
they'll look like burial mounds.

68
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:54,099
All of this would still not hold back all the radiation,

69
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,299
but reduce it just enough
to be survivable for long periods of time.

70
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,229
It won't, however, protect anyone who ventures outside.

71
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,049
So, remote-controlled robots
will be used for routine work on the surface,

72
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,709
while our crew stays inside.

73
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,419
Staying inside is a good idea for another reason:

74
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,868
Mars dust.

75
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,819
It's much finer than dust on Earth,

76
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,849
so it could find its way
into the gears or electronics of our machines.

77
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,759
Because it's also very dry, it's electro-statically charged;

78
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,399
sticking to everything, like spacesuits.

79
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,229
It will be impossible to avoid carrying
lots of Mars dust into our habitat,

80
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,436
and into the lungs of our crew.

81
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:37,046
To make this even worse, Mars' soil
is filled with very toxic perchlorate salts.

82
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:39,656
Constant exposure could be deadly.

83
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:41,906
This problem can still be overcome though.

84
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:45,949
Space suits, for example, could be made in a way
that they never truly enter the base,

85
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,906
but stay attached to the outside of the habitats.

86
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:50,233
Okay, great.

87
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:54,169
Now we've safely isolated humans in terms of energy and air,

88
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,119
and protected them from cancer,
we just need to feed them.

89
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,149
Water is easy to come by if a settlement
is positioned near the Martian poles

90
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,921
with their thick layers of ice.

91
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:07,409
Growing food is a different kind of challenge though.

92
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,399
Mars' soils are alkaline

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,109
and lack the vital nitrogen compounds
that plants need to grow.

94
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,639
Before we can grow anything,
we will have to decontaminate the soil

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,479
which is difficult and expensive.

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,569
Then, the soil can be fertilized using recycled biological waste.

97
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,698
All of this will take a lot of time,
and is very energy-intensive.

98
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:32,469
So, we might use aquaponics
to raise fish and plants together --

99
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,210
Making the astronauts' diets
more varied and tasty at the same time.

100
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:42,001
This will be an important
psychological boost for our overworked crew.

101
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:45,529
All of these things don't solve one fundamental problem though:

102
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,489
Mars has only 38 percent of Earth's surface gravity,

103
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,849
which could cause muscle-wasting,
bone loss, and cardiovascular problems.

104
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,069
While this might be solved in the future
by setting up rotating living spaces,

105
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,799
for now, our crew has to live with low gravity

106
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,699
and exercise a lot to slow the degradation down.

107
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,999
The crews will probably have to rotate every few years,

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,499
after being stuck indoors
in tight spaces without windows.

109
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,279
With the same people,
performing the same routines day-in day-out

110
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,839
with little contact from the outside world,

111
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,329
and a lot to worry about.

112
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,379
Like Antarctic scientists or submarine staff,

113
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,039
they will undergo intense psychological screening

114
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,924
to make sure they're mentally resilient enough
to handle this lifestyle for several years.

115
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:36,749
Establishing the first real infrastructure
on Mars will be extremely taxing work

116
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,089
that only a group of very determined,
and competent, people can do.

117
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,929
Luckily, we have enough of these on Earth.

118
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,199
And there you have it!

119
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,369
A small Mars base that will survive
for at least a few decades --

120
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,719
as long as it's getting a constant supply of resources,

121
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,022
parts, nuclear fuel, and crews from Earth.

122
00:06:56,023 --> 00:07:00,369
Unfortunately, Mars and Earth
are separated by millions of kilometers

123
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,207
and orbital periods that leave
only a narrow travel window every two years.

124
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,409
If there's an emergency in the colony,

125
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,999
Earth wouldn't be able to help
until the next travel window opens.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,429
Helpers may arrive on a planet
filled with corpses.

127
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,369
Settling Mars will be the toughest challenge we have ever faced.

128
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,202
It will be gruesome work to establish
the infrastructure we need.

129
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:26,633
But we're stubborn,
and we like extreme challenges.

130
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:30,859
If we push through Phase Two of colonization,
anything is possible.

131
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,689
Cities illuminating the dark Martian night,

132
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,669
a hub for travel between the planets,

133
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,529
industries setting foot in orbit

134
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,239
terraforming a true multi-planetary future.

135
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,389
Going to Mars is hard but worth it.

136
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,209
And if we're lucky, we might be around
long enough to see it happening

137
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,589
and cheer on the people who take on these challenges

138
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,109
for the benefit of us all.

139
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,429
Figuring out complex stuff
is one of the best feelings ever.

140
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,219
Especially if you don't have
to do it all by yourself.

141
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,559
Our friends from Brilliant
can help you out with that part!

142
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,362
Brilliant is a problem-solving website
with a hands-on approach.

143
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,249
Instead of just dropping tricky concepts in front of you,

144
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,269
they help you unravel them bit-by-bit
and build up to an interesting conclusion.

145
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,867
This way, science becomes something
you actually do actively, and not only hear about.

146
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:24,529
With Brilliant, you can bear down

147
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,349
on dozens of interesting courses and puzzles about topics,

148
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,659
like solar energy, gravity, and astronomy.

149
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,678

With Brilliant, you finish your day a little bit smarter.

154
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,249
And, no Mars dust to deal with.

155
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,534
We promise!

156
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,318
Can't get enough of Mars?

157
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:56,694
We've also made a poster about it.

158
00:08:56,695 --> 00:09:00,489
You can learn some more
about the hardships of Mars colonization,

159
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,750
or just look at the pretty colors.

160
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,000
Go get it here!
