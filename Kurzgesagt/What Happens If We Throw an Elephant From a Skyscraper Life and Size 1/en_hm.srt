1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,279
Let's start this video by throwing a
mouse, a dog, and an elephant

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,499
from a skyscraper onto something soft.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,079
Let's say, a stack of mattresses.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,359
The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment,

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,619
before it shakes itself off,

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,199
and walks away pretty annoyed,

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,499
because that's a very rude thing to do.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,999
The dog breaks all of its bones

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,259
and dies in an unspectacular way,

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,059
and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,339
and has no chance to
be annoyed.

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,859
Why does the mouse survive,

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,639
but the elephant and dog don't?

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,879
The answer is size.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,699
Size is the most underappreciated 
regulator of living things.

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,199
Size determines everything about our biology,

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,599
how we are built, how we
experience the world, how we live and die.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,749
It does so because the physical laws are
different for different sized animals.

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,058
Life spans seven orders of magnitude,
from invisible bacteria to mites, ants,

20
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,869
mice, dogs, humans, elephants and, blue
whales. Every size lives in its own

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,669
unique universe right next to each other,
each with its own rules, upsides, and

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,399
downsides. We'll explore these different
worlds in a series of videos. Let's get

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,609
back to the initial question: Why did our
mouse survive the fall? Because of how

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,658
scaling size changes everything; a principle that we'll meet over and

25
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,579
over again. Very small things, for example,
are practically immune to falling from

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,999
great heights because the smaller you
are the less you care about the effect

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,039
of gravity.
Imagine a theoretical spherical animal

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,779
the size of a marble. It has three
features: its length, its surface area,

29
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,699
(which is covered in skin) and its volume,
or all the stuff inside it like organs,

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,489
muscles, hopes and dreams. If we make it
ten times longer, say the size of a

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,169
basketball, the rest of its features
don't just grow ten times. Its skin will

32
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:01,249
grow 100 times and it's inside (so it's
volume) grows by 1000 times. The volume

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,379
determines the weight, or more accurately,
mass of the animal. The more mass you

34
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,559
have, the higher your kinetic energy
before you hit the ground and the

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,179
stronger the impact shock. The more
surface area in relation to your volume

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,589
or mass you have, the more the impact
gets distributed and softened, and also

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,179
the more air resistance will slow you
down. An elephant is so big that it has

38
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,589
extremely little surface area in ratio
to its volume. So a lot of kinetic energy

39
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,609
gets distributed over a small space and
the air doesn't slow it down much at all.

40
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,259
That's why it's completely destroyed in
an impressive explosion of goo when it

41
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,359
hits the ground. The other extreme,
insects, have a huge surface area in

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,929
relation to their tiny mass so you can
literally throw an ant from an airplane

43
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,969
and it will not be seriously harmed. But
while falling is irrelevant in the small

44
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,629
world there are other forces for the
harmless for us but extremely dangerous

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,939
for small beings. Like surface tension
which turns water into a potentially

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,189
deadly substance for insects. How does it
work? Water has the tendency to stick to

47
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,119
itself; its molecules are attracted to
each other through a force called

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,169
cohesion which creates a tension on its
surface that you can imagine as a sort

49
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,179
of invisible skin. For us this skin is so
weak that we don't even notice it

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,189
normally. If you get wet about 800 grams
of water or about one percent of your

51
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,809
body weight sticks to you. A wet mouse
has about 3 grams of water sticking to

52
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,849
it, which is more than 10% of its body
weight. Imagine having eight full water

53
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,259
bottle sticking to you when you leave
the shower. But for an insect the force

54
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,339
of water surface tension is so strong
that getting wet is a question of life

55
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,479
and death.
If we were to shrink you to the size of

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,709
an ant and you touch water it would be
like you were reaching into glue. It

57
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,429
would quickly engulf you, its surface
tension too hard for you to break and

58
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,119
you'd drown. So insects evolved to be water
repellent. For one their exoskeleton is

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,769
covered with a thin layer of wax just
like a car. This makes their surface at

60
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,749
least partly water repellent because it
can't stick to it very well. Many insects

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,639
are also covered with tiny hairs that
serve as a barrier. They vastly increase

62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,179
their surface area and prevent the
droplets from touching their exoskeleton

63
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,737
and make it easier to get rid of
droplets. To make use of surface tension

64
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:26,289
evolution cracked nanotechnology
billions of years before us. Some insects

65
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,219
have evolved a surface covered by a
short and extremely dense coat of water

66
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,769
repelling hair. Some have more than a
million hairs per square millimeter when

67
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,119
the insect dives under water air stays
inside their fur and forms a coat of air.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,349
Water can't enter it because their hairs are
too tiny to break its surface tension.

69
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,779
But it gets even better, as the oxygen of
the air bubble runs out, new oxygen

70
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,869
diffuses into the bubble from the water
around, it while the carbon dioxide

71
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,389
diffuses outwards into the water. And so
the insect carries its own outside lung

72
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,859
around and can basically breathe
underwater thanks to surface tension.

73
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,279
This is the same principle that enables
pond skaters to walk on water by the way,

74
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,729
tiny anti-water hairs. The smaller you get
the weirder the environment becomes. At

75
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,769
some point even air becomes more and
more solid. Let's now zoom down to the

76
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,039
smallest insects known, about half the size
of a grain of salt,

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,579
only 0.15 millimeters long: the Fairy Fly.
They live in a world even weirder than

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,649
another insects. For them air itself
is like thin jello, a syrup-like mass

79
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,329
surrounding them at all times.
Movement through it is not easy. Flying

80
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,289
on this level is not like elegant
gliding; they have to kind of grab and

81
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,509
hold onto air. So their wings look like
big hairy arms rather than proper insect

82
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,339
wings. They literally swim through the
air, like a tiny gross alien through

83
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,099
syrup.
Things only become stranger from here on

84
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,779
as we explore more diversity of
different sizes. The physical rules are

85
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,559
so different for each size that
evolution had to engineer around them

86
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,899
over and over as life grew in size in
the last billion years. So why are there

87
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,959
no ants the size of horses?
Why are no elephants the size of amoeba? Why?

88
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,339
We'll discuss this in the next part.
