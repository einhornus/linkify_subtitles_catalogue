1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,239
Over the last few years,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,349
organic food has spread like wildfire.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,152
Despite higher prices,

4
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:10,329
buying organic is turning from an alternative

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,689
into a moral and social responsibility.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,069
Organic food is supposedly healthier

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,949
more natural and more ethical.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,969
But what do we even mean when we say organic?

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,779
There's no global consensus,

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,299
so different regions have different definitions and rules.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,239
In general,

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,289
organic food is farmed without GMO seeds,

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,659
synthetic fertilizers,

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,671
or synthetic pesticides.

15
00:00:35,672 --> 00:00:36,623
Instead,

16
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:39,879
organic farmers use more traditional ways of producing food,

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,139
like crop rotation,

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,139
and use organic fertilizers

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,619
such as compost or manure.

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,054
While the motivation to buy organic food is clearly noble,

21
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:50,589
is it actually effective

22
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,596
or just another costly trend we can skip

23
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:58,629
without feeling guilty?

24
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,939
[Music]

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,489
Is organic food healthier?

26
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,969
One idea associated with organic crops

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,719
is that their natural cultivation

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,038
is supposed to make them more nutritious and healthier.

29
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,909
Indeed,

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,999
several studies found that organic foods contain more antioxidants.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,416
Plants produce them as a sort of homemade pesticide.

32
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,359
Organic plants seem to have to work a little harder,

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,879
while regular plants have plenty of help from humans.

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,989
Antioxidants are believed to have some health benefits,

35
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,549
although scientists are still on the fence about them in general.

36
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,096
We have no idea if and how exactly they help us,

37
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:44,569
or how much produce you'd have to eat to absorb a certain amount.

38
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,789
What about organic being more nutritious?

39
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,207
Well, the evidence is mixed.

40
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,289
Some studies found

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,119
that organic food can have slightly higher concentrations of vitamin C,

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,009
and omega-3 fatty acids,

43
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,819
while others did not find significant differences.

44
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,659
Overall, the mixed evidence

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,509
suggests that there are only small differences in nutritional value.

46
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,978
So, from the science available so far,

47
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,830
it doesn't look like organic food has significant health benefits.

48
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,999
What we do know,

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,129
is that eating fruit and veggies in general is good for you,

50
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,959
and most of us don't do that enough.

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,909
Eating veggies is more important for your health

52
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,979
than how they were produced.

53
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,149
Is organic food more natural?

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,169
People don't only buy organic to get extra vitamins,

55
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,249
but to avoid something toxic;

56
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,569
artificial pesticides and fertilizers.

57
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,489
And indeed several studies show

58
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,152
that there actually is less pesticide residue on organic produce.

59
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:48,119
But here's where things get complicated.

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,729
Less pesticide does not mean none at all.

61
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,169
While pesticides are supposed to be a last resort in organic farming,

62
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,879
they're not forbidden.

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,669
Most organic pesticides are natural toxins,

64
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,919
like vegetable oils,

65
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,947
hot ash soap,

66
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,949
sulfur or copper sulfates.

67
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,319
But there are synthetic substances as well.

68
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,219
What's the difference between organic and regular pesticides?

69
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,840
Not a lot actually.

70
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,159
Organic pesticides

71
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,709
are not necessarily safer than conventional ones.

72
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,459
Toxic is toxic.

73
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,739
No matter if the substance is manufactured,

74
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,465
or derived from nature.

75
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:25,339
In fact,

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,029
in the case of copper sulfate,

77
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,099
often used on organic apples,

78
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,899
the organic pesticide of choice

79
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,709
is actually more harmful to humans.

80
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,629
The toxicity of any substance

81
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,359
depends on its concentration

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,109
and your exposure to it --

83
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,819
not if it's natural or not.

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,419
There are a few recent studies

85
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,189
about how our current level of pesticide exposure

86
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,519
affects our long-term health.

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,439
The 2018 study from France

88
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,639
associated never eating organic food

89
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,739
with a higher risk of certain cancers.

90
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,519
The study was criticized a lot though.

91
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,519
The participants reported their dietary habits themselves,

92
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,059
while no actual tests of pesticide levels in their bodies were done.

93
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,759
Complicating things even more,

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,499
a Danish study from 2018

95
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,959
found that the danger from pesticides for an adult

96
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,489
was similar to drinking a glass of wine every three months.

97
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,319
The pesticides on your vegetables

98
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,889
are nothing to lose sleep over.

99
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,749
Despite this,

100
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,569
we should continue to demand strict standards for our food.

101
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,099
All pesticides are regulated and tested very strictly

102
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,143
in the EU and the US.

103
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:30,929
Every year,

104
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,769
thousands of food samples are screened for pesticides.

105
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,529
The majority of samples have no residues

106
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,539
or just a fraction of the tolerance level.

107
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,519
Right now,

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,009
contamination from bacteria and fungi

109
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,489
is much more dangerous.

110
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,939
And, on this front,

111
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,239
the risk is the same --

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,599
be it organic or regular food.

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,659
Is organic food better for the environment?

114
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,029
In 2017, a meta-analysis

115
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,019
looked at organic farming in detail

116
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,719
and analyzed organic and regular foods

117
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,629
from over 700 production sources,

118
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,749
and their impact on categories like greenhouse gas emissions,

119
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,779
energy consumption,

120
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,719
and land needs.

121
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,679
The result?

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,559
No production method is clearly better for the environment.

123
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,899
Organic systems use less energy than conventional ones,

124
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,819
but have similar greenhouse gas emissions.

125
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,269
Organic farms use less pesticide,

126
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,299
but need much more land to produce the same amount of crop.

127
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,869
These mixed results were also confirmed

128
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,619
by a report from the Swedish food agency.

129
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,341
Organic and regular were equal in most regards.

130
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:39,279
The biggest difference was land use.

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,832
And here conventional farming clearly won,

132
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,609
and ecotoxicity

133
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,169
where organic farming has a clear advantage.

134
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,959
So, according to these results,

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,239
conventional farming

136
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,159
actually has a little bit less impact on the environment

137
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,219
compared to organic.

138
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,519
The bottom line is

139
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,719
organic food isn't superior to regular produce

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,397
as far as we know.

141
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:05,416
But, organic agriculture also has an impact at a broader level.

142
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,539
Demand is rising constantly,

143
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,329
and the struggle to supply the market

144
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,222
can lead to production methods that are less sustainable in other ways.

145
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:14,529
Spain, for example,

146
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,249
grows tons of regular and organic vegetables

147
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,429
destined for export

148
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,439
in vast greenhouse areas which use a lot of energy.

149
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,629
And have other environmental impacts,

150
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,969
such as significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions.

151
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,629
And, because growing demand can't be covered by domestic production,

152
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,539
the global trade and organic foods is also increasing.

153
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,119
As supply chains get more and more complex,

154
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,338
to make all kinds of foods available in organic quality,

155
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,659
ensuring organic quality standards

156
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,909
and regulations gets ever more difficult.

157
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,489
This has led to incidences of fraud

158
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,119
where conventional food was labeled and sold

159
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,829
as expensive organic produce.

160
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,429
But, organic versus conventional food

161
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,559
isn't even an objective discussion.

162
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,399
Organic is not simply a production method.

163
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,536
For many, it's an ideology.

164
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:08,699
Buying organic feels right.

165
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,819
People want to do the correct thing for the health of their children,

166
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,969
and the well-being of the planet.

167
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,029
But, our instinct to think of organic as good,

168
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,377
and conventional as bad,

169
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:23,469
can get in the way of making the most reasonable decision.

170
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,039
The solution could be to stop seeing organic

171
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,905
and conventional farming as irreconcilable.

172
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,889
They both have pros and cons,

173
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,719
and the best way to produce healthy food efficiently

174
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,919
would be a combination of their best features.

175
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,599
And,

176
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,549
as for your personal shopping,

177
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,139
what food you should buy

178
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,707
depends on what you expect from it.

179
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,218
If you simply want to eat healthily,

180
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,749
you should buy more fruit and vegies of any kind,

181
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,169
not necessarily organic.

182
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,249
If your concern is for the environment,

183
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,519
then simply buying organic won't solve this problem for you.

184
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,749
The easiest option,

185
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,799
is to buy local food that's in season.

186
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,729
Basically,

187
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,569
seasonal is the true organic.

188
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,550
To sum up,

189
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:09,309
an organic label is a manufacturing notice,

190
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,369
not a security certificate

191
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,069
or a silver bullet for your diet.

192
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,189
What you eat

193
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,779
is much more important than how its produced.

194
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,659
Production is very important for our animations though.

195
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,619
We make them with a lot of love and care,

196
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,719
and the best thing is

197
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,899
you can learn how to do them.

198
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,919
