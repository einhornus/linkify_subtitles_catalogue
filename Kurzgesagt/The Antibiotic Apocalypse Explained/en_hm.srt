1
00:00:00,205 --> 00:00:03,523
What would you say if we told you
that humanity is currently making

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:07,355
a collaborative effort to
engineer the perfect superbug?

3
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:10,627
A bug that could kill hundreds
of millions of people?

4
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:13,620
Well, it is happening right now.

5
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:26,206
We are in the process
of creating a superbacterium.

6
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:29,612
Bacteria are among the oldest
living things on this planet.

7
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,204
The smallest thing we still consider life,
they are masters of survival

8
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:35,673
and can be found everywhere.

9
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:37,851
Most bacteria are harmless to us.

10
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:41,807
Your body hosts trillions of them,
and they help you to survive.

11
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,769
But others can invade your body,
spread quickly, and kill you.

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,315
Millions of people used to die as a result
of bacterial infections.

13
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:53,049
Until we developed
a superweapon—antibiotics.

14
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,351
Together with vaccinations, antibiotics
revolutionized medicine

15
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:58,773
and saved millions of lives.

16
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:02,855
Antibiotics kill the vast majority of
susceptible bacteria fairly quickly,

17
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,756
leaving only a small group of survivors

18
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:07,667
that our immune system
then deals with easily.

19
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,957
How do antibiotics do this?

20
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,547
Imagine a bacterium as
a very complex machine

21
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:17,364
with thousands of complex processes
going on that keep it alive and active.

22
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:19,851
Antibiotics disrupt
this complex machinery,

23
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:22,486
for example, by
interfering with its metabolism,

24
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:26,694
slowing down their growth significantly,
so they are less of a threat.

25
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:30,275
Other antibiotics attack DNA
and prevent it from being replicated,

26
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:34,083
which stops bacteria from multiplying,
ultimately killing them.

27
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:37,382
Or by simply ripping the outer layer
of the bacteria to shreds,

28
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:40,689
so that their insides spill
out and they die quickly.

29
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,941
All of this without bothering body cells.

30
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:48,075
But now, evolution is making
things more complicated.

31
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:52,452
By pure random chance, a small minority
of the bacteria invading your body

32
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:55,533
might have evolved a way
to protect themselves.

33
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,790
For example, by intercepting
the antibiotics

34
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,874
and changing the molecule
so it becomes harmless.

35
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:04,416
Or by investing energy in pumps
that eject the antibiotics

36
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,690
before they can do damage.

37
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,079
A few immune bacteria
are not that big a deal,

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,986
because the immune system
can take care of them.

39
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:15,792
But if they escape, they
might spread their immunity.

40
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:18,246
How can bacteria spread immunity?

41
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:20,999
First of all, bacteria
have two kinds of DNA:

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,369
the chromosome and small
free-floating parts called plasmids.

43
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,243
They can hug each other
and exchange those plasmids

44
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:30,815
to exchange useful abilities.

45
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:34,394
This way, immunity can be
spread quickly through a population.

46
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:38,263
Or, in a process called transformation,
bacteria can harvest dead bacteria

47
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:40,585
and collect DNA pieces.

48
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:43,120
This even works between
different bacteria species

49
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:48,953
and can lead to superbugs, bacteria
that are immune to multiple antibiotics.

50
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:52,242
A variety of superbugs
already exist in the world.

51
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:55,840
Especially hospitals are the
perfect breeding grounds for them.

52
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:58,234
Humans have short memories.

53
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:01,730
The horrors of the pre-antibiotic
era have been forgotten.

54
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:04,651
Today, we treat this powerful medicine
as a commodity

55
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:09,102
instead of as the game-changing
achievement of science that it is.

56
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:11,057
This has led to a strange disconnect:

57
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,672
hundreds of millions of people
still don’t have access

58
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:15,788
to antibiotics in developing countries,

59
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:19,679
while in other parts of the world
antibiotics are prescribed too freely

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,887
and taken without care.

61
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:24,266
Antibiotics should be a last-resort drug,

62
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:27,712
not something you take
because your cold is annoying.

63
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:32,203
Another serious problem is
antibiotic use in meat production.

64
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:34,763
At any particular point in time,
humanity holds

65
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:38,419
between 20 and 30 billion
animals as livestock.

66
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,932
To make meat cheaper, many animals
are held in horrible conditions,

67
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:45,306
in very tight spaces, and
in unhygienic conditions,

68
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:49,061
the perfect breeding ground for disease.

69
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,932
So many animals are given antibiotics
to kill as many bacteria as possible

70
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,938
and prevent them from getting sick.

71
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,610
Because a cheeseburger
has to cost a dollar.

72
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:59,928
Unsurprisingly, as a
result of this system,

73
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,116
we have created
more and more bacteria

74
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,804
that are resistant to antibiotics.

75
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:07,231
To counteract this, we
use different antibiotics

76
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:11,707
and we have another secret weapon:
there are specific antibiotics

77
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:15,083
that are used to wipe out bacteria
that have developed resistance.

78
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:20,213
There are strict rules for using these
to avoid the creation of a superbacterium.

79
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,260
Or so we thought.

80
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:26,009
In late 2015, scary news
arrived from China.

81
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,151
Resistance against Colistin,
a last-ditch antibiotic,

82
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,620
had been discovered.

83
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:34,719
Colistin is an old drug and was rarely
used, because it can damage the liver.

84
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,888
So there was little resistance against it,
which made it a great

85
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,453
antibiotic of last resort for certain
complex infections that occur in hospitals

86
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:46,650
to fight bacteria that have become immune
to a whole bunch of other drugs.

87
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:50,823
Bacteria resistance to Colistin
is very, very bad news.

88
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:55,682
It might destroy a last line of defense
and lead to a whole lot of dead people.

89
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,250
How could this happen?

90
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:01,124
Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms
have been given Colistin for years.

91
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,351
Resistant bacteria developed, spreading
first from animal to animal,

92
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:07,259
and then to humans without being noticed.

93
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,927
On an average day, there are
over 100,000 flights on Earth,

94
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:14,023
kind of connecting every
human on the planet.

95
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:17,496
By creating the modern world,
we have also built the infrastructure

96
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,790
for a dangerous pandemic.

97
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,252
Still, we don’t need to panic just yet.

98
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:26,798
Bacteria evolve, humans do research,
new antibiotics are developed

99
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:31,326
as old ones become obsolete,
technology is advancing every day.

100
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:35,162
The problem is real and serious,
but the fight is far from over.

101
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:38,838
If humanity plays its cards right,
superbugs might turn out to be

102
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,661
not very super after all.
