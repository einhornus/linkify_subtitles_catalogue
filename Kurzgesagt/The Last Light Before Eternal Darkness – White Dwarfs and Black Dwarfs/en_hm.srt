1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,839
Humans can survive in this universe as long as we have an energy source.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,319
Unfortunately, the universe will die. It will happen slowly, over many billions of years,

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,739
but it will happen. On a universal time scale, stars like our sun will be gone in no time.

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,119
Luckily, there are places that will exist practically forever from a human perspective:

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,479
the corpses of dead stars...

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,259
white dwarfs.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,119
They could be humanity's last home right before the death of the universe.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:49,279
What are these strange things and what happens when they finally die?

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,139
How long stars live varies drastically,

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,339
depending on how massive they are.

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:02,759
For example, really massive stars burn hot and fast, dying violently in supernovae a few million years after birth.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,779
But they're the exception.

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,619
97% of all stars will end their existence as white dwarfs.

14
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,979
There are two ways this can happen:

15
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:20,139
Small stars - so-called red dwarfs - burn out over trillions of years until they eventually quietly turn into white dwarfs.

16
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,399
Medium-sized stars like our Sun are more interesting.

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,399
Imagine the sun as a huge pressure cooker that fuses hydrogen into helium in its core through its gravity.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,619
The fusion of elements releases extreme amounts of energy,

19
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,659
that pushes outwards and stabilizes the star, keeping it in a delicate balance.

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,179
When the Sun is old, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted,

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,999
and the Sun will begin to burn helium into heavier elements.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,479
While doing so, it will shed its outer layers.

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,079
When this process is over more than half of the Sun's mass will be lost into space as a spectacular

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,459
planetary nebula millions of kilometers across.

25
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,639
What remains will be its former core:

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,179
A white dwarf is born, a star corpse.

27
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,899
While its former self was about 100 times its diameter, now

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,599
it's only about as big as Earth, but still with about half of its former mass.

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,639
This means it's extremely dense, a teaspoon of white dwarf is about as massive as a car.

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,499
Its surface gravity is over 100,000 times higher than Earth's.

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,139
If you tried to land on it, you'd immediately be compressed into a steaming puddle.

32
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,359
Life around a white dwarf is very unlikely, but possible.

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,299
Most of them that exist now were former stars that, well, died, which probably ruined any planets they once had.

34
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,599
But that's not all: since they are so small,

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,019
a planet would need to orbit them about 75 times closer than Earth is to the Sun to have liquid water.

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,599
This proximity has up- and downsides:

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,499
for one, it would tidally lock the planet giving it a permanent day and permanent night.

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,859
At the edges of these day and night zones life could be possible.

39
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,599
But white dwarfs have a very stable energy output,

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,099
so they might actually be safer to live around than many red dwarfs.

41
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,019
This is still speculation at this point,

42
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,739
but if we could find the white dwarf with the right conditions to settle around,

43
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,539
we could have a home for many billions of years.

44
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,639
But why do they shine so much longer than other star types?

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,279
White dwarfs are very, very hot - up to 40 times hotter than our Sun -

46
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,019
ranking among the hottest objects in the universe.

47
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,359
But they are not incredibly active.

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,359
All the heat inside of them is trapped and has nowhere to go.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,619
Only on its outer layer can it escape into space.

50
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,659
But space is mostly empty, so heat can't be transferred by conduction.

51
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,379
The only way energy can escape is by radiation.

52
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,119
This is so inefficient that white dwarfs will take trillions of years to cool down,

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,659
which may make them humanity's last refuge.

54
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,119
They might be the last sources of light and energy in a dying universe.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,879
According to some estimates white dwarfs might shine as long as 100 billion billion years,

56
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:20,099
ten billion times longer than the universe has existed. So far into the future that no regular stars will shine any more,

57
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,379
galaxies will have evaporated, and

58
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,239
only then will the first white dwarf turn into the first black dwarf.

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,439
When this happens the last hope for life will die off.

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,879
Black dwarfs will be inactive spheres with no energy left to give,

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,919
still massive enough to kill you if you get too close.

62
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,559
So cold that they'll be near the coldest possible temperature in the universe,

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,899
so dark that they are practically invisible.

64
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:55,019
The universe will enter its last stage - heat death - which will leave the universe unrecognizable,

65
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,339
an absolutely dark and cold graveyard,

66
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,379
with black holes and black dwarfs scattered over trillions of lightyears.

67
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,839
We don't know for sure what will happen with black dwarfs in the end.

68
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,179
If the proton - one of the fundamental parts of atoms - has a limited lifespan,

69
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,919
black dwarfs will slowly evaporate over many trillions of years.

70
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,079
If the proton does not decay,

71
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,179
black dwarfs will probably turn into spheres of pure ion via quantum tunneling, over a timespan

72
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,159
so obscenely gigantic that calling it forever is okay.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,109
These ion spheres will then travel completely alone through a dark universe.

74
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,809
Nothing new will happen anymore...

75
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,038
forever.

76
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:43,719
While this may sound kind of dark, this is so far away that for our purposes today, it might as well not happen at all.

77
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,419
It doesn't matter what happens in a billion trillion years.

78
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,979
Right now, we happen to exist at an excellent time,

79
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,299
able to be in awe about a universe filled with endless stars and light and planets.

80
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,899
And enough time to visit them one day.

81
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,478
Our music is finally available on Spotify and iTunes. it's composed by our good friends at Epic Mountain,

82
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,448
two guys with a studio who make music for a living.

83
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:16,089
You can check them out here, and follow them on Facebook and Twitter. And if you like our videos,

84
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,159
please consider supporting us on Patreon.

85
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,259
It really would be extremely helpful.
