1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,559
Here in the Kurzgesagt labs

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,470
we only work on

3
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,843
the most important scientific problems like

4
00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:07,407
"What if we nuke stuff"

5
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,350
or "how about

6
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:09,976
we make this elephant explode"

7
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:10,390
 or

8
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:11,590
who could forget

9
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:12,550
"look at this thing.

10
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:14,332
It's really big."

11
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,350
Continuing this proud tradition,

12
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,563
let's explore the scientific mystery of what

13
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:19,719
would happen to you,

14
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,519
if Earth suddenly turned into gold!

15
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,665
The “Midaspocalypse”,

16
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,145
based on the ancient tale of King Midas

17
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:27,043
who was cursed

18
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:28,416
so everything he touched

19
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,292
 turned into gold

20
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:31,972
Before we can explore this scenario

21
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:32,803
with science,

22
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,979
we'll first define the premise.

23
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,919
Midas's curse is a very special phenomenon,

24
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,390
called magic,

25
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,781
which allows us to modify physics.

26
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:43,830
So what happens when midas touches

27
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,979
something and it turns to gold?

28
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:53,659
[Music]

29
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,834
An atom of gold has 79 protons and 118 neutrons
in its nucleus

30
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:02,176
The electric force of the protons on the
electrons around them

31
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:03,203
shapes the atom

32
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:05,309
and gives gold its chemical properties,

33
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,785
like that it doesn't rust,

34
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:08,750
and that it's kind of shiny and bendy.

35
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:11,363
So, to make not-gold into gold,

36
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:13,429
we have to change atoms.

37
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,763
Let's say Midas touches a duck.

38
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:17,661
All the light elements like hydrogen,

39
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,492
carbon, and oxygen

40
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,821
 gain electrons and protons and neutrons

41
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:23,239
 to become gold.

42
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,350
Not only is the duck

43
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,643
 suddenly 33 times more massive

44
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:28,923
it's also much too dense.

45
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:30,265
The gold atoms are far

46
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,861
closer together than they like

47
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:33,470
and repel each other violently

48
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:35,527
causing the golden duck to explode with

49
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,759
the energy of half a ton of TNT,

50
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,283
leaving only gold dust

51
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:40,923
and a very dead Midas.

52
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:42,750
This is clearly not a very good way for

53
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,736
Midas' power to work.

54
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,372
So what if instead

55
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,879
Midas' power uses the

56
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,741
atoms that are already present

57
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,243
and simply rearranges all particles in

58
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:54,763
the matter he touches, into gold.

59
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:57,012
No matter is created or destroyed,

60
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:59,363
instead atoms dissolve and the protons,

61
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:01,892
neutrons, and electrons are reassembled

62
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:03,399
to make gold

63
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,581
 however gold is very dense,

64
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:08,692
about 20 times denser than a duck.

65
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,246
Without adding any matter

66
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:10,939
the gold duck

67
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,439
would be a very awkward kind of foamy gold

68
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,089
with lots of tiny microscopic gaps,

69
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,603
this is funky and doesn't explode,

70
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,083
which is progress.

71
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:21,871
Now that we've established a sort of

72
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:23,439
magic that works,

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,539
what would happen if Midas stumbles,

74
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,777
what if he touches Earth itself?

75
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:31,801
Let's freeze time for just a moment,

76
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:32,850
and rearrange

77
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,267
all the matter in the Earth.

78
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:35,377
 Just like the duck,

79
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:37,213
the Earth is now solid gold,

80
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:40,329
but with many tiny atomic-scale gaps.

81
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,015
While these gaps weren't a huge deal for the duck,

82
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:45,161
they're a big problem for the Earth.

83
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:48,036
A spongy planet is not a thing that can exist,

84
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,914
as gravity compresses Earth,

85
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:52,700
squeezing it together to close up the gaps.

86
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:53,391
As a result,

87
00:02:53,392 --> 00:02:54,846
the Earth contracts,

88
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:57,726
shrinking to two-thirds of its radius.

89
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,603
If you're standing on Earth's surface,

90
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:02,107
you'll suddenly find yourself in free fall,

91
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:03,462
like on a roller coaster,

92
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:06,196
as the ground sinks away beneath you.

93
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:08,149
But since the ground is falling too,

94
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,622
it doesn't move away from you,

95
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,999
it feels like someone turned off gravity

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
and you and everything else would begin to float

97
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,434
but the ride doesn't last forever,

98
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:19,439
it takes only 10 minutes for everything to

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,441
crash down,

100
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:23,311
and a weird 10 minutes it is indeed.

101
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:24,107
And then,

102
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,744
as abruptly as it started,

103
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:26,874
it stops.

104
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,580
The collapsing earth has reached
its desired size

105
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:32,441
and gravity is suddenly turned back on for you.

106
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,742
Hopefully you enjoyed your minutes of floating

107
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:36,596
because the ground and you with it

108
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:37,754
crash into the planet

109
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:39,693
at 30,000 kilometers an hour,

110
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:42,163
making your body spatter like a water balloon

111
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:43,283
as it hits.

112
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:45,071
In one instant basically all

113
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:48,196
of humanity gets smashed into red puddles.

114
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:50,422
This is only the start of our problems though,

115
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:53,514
since Earth imploded supersonically.

116
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:55,914
the kinetic energy of the implosion is basically 

117
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,733
equivalent to detonating a planet made of TNT.

118
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:01,424
Crushed together under incredible forces,

119
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:02,209
Earth's core

120
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,359
reaches a million degrees celsius

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,279
a temperature closer to the core of a star

122
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,636
than anything we're used to finding on Earth.

123
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:11,947
As the earth 'crashes into itself'

124
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:14,643
it generates an enormously powerful shockwave

125
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:15,989
which plows upwards,

126
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,057
catapulting the atmosphere up and off.

127
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,587
The earth’s surface temperature

128
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:22,742
reaches hundreds of thousands of degrees,

129
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:25,773
and everything on it is instantly vaporized

130
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:29,034
to a fluffy plasma cloud that starts to expand,

131
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,690
but not by much

132
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:32,615
many of the atoms that may have been new

133
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:34,187
you get mixed into this cloud,

134
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:38,149
while others boil off, escaping from the atmosphere.

135
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,671
The golden plasma outshines the sun

136
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:42,756
while the enormous radiation lifts tons

137
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:45,279
of material off into space.

138
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,394
Over the coming days

139
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:47,899
the plasma cloud cools,

140
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,909
and eventually freezes into a shiny

141
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,886
little golden ball.

142
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:52,719
Okay,

143
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,528
maybe this type of magic doesn't work

144
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,507
so if replacing atoms made the Earth so

145
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,380
over dense that it exploded

146
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:02,897
and disassembling and reassembling atoms

147
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:05,768
made the earth so under dense that it imploded,

148
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:09,274
 there must be a sweet spot where the
Earth does neither

149
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,819
what if Midas power is such that an object

150
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,799
is suddenly replaced by an object

151
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,260
with the same volume

152
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,227
made from solid gold.

153
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:19,779
That magic is a little bit more magic,

154
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,664
and cuts a few extra corners

155
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:24,140
but let's see where this leads us

156
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,439
so Midas stumbles again,

157
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,544
Even though our new

158
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:30,530
pure gold Earth is not expanding or

159
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,471
contracting,

160
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:34,121
it's suddenly much more massive.

161
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:35,420
The density of gold

162
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:38,431
is three and a half times greater than the earth,

163
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:39,321
meaning the earth

164
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:42,667
is going to get three and a
half times more massive!

165
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:43,655
For starters,

166
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:45,222
everyone now has to contend

167
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,300
with surface gravity

168
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,836
that is more than three times stronger,

169
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,169
so if you're not a champion weightlifter

170
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,624
who's used to carrying around a few

171
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,455
times your body weight on your shoulders,

172
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:56,450
you're probably going to be slammed to

173
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:59,109
the ground by your own weight.

174
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,464
Depending on where you were

175
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:01,876
when earth turned into gold,

176
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:04,991
this alone could seriously hurt or even kill you.

177
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:07,199
Trees and artificial structures collapse

178
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,486
under stress they were never meant to sustain

179
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:11,246
while birds and planes and all things

180
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,954
that were able to fly or float

181
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,008
splash to the ground all around you.

182
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,954
And you’re not the only thing weighed
down by the greater gravity. 

183
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:20,173
The weight of the atmosphere,

184
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:21,782
and also atmospheric pressure,

185
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:23,175
nearly quadruples,

186
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,335
which is a bad thing if you like living.

187
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:27,184
On its own, this won’t kill you

188
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:29,090
scuba divers can comfortably breathe

189
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,861
air at these pressures for a while, 

190
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,363
but unfortunately squeezing the

191
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,016
atmosphere this much raises its

192
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:36,585
temperature to 150 degrees Celsius,

193
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:39,074
which is like the insides of an oven.

194
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:41,179
The entire earth's surface bakes,

195
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,314
roasting anything and everything.

196
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,812
There is no escape. 

197
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:46,914
Gold may be a metal

198
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:49,154
but it is about three times weaker than steel,

199
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,754
and also very malleable,

200
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:53,394
which makes it very bad mountains material

201
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:57,696
 the tallest mountains that can be supported
are now only about two kilometers high.

202
00:06:57,697 --> 00:06:59,261
so whole ranges compress

203
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:02,505
as their own weight basically
crushes their base.

204
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,759
it's hard to say what happens here

205
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,616
We're probably in for giant
earthquakes and landslides

206
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:10,230
as the planet is squeezed into a new shape.

207
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,919
And it's not just mountain ranges

208
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,625
the differences between the continents

209
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,332
and the ocean floor level out,

210
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,549
causing the ocean basins to overflow,

211
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,483
sending massive tidal waves over the

212
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:20,985
Earth's surface.

213
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:23,794
What remains is a planet made from gold,

214
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:26,861
entirely covered by an ocean 3 kilometers deep,

215
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,470
a super hot atmosphere

216
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:32,176
and a lot of dead people.

217
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,447
Hmm ok,

218
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:35,652
there may be a lesson to take away here

219
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:38,007
but we're not sure what it is!

220
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,239
We did all the maths though,

221
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,179
it's in our sources document if you want
to take a look.

222
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,079
If you learned anything in this video 

223
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,834
let us know what it was.

224
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:49,789
So as you might know, the things we sell in our shop

225
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,665
are the reason we're able
to publish videos for free

226
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,772
but it's way more than that for us.

227
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,089
Here's a short story

228
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,705
and a making of...

229
00:07:57,706 --> 00:07:59,181
A while ago we posted

230
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:00,976
this image on social media,

231
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:03,243
just to post something nice looking,

232
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:05,243
immediately a lot of people were quite

233
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:06,249
upset about it

234
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,341
because it was wrong

235
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:10,799
and you guys take what we put out that seriously

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,203
so we've deleted it

237
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:16,159
and contacted experts to make
something new and better.

238
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,339
We spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration

239
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,767
and created this new extensive map of evolution,

240
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:27,229
a new visualization of the relationships
between living things

241
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,145
that didn't exist before.

242
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:32,639
And while this was obviously a lot of work and stress

243
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,495
it sort of exemplifies why working on
this channel is so satisfying

244
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,825
because you people care,

245
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,065
and this makes us work harder

246
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,714
and learn things we didn't know before.

247
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:44,354
So,

248
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:46,719
thank you for supporting our crazy ideas,

249
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,510
and our sometimes crazy merch.

250
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:53,789
because of you we can continue to release
our videos for free for everyone

251
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,261
and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts.

252
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:59,510
We are super grateful for that!

253
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:01,643
You can check out the new evolution poster,

254
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:04,292
among many other things made with love

255
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,440
