You can order the limited edition...

00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,654
...for the short time of 10 days and then never again.

4
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:10,394
Its like a regular calendar for 2018 but with one important difference.

5
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:15,554
Its for the year 12,018 of the human era.

6
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:21,314
We explained why this should be our current calendar in our A new calendar for humanity video.

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:24,224
Last years calendar got a lot of feedback and we've listened...

8
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,974
...to what you wanted.

9
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,894
The 12,018 calendar has much more room for notes.

10
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:32,774
A spiral binding, we got the shipping costs down.

11
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,474
And it will arrive for time in Christmas.

12
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,714

13
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:38,384
has a gold cover,

14
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,434
and It was produced in Seattle, so we can ensure Kurzgesagt quality.

15
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:43,184
 

16
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:46,154

17
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:48,594

...until October the 20th.

20
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:56,724
The human era calendar is a passion project for us.

21
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:59,464
That represents the idea of human unity and progress.

22
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:02,924
And that we need to work together to stay alive and to travel to the stars.

23
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,693
 

24
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:09,164
Its the second time we've made one and we're trying to make this a regular thing.

25
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:12,534
Thanks a lot to everyone who loves the idea of a new history.

26
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:23,099
We couldn't do any of this without this group of like-minded humans around the world.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,360
