1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,539
Imagine if you could gather the energy from every star within a hundred million light years.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,379
From thousands of galaxies, each with billions of stars.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:16,139
Imagine, you could take this kind of power, and use it to fire the biggest super-weapon in the universe.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,819
Imagine the damage you could do.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,199
It turns out, you don't need to imagine it.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,919
These exist, and they're called gamma ray bursts.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,419
But what are these cosmic snipers?

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:40,939
And what happens if one takes a shot at Earth?

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,759
To understand gamma ray bursts, we first have to understand gamma rays.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,259
Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation â€“ waves which carry energy just like visible light.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,279
Visible light is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum: it's the part your eyes can see.

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,199
At lower energies, there are radio waves, microwaves and infrared.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,939
And at higher energies: ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,939
Gamma rays are incredibly powerful.

15
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,879
A single gamma ray photon, is more energetic than a million visible photons combined.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,739
Their high energy makes gamma rays a form of ionizing radiation.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,519
Meaning they are energetic enough, to break apart atomic bonds.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,599
This makes them dangerous to you and me.

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,899
Ionizing radiation disrupts the delicate biochemical machinery that keeps us alive,

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,519
like a 9mm bullet through a clock.

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,359
Fortunately, on Earth, the ozone layer blocks gamma rays. Filtering them out before they can harm us.

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,219
But if the atmosphere blocks gamma rays from space,

23
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,799
how were gamma ray bursts (or GRBs) from space ever discovered?

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,259
During the Cold War,

25
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:57,159
the USA sent up spy satellites, which could detect gamma rays from Soviet nuclear tests in space.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,959
They didn't see any bombs, but they did observe faint bursts coming from space,

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,959
lasting only a few seconds.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,479
To date, this may be the only major scientific discovery made by spy satellites (that we know about anyway).

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,879
Astronomers use telescopes see different kinds of light to make their discoveries.

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,859
And these spy satellites gave them a new pair of eyes.

31
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,779
They were a mystery for thirty years but eventually,

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,359
we discovered the source of a GRB: a galaxy six billion light years away.

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,179
If a GRB can be seen from such a distance, then it must be incredibly energetic.

34
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,999
Releasing more energy in a second than the sun will, in its entire ten billion year lifetime.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,479
Making GRBs, the brightest events in the universe.

36
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,899
So, where do they come from?

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,499
GRBs, accompany some of the most violent, cataclysmic deaths in the universe,

38
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,199
and the birth of black holes.

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,299
There are two types of gamma ray bursts:

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,179
short and long, and each has their own source.

41
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,939
Long GRBs last about a minute, and scientist think they are produced by supernova:

42
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,399
when the core of a massive star collapses to become a black hole.

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,519
Short GRBs last a second, and are produced when two neutron stars in a binary merge.

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,079
Over millions of years, their orbits decay by emmiting gravitational waves.

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,699
Once they are close enough to touch, they crash and splash into each other, forming a black hole.

46
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,159
Both supernova and neutron star mergers the same thing:

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,719
black holes, surrounded by a magnetized disc of gas left over from their parent stars.

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,139
In these environments, the rotation winds up the magnetic field, which funnels hot jets of particles,

49
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,499
traveling at nearly the speed of light.

50
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,619
The gas in this funnel creates two tight jets of high energy gamma rays,

51
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,459
like a celestial laser gun.

52
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,079
So unlike other cosmic explosions, which spread out and fade,

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,199
GRBs say focused, and can been seen from much further.

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,439
Any more detail would require too much mathematics for a YouTube video.

55
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,279
The universe is full of these cosmic snipers, firing blindly and randomly into the dark,

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,639
and they're hitting us all the time.

57
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,139
On average, we detect one per day. Fortunately, most are harmless.

58
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,259
All the bursts we have detected so far, originated outside the Milky Way,

59
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,819
too far away to hurt us.

60
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,299
But a nearby GRB could be disastrous,

61
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,779
if one goes off within a few light years of us, it would totally cook the surface of the Earth.

62
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,519
Or at least, the half that's facing it.

63
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,799
But even a more distant GRB could still end life on Earth.

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,799
And it wouldn't need to score a head-shot to kill us.

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,339
If originating from a few thousand light years away,

66
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,159
it would be a hundred light years wide by the time it reaches us,

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,999
washing over the Solar System like a tidal wave.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,999
Again, the ozone layer protects us, but it's better equipped to handle the trickle of ultraviolet from the sun.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,999
A gamma ray burst would overwhelm it, leaving us exposed to deadly solar radiation.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,619
Ozone takes years to replenish itself by natural processes,

71
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,019
which is more than enough time for the sun to burn the Earth sterile.

72
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,599
Or at least, to kill most complex life.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,559
In fact, this may have already happened.

74
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,359
A GRB has been suggested as one possible cause of the Ordovician extinction 450 million years ago,

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,859
that eradicated almost 85% of all marine species.

76
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,799
Although it's pretty much impossible to prove.

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,779
Gamma ray bursts could even be one reason we don't see life anywhere else in the universe.

78
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,559
They might be wiping clean huge chucks of it, on a regular basis.

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,439
It's been suggested, that because of GRBs, only 10% of all galaxies might be hospitable to life,

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,439
similar to us.

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,959
So, are they going to kill us?

82
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,439
Probably not.

83
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,639
In a galaxy like ours, there may only be one GRB per millennia.

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,279
And to harm us, they must be close and directed at us.

85
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,799
But since gamma rays travel at the speed of light, we won't know when it's headed our way until it arrives.

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,039
So, there could already be a GRB on its way to kill us all, and we won't know it, until it hits us,

87
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
and we're dead.
