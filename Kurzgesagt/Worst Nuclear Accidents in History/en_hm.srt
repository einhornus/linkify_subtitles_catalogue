1
00:00:01,483 --> 00:00:05,466
Nuclear energy creates an uneasy
feeling of danger for many people.

2
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:07,999
Ancient and dangerous minerals 
are concentrated

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,449
to awaken seemingly unnatural powers,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,499
creating horribly toxic elements

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,299
that if they escape,
can and have killed people

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,966
in horrible ways.

7
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:20,416
How many people has 
nuclear energy killed and how?

8
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:27,699
♪ Intro music ♪

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,966
Nuclear energy has been 
a thing since 1951

10
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:35,599
and since then, there have been 
around 30 reported accidents globally.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,499
Most of them were 
pretty minor compared to

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,732
the two disasters everybody 
is familiar with:

13
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,082
Fukushima and Chernobyl.

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,416
Chernobyl is undoubtedly the worst 
nuclear accident in history

15
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,399
for a number of reasons.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,916
The reactor technology was old 
and ill-prepared for emergencies

17
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,599
and the government response was slow

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,382
and more concerned about 
image than damage control.

19
00:00:56,383 --> 00:01:00,616
Still, only 31 people died
directly in the accident.

20
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:04,499
But what makes nuclear energy scary 
is not reactors blowing up

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,949
but the radiation they release.

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,132
So the real question is

23
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,682
how many deaths through 
cancer and other diseases

24
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:12,816
will Chernobyl cause?

25
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:16,882
Here, things get really complicated
because you dip right into controversy

26
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:20,549
and just discussing the different 
estimates and how they were calculated

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,666
deserves a video of its own.

28
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,899
The most pessimistic estimate
comes from a study

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,882
commissioned by the 
European Green Party

30
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:32,082
and projects up to 60,000 
premature deaths by the year 2065.

31
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:36,449
Most scientific studies come up with 
numbers much lower than this.

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,149
The WHO has estimated that in total

33
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,849
the long term death toll 
will be around 4,000.

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,332
While the UN Scientific Committee on 
the Effects of Atomic Radiation

35
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,299
concluded that even this figure 
could be too high.

36
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,249
For more details on this,
check our research document.

37
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,116
The second big nuclear accident 
was Fukushima Daiichi in 2011.

38
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,149
Fukushima did not only operate 
with much better technology,

39
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,482
that was less dangerous 
in the first place,

40
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:05,832
much better security measures 
were in place

41
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,099
and the official response 
was fast and decisive.

42
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,249
And so the current death toll is only 573.

43
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,766
The major difference here is that

44
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,666
these deaths were not a 
consequence of radiation.

45
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,582
They were indirect deaths from 
the stress of the evacuation

46
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,632
of the areas around the reactors

47
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:26,382
and occurred almost entirely 
in older populations.

48
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:30,449
Estimates of the possible long-term 
deaths from radiation vary widely,

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,282
from none at all to about 1,000.

50
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,732
In terms of the other 
long-term consequences,

51
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,916
an increase in thyroid cancer 
in children has been observed,

52
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:44,199
but according to the WHO this is related 
to the increased screening rates.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,966
By 2018 there had been only one 
confirmed death among workers

54
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,666
as a result of radiation 
induced lung cancer.

55
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:55,616
Now let's compare this 
to renewable energy.

56
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:59,782
Solar, wind and geothermal energy 
basically only cause deaths

57
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:03,399
as a result of construction 
and maintenance accidents.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,849
Unfortunately, their current share 
of global energy is pretty low.

59
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,949
The major player in renewable 
energy is hydropower,

60
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,582
which mostly means building dams and 
letting water flow through turbines

61
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,966
from a higher elevation 
to a lower elevation.

62
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:21,849
In total, hydro has been the most 
fatal in terms of accidents

63
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,999
with hundreds of thousands of 
deaths in the last half century.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,049
One accident clearly stands out,

65
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,016
the 1975 Banqiao hydroelectric dam 
failure in china,

66
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:34,932
which has striking 
similarities to Chernobyl.

67
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:38,066
Old technology, poor design 
and poor management

68
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:41,999
by authoritarian governments 
concerned about appearances.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,732
In a nutshell, a massive typhoon 
triggered intense flooding

70
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:48,432
that destroyed the dam 
and subsequently

71
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:51,049
a number of smaller dams 
in a chain reaction,

72
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,566
unleashing a flood of over 15 billion 
cubic meters of water in total.

73
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,916
Kilometre wide waves 
as high as buildings

74
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:00,966
devastated thousands of square 
kilometres of countryside

75
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:02,999
and countless communities.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,699
All in all, the death toll 
from just this one accident

77
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,332
and its direct consequences

78
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:12,582
is estimated to lie between 
85,000 to 240,000.

79
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,131
But all of these deaths caused by 
nuclear and renewable energy

80
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:20,482
are actually negligible in comparison to 
the real killer energy source:

81
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:26,066
fossil fuel, the most widely used 
source of energy and electricity.

82
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:29,666
When we burn fossil fuels to heat up 
water and make turbines spin,

83
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:33,599
or to cause mini explosions to move 
cars with internal combustion engines,

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,499
gases like ozone, sulfur dioxide, 
carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide

85
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,816
are released into the atmosphere.

86
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:43,299
Breathing in these gases 
disrupts lung function,

87
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,582
which aggravates chronic conditions 
like asthma and bronchitis

88
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:51,366
and causes a wide range of respiratory 
and cardiovascular diseases

89
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:54,282
but even more dangerous 
is the fine particle pollution

90
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:56,332
burning fossil fuels causes.

91
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,132
A mixture of solid and liquid droplets 
of poisonous substances

92
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,182
as small as 2.5 microns in diameter.

93
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:05,766
They easily find their way 
deep into your lungs

94
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,782
and increase the risk 
of deadly diseases

95
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:11,332
like lung cancer, 
stroke and heart disease.

96
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,582
Fossil fuel related air pollution
is the number one cause of

97
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,666
environmental related 
deaths in the world.

98
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:22,749
According to the WHO, it accounts for 
29% of all cases of lung cancer,

99
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,466
17% of deaths from acute 
lower respiratory infection,

100
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:30,716
24% from stroke, 25% from 
ischemic heart disease

101
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:35,166
and 43% from chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease.

102
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,499
All in all, outside air pollution adds up

103
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,882
to the deaths of 4 million 
people each year.

104
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,466
What makes air pollution especially
problematic and sinister

105
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:48,016
is the fact that the damage 
it causes happens very gradually,

106
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:52,832
which makes it hard for our brains that
didn't evolve with subtle dangers in mind

107
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,499
to realise the scope of the problem.

108
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,082
Collectively, air pollution from 
fossil fuels is estimated to have killed

109
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:05,149
around 100 million people 
in the past 50 years.

110
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,032
But wait, is that really fair?

111
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,666
Fossil fuels also provide 
over 80% of global energy

112
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,482
so it makes sense that 
they cause the most deaths.

113
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:18,399
So let's compare deaths per energy unit.

114
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,399
Deaths per energy unit produced.

115
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,782
A few studies have compared the death 
rates from different energy sources

116
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:26,966
per one terawatt hour.

117
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:31,566
That's about the annual energy 
consumption of 27,000 EU citizens

118
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:35,082
or 12,600 US citizens.

119
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:39,116
To produce that much energy for 
one year, coal causes 25 deaths

120
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:42,882
oil causes 18 and natural gas 3.

121
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:46,382
Renewable energy causes 
one death every few decades.

122
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:48,582
And nuclear, in the worst case,

123
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,682
nuclear energy would cause 
one death every 14 years.

124
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:56,816
One study even found that nuclear 
energy actually saved 2 million lives

125
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,482
between 1971 and 2009

126
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:03,566
by displacing fossil fuels 
from the global energy mix.

127
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:07,649
The numbers are clear, even when 
using wildly pessimistic numbers

128
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,499
nuclear energy is among the 
safest forms of energy generation

129
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,416
and at a time when we're struggling 
to slow down rapid climate change

130
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,232
it's a really valuable low-carbon option.

131
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,416
However, all these facts still 
leave one major argument

132
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,899
that is fielded against 
nuclear power.

133
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,582
Opponents of nuclear energy 
argue that nuclear waste

134
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,182
and it's lack of long-term 
storage solutions

135
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:32,149
is an unacceptable problem and risk,

136
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,882
while proponents of nuclear energy
say that until renewable energies

137
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:39,166
are able to cover the complete 
energy demands of mankind,

138
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,599
it's arguably safer to store 
nuclear waste for the time being

139
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,382
than to inhale poisonous gases 
and promote rapid climate change.

140
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,932
But a detailed discussion about 
nuclear waste would go too far here,

141
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,916
more about it in our sources.

142
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:56,949
Let us know if you'd like 
a whole video about it.

143
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,282
So looking at the comparative 
death rates, it's a bit concerning

144
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:04,266
that some countries are replacing 
nuclear energy with fossil fuels,

145
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,949
mostly coal.

146
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,566
Especially Germany and Japan 
have been the most active

147
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:11,266
in dismantling their nuclear fleet.

148
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,016
In a ploy to appease the public,

149
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:16,782
the German government shut down 
11 of its 17 nuclear facilities

150
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:20,799
and plans to close the 
remaining reactors in 2022.

151
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,066
The immediate gap in energy production

152
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:26,116
was filled by temporarily 
increasing coal production,

153
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:28,699
the energy source with the 
largest health impacts

154
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,816
and the worst consequences 
for climate change.

155
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:35,199
A 2019 analysis concluded 
that as a consequence,

156
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,081
the nuclear phase-out has led to

157
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:40,599
1,100 avoidable deaths 
per year in Germany

158
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,399
due to the increased air pollution 
in the years after 2010.

159
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,899
So, in conclusion, nuclear energy feels 
way more dangerous than it actually is.

160
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,466
No matter how you look at it,

161
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,766
the one thing we should strive to 
get rid of as quickly as possible

162
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,166
are fossil fuels to prevent the 
deaths they cause each year

163
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:01,116
and to slow down climate change.

164
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:05,032
Regardless of how much you personally 
care about climate change issues

165
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,299
or which energy source you favour,

166
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,166
saving millions of lives should be 
something we can all agree on.

167
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,632
Maybe you've actually made 
some kind of resolution

168
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,199
to try and be more sustainable this year.

169
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,316
Or maybe your goals are 
more about you as a person

170
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:23,832
and you'd like to pick up 
some new skills.

171
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:29,532
Still being stuck mostly inside is the 
perfect time to work on that plan.

172
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:32,899
We've partnered with Skillshare, 
an online learning community

173
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,649
that offers thousands of 
classes for all skill levels

174
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:41,466
in tons of creative skills like 
illustration, animation or film and video.

175
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:44,682
But you could also dive into 
classes about productivity,

176
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,366
growing houseplants 
or interior design.

177
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:50,432
All perfect for making your 
time at home more enjoyable

178
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,132
and learning something new.

179
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,582
You get unlimited access to all classes
for less than ten dollars a month

180
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,516
with an annual premium membership.

181
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,682
And the first one thousand 
Kurzgesagt viewers

182
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,532
to click the link in the description 
will get a free trial.

183
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,649
And if you can't decide 
which class to take,

184
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,999
maybe get started with 
something super practical

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,199
like learning how to best approach 
your creative process.

186
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,999
We liked Productivity for Creatives:

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,499
Build a System That Brings Out 
Your Best by Thomas Frank

188
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,516
but whatever makes you feel good and 
gives you new ideas is worth a try.

189
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:24,816
If you want to get creative with new
skills and support Kurzgesagt,

190
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:25,650
give it a go.
