1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,699
There are probably 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on Earth, in the observable universe.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,219
We know that there might be trillions of planets.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,209
So where are all the aliens?

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,419
This is the Fermi Paradox.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,333
If you want to know more about it, watch part one.

6
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:19,297
Here we look at possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox.

7
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:29,786
So will we be destroyed or does a glorious future await us?

8
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:35,721
Space travel is hard. Although possible, it's an enormous challenge to travel to other stars.

9
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:39,959
Massive amounts of materials have to be put into orbit and assembled.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,208
A journey of maybe thousands of years needs to be survived by a population big enough to start from scratch.

11
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:50,477
And the planet might be not as hospitable as it seems from afar.

12
00:00:50,478 --> 00:00:54,505
It was already extremely hard to set up a spaceship that could survive the trip.

13
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:58,535
An interstellar invasion might be impossible to pull off.

14
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:02,638
Also, consider time: the Universe is very old.

15
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:06,684
On Earth there's been life for at least 3.6 billion years.

16
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:10,746
Intelligent human life for about 250,000 years.

17
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:15,683
But only for about a century have we had the technology to communicate over great distances.

18
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:20,799
There might have been grand alien empires that stretched across thousands of systems

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,399
and existed for millions of years and we might just have missed them.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,287
There might be grandiose ruins rotting away on distant worlds.

21
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:33,630
99% of all species on Earth have died out.

22
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,406
It's easy to argue that this will be our fate sooner or later.

23
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:44,336
Intelligent life may develop, spread over a few systems and die off, over and over again.

24
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,732
But galactic civilizations might never meet.

25
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:54,032
So maybe it's a unifying experience for life in the Universe to look at the stars and wonder "Where is everyone?"

26
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:57,829
But there is no reason to assume aliens are like us,

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,508
or that our logic applies to them.

28
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,059
It might just be that our means of communication are extremely primitive and outdated.

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,779
Imagine sitting in a house with a Morse code transmitter: you'd keep sending messages

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,899
but nobody would answer, and you would feel pretty lonely.

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,164
Maybe we're still undetectable for intelligent species

32
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:21,737
and we'll remain so until we learn to communicate properly.

33
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:28,112
And even if we met aliens we might be too different to be able to communicate with them in a meaningful way.

34
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:30,465
Imagine the smartest squirrel you can,

35
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:35,252
no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to explain our society to it.

36
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:42,894
After all, from the squirrel's perspective, a tree is all that a sophisticated intelligence like itself needs to survive.

37
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:50,077
So humans cutting down whole forests is madness; but we don't destroy forests because we hate squirrels.

38
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:51,878
We just want the resources.

39
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,762
The squirrel's wishes and the squirrel's survival are of no concern to us.

40
00:02:55,763 --> 00:03:00,902
A Type 3 civilization in need of resources may treat us in a similar way.

41
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:05,191
They might just evaporate our oceans to make collecting whatever they need easier.

42
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:12,791
One of the aliens might think for a second "Oh, tiny little apes! They built really cute concrete structures, oh well now they're dead."

43
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,841
before activating warp speed.

44
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:18,991
But if there is a civilization out there that wants to eliminate other species,

45
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:22,991
it's far more likely that it will be motivated by culture rather than by economics.

46
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:28,901
And anyway it will be more effective to automate the process by constructing the perfect weapon,

47
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:32,901
a self replicating space probe made from nano-machines.

48
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:36,901
They operate on a molecular level: incredibly fast and deadly,

49
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:40,331
with the power to attack and dismantle anything in an instant.

50
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:43,661
You only need to give them four instructions.

51
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:45,671
One, find a planet with life.

52
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:49,481
Two, disassemble everything on this planet into its component parts.

53
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:52,831
Three, use the resources to build new space probes.

54
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,041
Four, repeat.

55
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:59,151
A doomsday machine like this could render a galaxy sterile in a few million years.

56
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:03,151
But why would you fly light years to gather resources or commit genocide?

57
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:05,891
The speed of light is actually... not very fast.

58
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:11,381
If someone could travel at the speed of light, it will still take 100,000 years to cross the milky way once,

59
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:13,664
and you'll probably travel way slower.

60
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:19,273
There might be way more enjoyable things than destroying civilizations and building empires.

61
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:22,063
An interesting concept is the Matrioshka Brain.

62
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,369
A mega-structure surrounding a star,

63
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:32,685
a computer of such computing power that an entire species could upload their consciousness and exist in a simulated universe.

64
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:39,845
Potentially, one could experience an eternity of pure ecstasies without ever being bored or sad, a perfect life.

65
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:45,140
If built around a red dwarf, this computer could be powered for up to ten trillion years.

66
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:50,200
Who would want to conquer the galaxy or make contact with other life forms, if this were an option?

67
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,683
All these solutions to the Fermi Paradox have one problem.

68
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,804
We don't know where the borders of technology are.

69
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:59,844
We could be close to the limit or nowhere near it.

70
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:02,347
And super technology awaits us,

71
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:07,878
granting us immortality, transporting us to other galaxies, elevating us to the level of gods.

72
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,731
One thing we do have to acknowledge is that we really don't know anything.

73
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:17,391
Humans have spent more than 90% of their existence as hunter-gatherers.

74
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:20,342
500 years ago we thought we were the center of the universe.

75
00:05:20,343 --> 00:05:24,663
200 years ago we stopped using human labors as the main source of the energy.

76
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:29,866
30 years ago we had apocalyptic weapons pointed at each other because of political disagreements.

77
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,496
In the galactic time scale we are embryos.

78
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:35,597
We've come far, but still have a long way to go.

79
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,387
The mindset that we really are the center of the universe is still strong in humans,

80
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:44,547
so it's easy to make arrogant assumptions about life in the universe.

81
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:51,879
But in the end, there's only one way to find out, right?

82
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,059
Hey, everybody!

83
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,319
We finally have our own subreddit.

84
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,919
Come by for surveys, discussions about future videos,

85
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,299
FAQs, and stuff like that.

86
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,019
This video was made possible by your support on Patreon.

87

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,279
and maybe get your own bird avatar in return,

89
