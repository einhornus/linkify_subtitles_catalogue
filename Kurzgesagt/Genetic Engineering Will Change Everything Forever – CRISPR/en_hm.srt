1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,349
Imagine you were alive back in the
1980's and were told

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,983
the computers would soon
take over everything.

3
00:00:06,984 --> 00:00:10,339
>From shopping to dating
and the stock market.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,529
That billions of people
would be connected via a kind of web.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,469
That you would own a handheld device

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,539
orders of magnitude more powerful
than supercomputers.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,719
It would seem absurd but
then all of it happened.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,259
Science fiction became our reality
that we don't even think about it

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,409
We're at a similar point today with
genetic engineering.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,379
So let's talk about it.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,099
Where it came from?
What we're doing right now?

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,448
And about a recent breakthrough
that will change how we live

13
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:56,029
and what we perceive as "normal" forever.

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,568
Humans have been engineering life for
thousands of years. Through selective breeding

15
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:04,597
we strengthened useful traits
and plants and animals.

16
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:08,278
We became very good at this but
never truly understood how it works.

17
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:13,799
Until we discovered the code of life:
deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA,

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,469
a complex molecule the guide of
the growth, development function

19
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,608
and reproduction of everything alive.

20
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:23,588
Information is encoded in
the structure of the molecule.

21
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:28,229
Four nucleotides are paired
and make up a code that carries instructions.

22
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,248
Change the instructions and you change
the being carrying it.

23
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:35,849
As soon as DNA was
discovered people try to tinker with it.

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,139
In the 1960's, scientists bombarded
plants with radiation

25
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,589
to cause random mutations
in the genetic code.

26
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,789
The idea was to get
a useful plant variation by pure chance.

27
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,619
Sometimes, it actually worked too.

28
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,679
In the 70's, scientists inserted DNA snippets
into bacteria, plants and animals

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,149
to study and modify them for research,
medicine, agriculture and for fun.

30
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,109
The earliest genetically modified animal
was born in 1974,

31
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,787
making mice a standard tool for research,
saving millions of lives.

32
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,429
In the 80's, we got commercial.

33
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,989
first patent was given for a microbe
engineered to absorb oil today we

34
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,829
produce many chemicals by means of
engineered life like life-saving

35
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,119
clotting factors growth hormones and
insulin, all things we had to harvest

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,619
from the organs of animals before that.
The first food modified in the lab went

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,199
on sale in 1994: the Flavr Savr tomato,
a tomato given a much longer shelf life

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,569
where an extra gene that suppresses the
build-up of a rotting enzyme. But GM food

39
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,189
and the controversy surrounding them
deserve a video of their own.

40
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,509
In the 1990's there was also a brief
foray into human engineering. To treat

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,499
maternal infertility, babies were made
to carry genetic information from

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,759
three humans making them the first
humans ever to have three genetic

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,129
parents. Today there are super muscled
pigs, fast-growing salmon, featherless

44
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,839
chickens and see-through frogs. On the
fun side, we made things glow in the dark

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,319
fluorescent zebrafish are available for
as little as ten dollars.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,599
All of this is already very impressive
but until recently,

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,409
gene editing was extremely expensive,
complicated and took a long time to do.

48
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,238
This has now changed with a
revolutionary new technology now

49
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,839
entering the stage: CRISPR. Overnight, the
costs of engineering have shrunk by 99%

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,458
Instead of a year.

51
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,238
it takes a few weeks to conduct
experiments and basically everybody with

52
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,669
a lab can do it. It's hard to get across
how big a technical revolution CRISPR is.

53
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,199
It literally has the potential to
change humanity forever.

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:54,802
Why did this sudden revolution happen
and how does it work?

55
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:59,279
Bacteria and viruses have been fighting
since the dawn of life.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,669
So-called bacteriophages, 
or phages, hunt bacteria.

57
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,069
In the ocean, phages kill 40% of them
every single day.

58
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,169
Phages do this by inserting 
their own genetic code into

59
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,639
the bacteria and taking them over to use
them as factories.

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,559
The bacteria try to resist, 
but fail most of the time

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,559
because their protection tools are too weak.

62
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,509
But sometimes, bacteria survive an attack.
Only if they do so can they activate

63
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,999
their most effective antivirus system.
They save a part of the virus DNA in

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,519
their own genetic code in a DNA archive
called CRISPR.

65
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,089
Here it's stored safely
until it's needed.

66
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,819
When the virus attacks again,
the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy

67
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,259
from the DNA archive and arms a
secret weapon, a protein called Cas9.

68
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,259
The protein now scans the bacterium's
inside for signs of the virus invader by

69
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,299
comparing every bit of DNA it finds to
the sample from the archive.

70
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,369
When it finds a 100-percent perfect match

71
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,869
it's activated and cuts out the virus DNA
making it useless, protecting the

72
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,759
bacterium against the attack.

73
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,269
What's special is that Cas9 is very
precise, almost like a DNA surgeon.

74
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,399
The revolution began when scientists figured
out that the CRISPR system is programmable.

75
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,149
You can just give it a copy
of DNA you want to modify and put the

76
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,409
system into a living cell. If the old
techniques of genetic manipulation were

77
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,779
like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system.
Aside from being precise cheap and easy,

78
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,519
CRISPR offers the ability to
edit life cells to switch genes on and

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,361
off and target and study particular DNA
sequences.

80
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:43,419
It also works for every type
of cell: microorganisms, plants

81
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,689
animals or humans. But despite the
revolution CRISPR is for science,

82
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,407
it's still just a first generation tool.
More precise tools are already being

83
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:59,742
created and used as we speak.

84
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:05,169
In 2015, scientists use CRISPR to cut the HIV
virus out of living cells from patients

85
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,209
in the lab, proving that it was possible.
Only about a year later they carried out

86
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,169
a larger scale project with rats that
had the HIV virus in basically all of

87
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,669
their body cells. By simply injecting
CRISPR into the rats tails, they were

88
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,899
able to remove more than 50%
of the virus from cells all over the body.

89
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,569
In a few decades, a CRISPR therapy
might cure HIV and other retroviruses.

90
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,279
Viruses that hide inside human DNA like
herpes could be eradicated this way.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,999
CRISPR could also defeat one of our
worst enemies: cancer. Cancer occurs when

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,359
cells refused to die and keep
multiplying while concealing themselves

93
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,979
from the immune system. CRISPR gives us
the means to edit your immune cells and

94
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,419
make them better cancer hunters. Getting
rid of cancer might eventually mean

95
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,989
getting just a couple of injections of a
few thousand of your own cells that have

96
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,659
been engineered in the lab to heal you
for good.

97
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,369
The first clinical trial for a CRISPR
cancer treatment on human patients was

98
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,959
approved in early 2016 in the
US. Not even a month later, Chinese

99
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,899
scientists announced that they would
treat lung cancer patients with immune

100
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,929
cells modified by CRISPR in August 2016.
Things are picking up pace quickly.

101
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,249
And then there are genetic diseases. There
are thousands of them and they range,

102
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,289
from merely annoying to deadly or entail
decades of suffering. With a powerful

103
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:32,109
tool like CRISPR, we may be able to end
this. Over 3,000 genetic diseases are

104
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,979
caused by a single incorrect letter in
your DNA.

105
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,699
We are already building a modified
version of Cas9 that is made to

106
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,499
change just a single letter, fixing the
disease in the cell. In a decade or two

107
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,119
we could possibly cure thousands of
diseases forever. But all of these

108
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,799
medical applications have one thing in
common: they are limited to the

109
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,849
individual and die with them, except if
you use them on reproductive cells or

110
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,699
very early embryos. But CRISPR can and
probably will be used for much more:

111
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,379
the creation of modified humans, designer
babies and will mean gradual but

112
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:16,949
irreversible changes to the human gene
pool.

113
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,759
The means to edit the genome of a

114
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,919
human embryo already exists, though the
technology is still in its early stages.

115
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,399
But it has already been attempted twice:
in 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientists

116
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,629
experimented with human embryos and were
partially successful on their second

117
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,589
attempt. They showed the enormous
challenges we still face in gene editing

118
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,699
embryos but also that scientists are
working on solving them.

119
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,959
This is like the computer in the
seventies: there will be better computers.

120
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,539
Regardless of your personal take on
genetic engineering, it will affect you.

121
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,949
Modified humans could alter the genome
of our entire species because their

122
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,309
engineered traits will be passed on to
that children and could spread over

123
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,229
generations slowly modifying the whole
gene pool of humanity. It will start

124
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,729
slowly: the first designer babies will
not be overly designed, it's most likely

125
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,539
that they will be created to eliminate
deadly genetic disease running a family.

126
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,369
As the technology progresses and gets
more refined, more and more people may argue

127
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,499
that not using genetic modification is
unethical, because it condemns children

128
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,719
to preventable suffering and death and
denies them to cure. But as soon as the

129
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,859
first engineered kid is born, a door is
opened that can't be closed anymore.

130
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,289
Early on, vanity traits will mostly be
left alone, but as genetic modification

131
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,219
becomes more accepted and our knowledge
of our genetic code enhances,

132
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,928
the temptation will grow.

133
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,898
If you make your offspring
immune to Alzheimer, why not also

134
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,448
give them an enhanced metabolism?

135
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:55,878
Why not throw in perfect eyesight? How
about height or muscular structure?

136
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,278
Full hair? How about giving your child the gift of
extraordinary intelligence? Huge changes

137
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,938
are made as a result of the personal
decisions of millions of individuals

138
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:10,969
that accumulate. This is a slippery slope.
Modified humans could become the new

139
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,858
standard, but as engineering becomes more
normal and our knowledge improves, we

140
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:21,229
could solve the single biggest mortality
risk factor: aging. Two-thirds of the

141
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:27,138
150,000 people who die today will die
of age-related causes. Currently we think

142
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:31,698
aging is caused by the accumulation of
damage to ourselves, like DNA breaks and

143
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:36,789
the system's responsible for fixing
those wearing off over time. But there

144
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,918
are also genes that directly affect
aging. A combination of genetic

145
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:45,708
engineering and other therapy could stop
or slow down aging, maybe even reverse it.

146
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,238
We know from nature that there are
animals immune to aging. Maybe we could

147
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,789
even borrow a few genes for ourselves.
Some scientists even think biological

148
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,378
aging could be something that eventually
just stops being a thing. We would still

149
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:04,818
die at some point, but instead of doing
so in hospitals at age 90

150
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:09,138
we might be able to spend a few thousand
years with our loved ones. Research into

151
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,808
this is in its infancy, and many
scientists are rightly skeptical about

152
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:19,128
the end of aging. The challenges are
enormous, and maybe it is unachievable.

153
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:24,558
But it is conceivable that people alive
today might be the first to profit from

154
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,889
effective anti aging therapy. All we
might need is for someone to convince a

155
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,389
smart billionaire to make it their next
problem to solve. On a bigger scale we

156
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,328
certainly could solve many problems by
having a modified population. Engineered

157
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:42,108
humans might be better equipped to cope
with high-energy food, eliminating many

158
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:44,799
diseases of civilization like obesity.

159
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,458
In possession of a modified immune
system with a library of potential

160
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:53,059
threat, we might become immune to most
diseases that haunt us today.

161
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,829
Even further into the future we could
engineer humans to be equipped for

162
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,849
extended space travel and to cope with
different conditions on other planet,

163
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:11,511
which would be extremely helpful in
keeping us alive in our hostile universe.

164
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:17,447
Still a few major challenges await us.
Some technological, some ethical.

165
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:21,639
Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and
fear that we will create a world in

166
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,659
which we will reject non-perfect humans
and preselect features and qualities

167
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,969
based on our idea of what's healthy.

168
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,919
The thing is we are already living in
this world. Tests for dozens of genetic

169
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,519
diseases or complications have become
standard for pregnant women

170
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,439
in much of the world.

171
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,359
Often, the mere suspicion of a genetic
defect can lead to the end of pregnancy.

172
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,119
Take Down Syndrome for example: one of
the most common genetic defects.

173
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,689
In Europe, about ninety percent of all
pregnancies where it's detected are

174
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,639
terminated. The decision to terminate
pregnancy is incredibly personal, but

175
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,789
it's important to acknowledge the
reality that we are preselecting humans

176
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,169
based on medical conditions. There is
also no use in pretending this will

177
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,129
change, so we have to act carefully and
respectfully as we advance the

178
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,599
technology and can make more and more
selections. But none of this will happen

179
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,859
soon: as powerful as CRISPR is, and it
is, it's not infallible yet. Wrong edit

180
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,969
still happen as well as unknown errors
that could occur anywhere in the DNA and

181
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,259
might go unnoticed. The gene edit might
achieve the desired result

182
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,389
disabling a disease, but also might
accidentally trigger unwanted changes.

183
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,199
We just don't know enough yet about the
complex interplay of our genes to avoid

184
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,479
unpredictable consequences. Working on
accuracy and monitoring methods is a

185
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,949
major concern as the first human trials
begin. And since we've discussed a

186
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,919
possible positive future, there are
darker visions too.

187
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,699
Imagine what a state like North Korea
could do if they embraced genetic

188
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,739
engineering. Could a state cement its
rule forever by forcing gene editing on

189
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,809
their subjects? What would stop a
totalitarian regime from engineering an

190
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:11,479
army of modified super soldiers? It is
doable in theory? Scenarios like this one

191
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,099
are far far off into the future, if they
ever become possible at all. But the

192
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,789
basic proof of concept for genetic
engineering like this already exists

193
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,888
today. The technology really is that
powerful. One of this might be a tempting

194
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:28,729
reason to ban genetic editing and
related research that would certainly

195
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,409
be a mistake.

196
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,189
Banning human genetic engineering would
only lead to the science wandering off

197
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,499
to a place with jurisdiction and rules
that we are uncomfortable with. Only by

198
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,648
participating can we make sure that
further research is guided by caution,

199
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:50,142
reason, oversight and transparency.

200
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:52,909
Do you feel uncomfortable now?
Most of us have

201
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,109
something wrong with them. In the future
that lies ahead of us, would we have been

202
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,789
allowed to exist?

203
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,889
The technology is certainly a bit scary,
but we have a lot to gain and genetic

204
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,338
engineering might just be a step in the
natural evolution of intelligent

205
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:13,219
species in the universe. We might end
disease, we could extend our life

206
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,989
expectancy by centuries and travel to
the stars. There's no need to think small

207
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,849
when it comes to this topic.

208
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,689
Whatever your opinion on genetic
engineering, the future is approaching no

209
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:29,119
matter what. What has been insane science
fiction is about to become our new

210
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,679
reality, a reality full of opportunities
and challenges.
