1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,199
Is there a border we will never cross? 
Are there places we will never reach,  

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,239
no matter how hard we try? It turns out, 
there are. Even with sci-fi technology,  

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,359
we are trapped in a limited pocket of the Universe  

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:31,039
and the finite stuff within it. How much 
universe is there for us and how far can we go?

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,119
If you look at the night sky, you 
might assume it will be there forever.  

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,039
Stars are born and die again in a cycle that 
feels endless. But it is not. Take the milky way:  

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,559
Up to 200,000 light years in diameter, 
containing some 100 to 400 BILLION stars.  

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,079
How many stars do you think are born 
here each year? Thousands? Millions?

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:05,039
The answer is around three. Three new stars per 
year. 95% of all the stars that will ever exist in  

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,439
the universe have already been born and we live 
at the tail end of the age of star formation.  

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,679
We are at the beginning of the 
end of the universe as we know it,  

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,679
the formation of new stars 
will continue to slow down.

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,119
But there is more. It turns out the 
universe is rushing away from us.

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,919
The Milky Way is not alone - together with 
the Andromeda galaxy, and more than fifty  

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,679
dwarf galaxies,it forms the Local Group, a 
region of space about ten million light years  

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,679
in diameter. Our galactic neighbourhood. 
Hundreds of galaxy groups like the local  

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,719
group make up the Laniakea Supercluster, which 
itself is only one of a myriad of superclusters.  

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,359
In total there are around two trillion galaxies 
that make up the current observable universe.

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,519
Unfortunately, even if we could travel at light 
speed, around 94% of the galaxies we can see  

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,559
are already unreachable for us forever. Let this 
number sink in for a moment. The simple fact that  

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,839
there is a limit for us, and that there is so much 
universe that a human will never be able to touch,  

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,999
is kind of frightening. Why are all of 
these galaxies out of reach already?

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,439
Well, it all has to do with why there are 
galaxies in the first place: the big bang.

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,839
We are simplifying here, but in a nutshell 
about 10^-36 seconds after the big bang,  

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,519
the young universe was a very small bubble of 
energy. It was not completely uniform though,  

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,519
some parts of it were a tiny, tiny bit denser 
than others, which had massive consequences.  

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,239
In a process called cosmic inflation, 
the observable universe expanded rapidly,  

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,839
from the size of a marble to trillions of 
kilometers, in a trillionth of a second.

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,999
This was so fast that all those tiny differences 
in density were stretched from subatomic distances  

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,439
into galactic distances. Which is why the whole 
universe consists of more and less dense regions.  

31
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,479
Pockets of the universe, filled with a bit 
more stuff than the space around them. After  

32
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,159
that short but powerful inflation ended, gravity 
began trying to pull everything back together.  

33
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,599
Inside the denser pockets gravity emerged 
victorious and so over time, they grew into  

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,479
groups of galaxies, like the one we live in today. 
The Local Group is our pocket of the universe.

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,039
But at the larger scales, outside the 
denser pockets, the expansion of space  

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,919
never stopped. This means that our Local 
Group is surrounded by a lot of stuff,  

37
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,119
but none of those structures and galaxies 
are gravitationally bound to us. The more the  

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,279
universe expands, the larger the distance between 
us and the other gravitational pockets becomes.

39
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,439
Even worse for us the expansion of the universe is 
accelerating. We don't know why this happens so we  

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,559
came up with the concept of dark energy. You can 
imagine it like an invisible effect that speeds up  

41
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,199
the expansion of the universe. We will explain 
these concepts in more detail in another video  

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,799
though, for now all you need to know is that 
the universe is expanding faster and faster!

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,078
This expansion means that there is a cosmological 
horizon around us. Everything beyond it, is  

44
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,919
traveling faster, relative to us, than the speed 
of light. So everything that passes the horizon,  

45
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,279
is irretrievably out of reach forever and we 
will never be able to interact with it again.  

46
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,439
In a sense it's like a black hole’s event 
horizon, but all around us. 94% of the  

47
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,679
galaxies we can see today have already 
passed it and are lost to us forever.  

48
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,719
Wait, if we can’t interact with 
them, how come we can still see them?

49
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,359
Well, the way we are able to see something is 
via light. And although the speed of light is  

50
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,479
the fastest way to travel through the universe, 
it needs time to get from one place to another.  

51
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,839
Every second light reaches us from 
trillions of galaxies that have  

52
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,559
passed the horizon because when their light 
was emitted, they were much closer to us.  

53
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,279
We are looking at their ancient past 
and see their ancient positions.  

54
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,519
So the observable universe is much larger than 
the universe we can actually interact with. In  

55
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,479
a sense, the universe is pulling off a great show 
for us, showing us things that are out of reach  

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,959
forever. We have no idea what these galaxies look 
like today and we will never know. But we will be  

57
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,319
able to observe them for a long time as their 
light hits our telescopes. Interestingly this  

58
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,199
means that currently the observable universe still 
appears to be growing as more and more light,  

59
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,719
released by super distant galaxies billions 
of years ago is arriving at our doorsteps.

60
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,119
Still. All the pockets of the universe outside 
the local group will one day pass our cosmological  

61
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,999
horizon . Once they do, their light won’t be able 
to reach us anymore and from our perspective,  

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,239
they will fade away into darkness. Every second 
of your life 60,000 stars pass the horizon.  

63
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,039
Since you started watching this video around 22 
million stars have moved out of our reach forever.

64
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,999
Ok, but if 94% of the observable universe is 
beyond the cosmic horizon and gone forever,  

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,319
that still leaves us with 6% that is technically 
in reach, which is still a ton of stuff:  

66
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,159
All the galaxy pockets that are less than 18 
billion light-years away. They are still moving  

67
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,199
away, but slow enough that we could physically 
reach them, although chances are shrinking with  

68
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,479
every second that passes. Everything that is 
more than around 5 million light years away  

69
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,319
is moving away from us. But the closest galaxy 
groups are receding the slowest so there is a  

70
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,599
time window to jump galaxy groups. The challenge 
is extreme though even for type 3 civilizations.

71
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,439
Even at the speed of light, a trip to 
the Maffei Group, the closest pocket of  

72
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,319
galaxies outside the local group, would take 11 
million years. If some sort of super motivated,  

73
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,039
super advanced civilization 
takes this challenge on,  

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,839
its potential sphere of influence could 
expand to hundreds or thousands of galaxies.  

75
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,119
Although as time passes and the universe 
grows, they would be separated forever.

76
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,719
It is pretty safe to assume that 
humans will not make this journey,  

77
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,719
at least not with technologies that 
are even remotely on the horizon.  

78
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,999
For us, the Local Group is most likely the 
largest structure that we will ever be a part of.  

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,559
Just traveling between the stars would 
be an achievement of epic proportions.  

80
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,239
We would already be incredibly successful if we 
colonize our cosmic backyard. Which accounts for  

81
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:49,039
0.0 0 0 - 0 0 0 - 0 0 0- 01% 
of the observable universe.

82
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,079
As dark energy pushes the rest of the universe 
away from us the Local Group will become more  

83
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,959
tightly bound. All its galaxies, big and 
small, will merge together to form one  

84
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,959
giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal 
name „Milkdromeda" in a few billion years.  

85
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,599
This process might even smash huge gas clouds 
together and respark star formation for some time!

86
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,439
And this new light will be very welcome because 
at some point, the galaxies outside Milkdromeda  

87
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,919
will be so far away that they become too faint 
to detect. Once this happens, no information  

88
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,799
outside of the Local Group will reach us ever 
again. The universe will recede from view.

89
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,599
A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda 
will think that the universe consists of nothing  

90
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,599
but its own galaxy. When they look far into 
empty space, they will only see more emptiness  

91
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,719
and darkness. They won't see cosmic background 
radiation, and they won't be able to learn about  

92
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,399
the Big Bang. They may have no way of knowing 
what we know today: the nature of the expanding  

93
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,679
universe, when it began, and how it will end. They 
might think the universe is static and eternal.  

94
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,759
Milkdromeda will be an island in the 
darkness, slowly getting darker and darker.

95
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,479
Still, with its trillion stars, the Local 
Group is certainly a big enough playground  

96
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,799
to entertain humanity for a while. After 
all, we still haven't figured out how to  

97
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,519
leave our solar system and we have dozens 
of billions of years at the very least,  

98
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,519
to explore our galaxy. And we have the incredible 
luck to exist at the perfect moment in time  

99
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,479
to see not only our future, but also our most 
distant past, just by looking into the night sky.  

100
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:41,679
As isolated as the Local Group is it is our 
home. And it really is a spectacular place.

101
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,159
Time for some behind the scenes content.

102
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,479
You might have noticed that we sorta already 
made this video a few years ago. But the original  

103
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,279
had a regrettable mistake. In it, we said it 
would be physically impossible to ever leave  

104
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,159
the local group to reach other galaxy groups. 
But our travel limit is actually much larger,  

105
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,559
as we showed in this video. It's not 
physically impossible to go further  

106
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,719
but just extremely unlikely that it’ll ever 
happen. So why did we leave the video up?

107
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,839
Well it has to do with the nature of the 
mistake. We talked to Astrophysicists  

108
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,679
and they thought it didn't matter. 
The parts they considered important  

109
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,079
were correct and they thought 
we should just leave it and move  

110
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,580
on. Which is one of the funny things about working 
with astrophysicists. Rounding up or down a few  

111
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:20,854
billion is not too important to them, as long as 
you’re kind of in the right ballpark, because of  

112
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:23,759
the humongous numbers they work with. So with 
that feedback, we decided to spare the video.

113
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,359
But since 2016, and really thanks to you 
birbs, we were able to grow Kurzgesagt and add  

114
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,919
fact checkers to the team and develop an in 
depth process with experts and our detailed  

115
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,679
sources documents to avoid these sorts of mistakes 
and also to make our work transparent. We can’t  

116
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,319
avoid making mistakes from time to time, 
but we can work hard on getting better.

117
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,079
And this video kept bugging us. So we finally 
decided to replace it, not just reupload,  

118
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,279
but remake it better and longer and add 
fun universe facts to make it worthwhile.  

119
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,039
Sorry for taking so long. We’ll leave the old 
video up but pin a comment and change the title.

120
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,319
If you want to support us and our sometimes 
exhausting but hopefully worthwhile methods,  

121

122
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,399
Inspired by this video’s topic we created a Milky 
Way Poster and a Local Group Poster and we are  

123
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,559
working on a series about the entire universe.
