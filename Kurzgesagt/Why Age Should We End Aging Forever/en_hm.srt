1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,079
If you had to choose right now, how long would you want to live?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,539
80 years? 90?

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,019
120?

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,559
Longer?

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,459
And do you think you'll change your mind once you reach that age?

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,119
Fifty thousand years ago most humans died very young.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,899
As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves, this got better and better.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,939
Today, humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,719
But this has an unforeseen consequence.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,599
We spend an ever-increasing part of our lives being sick and in need of care.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,019
Most of us will die in a hospital bed, which is depressing enough by itself.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,699
But we also have to witness the same happening to our loved ones.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,799
Except, maybe we can stop this forever.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,319
The most effective way to treat a disease is to prevent it.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,159
It saves many more lives if you stop a million people from smoking, than coming up with better chemotherapies.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,279
So why not put a halt to the cause of all disease: the process of aging.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,139
In a nutshell, aging is caused by physics, and not biology.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:19,039
Think of cars. Parts wear down from rubbing and grinding. Metal rusts. Filters get plugged. Rubber cracks.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,939
Our bodies are worn down by trillions of tiny physical processes.

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,199
Oxygen, radiation from the sun, our metabolism.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,999
Our bodies have many mechanisms to repair this damage,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,719
but over time they become less effective.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,239
So our bones and muscles weaken. Our skin wrinkles. Our immune system gets weaker.

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,799
We lose our memory and our senses diminish.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,959
There's no such thing as dying of old age. We all die because one of our important parts breaks.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,059
The older we get, the more damaged and fragile we become until one or multiple diseases take over and kill us.

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,759
Unnoticed by most of us, longevity research has made some unprecedented advances in the last few years.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,138
For the first time, we're starting to understand the mechanisms behind aging and how to manipulate them.

29
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:15,739
Aging is neither mystical nor inevitable, and we might be able to stop or delay it during your lifetime.

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,059
We'll discuss the science behind it and how scientists are trying to stop it in another video.

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:28,159
But first, if we could, should we end aging? Is this a good idea?

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,939
The end of aging or life extension makes many people uncomfortable.

33
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,988
We're born, are young, become older, and then we die.

34
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:43,019
This has been the natural order for literally all of human history, and getting old is a good thing, right?

35
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:49,279
We celebrate the idea of living long enough to experience old age. We even call them the golden years.

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,039
But the reality is that everybody wants to become old, but nobody wants to be old.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,139
Think of the Greek myth of Tithonus for example.

38
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,399
Tithonus was the lover of the goddess Eos and probably an amazing dude,

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,739
because she begged Zeus to grant him immortality, so they could spend eternity together.

40
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,599
But she forgot to specifically ask for eternal youth.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,459
Tithonus was granted eternal life, but he kept aging, unable to die.

42
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:23,119
After a few hundred years, he was reduced to the size of a grape, babbling on senselessly forever.

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,299
Thousands of years ago, humans already feared never-ending old age.

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,599
But ending aging does not mean getting weaker and weaker. If you become too old, it's too late.

45
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,339
A 90 year old who stopped aging would die anyway after a few years.

46
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,179
Too much damage has been done to his internal machinery. There are already too many surfaces for disease to attack.

47
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:51,599
Instead, the concept of life extension promises to end diseases, and with them, the end of a fixed maximum age.

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,939
We don't know how much we could prolong our lives.

49
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,459
We might make every human healthy to the currently accepted maximum age of around 120,

50
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,499
or we might stop biological aging and disease indefinitely.

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,299
Nobody knows at this point what's possible.

52
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,199
Okay, but even if we could achieve that, should we?

53
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,099
Well, life extension is really just another phrase for medicine.

54
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,659
All the doctors are doing is trying to prolong life, and minimize suffering.

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,519
The vast majority of healthcare resources are spent on the consequences of aging.

56
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,559
Nearly half of your lifetime healthcare costs will be spent during your senior years, and another third during middle age.

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,019
We are actually already trying to prolong life with our current medicine. We're just doing it very inefficiently.

58
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,862
Trying to stop aging from happening is not less natural than transplanting a heart,

59
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:46,379
treating cancer with chemotherapy, using antibiotics or vaccines.

60
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,579
Nothing humans do nowadays is purely natural anymore, and we enjoy the highest standard of living ever as a consequence of that.

61
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,559
What we're doing right now is waiting until it's too late and the machine is failing.

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,219
And then we use the vast majority of our resources trying to fix it as well as we can, while it breaks down even further.

63
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,519
But life extension still feels hubristic.

64
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,379
Most people assume that they will want to die once they reach a certain age, and this might still be true.

65
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,199
The idea of avoiding death entirely is off-putting for many.

66
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,639
The end of biological aging would not be in the end of death in any way.

67
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,019
It's more like a summer evening when you were a kid, and your mom called you inside.

68
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,059
You just wanted to keep playing, have a little more fun during sunset before you went to sleep.

69
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,499
It's not about playing outside forever, just a little longer, until we feel tired.

70
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:47,419
If you imagine a world without disease where you and your loved ones could live in good health for another 100 or 200 years, how would this change us?

71
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,479
Would we take better care of our planet if we knew we would be around longer?

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:59,699
If we could work for 150 years, how much time would we spend figuring out what we're good at? How much more time would we spend learning?

73
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:07,119
Would the intense feeling of pressure and stress many of us are feeling right now, go away or get worse?

74
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:16,419
So asking again, if you could choose how long to live right now, in good health and with your friends and family, what's your personal answer?

75
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,119
What would you like your future to look like?

76
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,379
CGP Grey: But maybe you're still unconvinced.

77
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,899
Some nagging feeling remains. That is the Reaper whispering into your brain.

78
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,719
Watch my video to hear what he says, and why you shouldn't listen.

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,519
Your eternal future may depend on it.
