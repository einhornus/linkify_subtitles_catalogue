1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,999
All around the world marijuana is being decriminalized or even made legal

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,219
But is this really a good idea. In the online debate the harmful sites are often downplayed?

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,779
So let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:25,259
 

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,569
Argument number one: In the last few decades

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,079
Marijuana has been engineered to become much more potent

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,779
Today marijuana is so potent that it's actually a strong drug that may cause Psychosis.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:45,359
The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC and there's strong evidence that THC is related to psychosis

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,099
regardless of other risk factors

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,399
Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD that seems to counteract this effect

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,319
It's even being tested as a treatment against psychosis and anxiety

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,699
but because it doesn't make you high growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana over the last few decades while increasing

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,649
THC levels

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:16,299
Sample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:23,039
Shifting the ratio of THC to CBD from 1 to 14 in 1995 to about 1 to 80 in

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,779
2014 it's unclear how precise those tests were. However

17
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:37,019
Overall recent findings suggest that the more marijuana you consume and the stronger it is the higher your risk of developing psychosis

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,879
But how high is the risk of psychosis for the general population?

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,739
a study from britain found that while marijuana use has risen significantly between

20
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,499
1996 and 2005

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,379
the number of schizophrenia cases a type of psychosis remained stable

22
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:01,789
the risk of marijuana induced psychosis remains the highest for people who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with

23
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:09,719
Them, it seems more likely that marijuana speeds up the development of their condition rather than causing it as far as we know right now

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,649
So the reasoning goes if fewer people have access to marijuana the lower the risk of marijuana and juice psychosis

25
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,239
But actually you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegal

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,659
More people will end up with psychosis

27
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,499
prohibition makes

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:33,439
Illegal drug stronger and more potent because this way you can ship more product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profit

29
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,179
this is what happened during the prohibition of alcohol in the US where hard liquor became the norm

30
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,389
and the same is happening with marijuana now

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,109
Imagine a world where liquor is the only alcohol available

32
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,419
You have the choice of either not drinking at all or getting much drunker than you would like to

33
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,229
This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today

34
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:02,009
People didn't stop drinking during Prohibition and the numbers show that laws don't deter people from using marijuana

35
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,049
we can't make marijuana go away, but we can make it safer

36
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:15,329
If marijuana were legal. There would be more options for consumers and regulators could for example insist on a high level of CBD

37
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:24,749
Just like most people don't drink an after-work bottle of vodka many people would gladly consume the after-work beer version of marijuana

38
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:34,349
Argument - marijuana is a gateway drug if it's legalized there will be a spike in the use of much more dangerous drugs a

39
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,689
2015 study found that about

40
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,569
45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other illegal drug at some point

41
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:50,399
Legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend as more young people. Try legal marijuana. They might end up trying harder drugs

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,609
But it turns out that the real gateway to drug use comes much earlier cigarettes

43
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,469
One study showed that teens who started smoking before the age of 15 were 80%

44
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,119
more likely to use illegal drugs than those who didn't and a

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,369
2007 study found that teenagers between 12 and 17 who smoked were three times more likely to binge drink

46
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:21,539
Seven times more likely to have used drugs like heroin or cocaine and were also seven times more likely to resort to marijuana

47
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,899
But if that's the case, how could making more drugs legal stop the use of hard drugs?

48
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,629
At first it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because they're legal or not

49
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,409
If you want to buy any drug, you'll always find someone happy to sell

50
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,469
The real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all?

51
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:51,689
Studies show that certain conditions make people especially vulnerable to drugs and addiction a difficult childhood early trauma

52
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,609
low social status

53
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,459
depression even genetic factors

54
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,759
Which drug they get addicted to is more often than not a matter of chance

55
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:10,259
Addicts take drugs to escape their problems, but drugs don't solve any of those problems and instead become a new problem

56
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:17,429
But punishing people for their unhealthy coping mechanisms doesn't change anything about the underlying causes either

57
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,319
So some argue we need to take a completely different route in

58
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,788
2001 Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe. So it was desperate enough to try something radical

59
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,689
Possession and use of all the legal drugs was decriminalized

60
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,359
He would no longer be arrested instead authorities launched a major health campaign

61
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,839
People who were found with a small amount were referred to support services and got help with treatment and harm reduction

62
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,099
Drug use was seen as a chronic disease not a crime

63
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,179
the results were stunning the number of people who tried drugs and kept using them fell from

64
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,659
44% to 28% by 2012

65
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:06,269
The use of hard drugs decreased as well as HIV and hepatitis infections and overdoses

66
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:13,019
Making drugs legal might overall help society much more than it harms it

67
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,999
Argument number three

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,959
Marijuana is addictive and unhealthy. It needs to remain illegal to keep harm at a minimum

69
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,509
While marijuana addiction is more psychological than physical it is still a real problem

70
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:33,779
the demand for treatment for marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the past decade alone in

71
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,399
Total about 10 percent of people who try marijuana will become addicted

72
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,939
This is also related to higher THC levels a

73
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:49,139
Study released in 2017 tracked the potency of marijuana and Dutch coffee shops over a period of 16 years

74
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,229
For every 1% increase in THC

75
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,469
60 more people enter treatment nationwide in terms of negative health effects

76
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:05,039
Some studies linked marijuana used to increase blood pressure and lung problems while a 2016 study found that marijuana use was

77
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,259
Unrelated to physical health problems except for a higher risk of gum disease

78
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,639
Some studies showed that marijuana use alters teenagers brains and

79
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:23,279
Decreases their intelligence, but when more recent studies took drinking and smoking into account the results were inconclusive

80
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,609
Overall research shows that taking any drugs while the brain is still in development is bad for you

81
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,779
But the truth is we don't know yet how unhealthy marijuana is we need more funding for research?

82
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,029
Which is hard to get while marijuana remains illegal

83
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,719
We can put what we know into perspective though

84
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,099
16% of people who consume alcohol become alcoholics and 32% of people who try cigarettes become smokers

85
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:57,319
We know for sure alcohol affects your brain destroys your liver and causes cancer while tobacco clogs your arteries

86
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,319
Destroys your lungs and also causes cancer

87
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:07,859
3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each year while smoking kills more than 6 million people

88
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,299
Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol are harmless just because they're legal also

89
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,159
Nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them even though they are extremely dangerous

90
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,719
Legality is a way to exercise some control over them, especially when it comes to protecting young people

91
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,089
It's often much harder to buy legal drugs for teenagers than to buy illegal ones

92
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:37,178
Official sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to underage kids

93
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:43,779
Legality creates incentives here that drug dealers can't exploit

94
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:51,099
So making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it it means taking responsibility for the risks it poses

95
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:59,739
It could also open the floodgates to tons of new research that shows us how harmful it really is. And to whom

96
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,509
Conclusion

97
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,289
Marijuana is a drug and just like any other drug

98
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:11,079
It has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it. It is not harmless

99
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:20,499
The best way to protect society from its negative consequences seems to be legalization and regulation
