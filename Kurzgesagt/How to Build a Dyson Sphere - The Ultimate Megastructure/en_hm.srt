1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:08,919
Human history is told by the energy we use. At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,328
We industrialized the world using coal and oil and entered the Atomic Age when we learned how to split a nucleus.

3
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:23,259
At each step, we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species.

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:30,759
Currently, we're slowly transitioning to renewables and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,328
As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat,

6
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,389
we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources.

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,699
At that stage we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into.

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,268
But space is hard and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system will require

9
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:54,189
ungodly amounts of energy.

10
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:00,249
Luckily, we know where to find it. The Sun - the ultimate source of energy.

11
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,618
A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor.

12
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:10,539
It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second.

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:24,769
So, how do we get this energy? Not some of it, all of it.

14
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,689
If we want to collect the most energy physically possible, we'll have to build the largest most

15
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,728
ambitious structure in the universe.

16
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:38,629
The Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output.

17
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:46,368
For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors.

18
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:53,528
The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species. It would usher in an age of exploration and

19
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:56,868
expansion on a scale we can barely imagine.

20
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,629
So, what would it look like?

21
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:07,038
Solid shell enveloping the Sun is probably not the way to go a large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts

22
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,529
possibly shattering it would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the Sun a

23
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:20,169
More, viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson swarm an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power and

24
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,949
beam it elsewhere

25
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:28,729
such as sward would give humanity basically unlimited energy but building it won't be easy

26
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,839
the Sun is very big so we need a lot of satellites if

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,659
Each satellite is a square kilometer we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the Sun

28
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:45,259
even if they're built as lightly as possible we need about 100 quintillion tons of material and

29
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,828
Then we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the Sun on

30
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:57,559
top of all that we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,759
let's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the mega structure

32
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,149
We can sort the challenges into three main categories

33
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,029
materials design and energy

34
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:18,829
To get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson swarm will have to largely disassemble a whole planet

35
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,859
Of the planets available mercury is the best candidate it's the closest to the Sun and very metal-rich

36
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,869
close to the Sun

37
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,319
also

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:35,429
Means less moving stuff around and mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth making it

39
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,579
comparatively easy to launch material into space

40
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,099
Next we should consider the design of our swarm simpler is better

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:51,599
Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short lives our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,019
astronomically long times and they need to be cheap to produce

43
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,099
But they're most likely going to be enormous mirrors

44
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,169
which refocus sunlight to central collecting stations like in concentrated solar power on earth

45
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:12,329
to build and launch them efficiently they must be incredibly light made of little more than polished metal full bound to some supports and

46
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:19,499
Last we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself taking a part of planets and launching things into space

47
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,899
requires an enormous amount of energy for example if we used all the fossil fuels and

48
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,329
Uranium on earth and we?

49
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,239
Were perfectly efficient we could only launch as much

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,119
Mass as Mount Everest into space a rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassembly

51
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,659
To get the energy needed to build a Dyson Sphere it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a dyson sphere

52
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,539
But that's. Ok there's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury so let's get to work

53
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,739
Humans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environment

54
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,979
So, we'd want to automate as much as possible

55
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:02,879
Ideally we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines doing the actual work

56
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,219
There are four major pieces of technology required solar collectors miners refiners and launch equipment

57
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,228
the solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet

58
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:23,089
To start maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them either as mirrors or as traditional solar panels

59
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:30,888
they'll provide the energy to run our miners which strip-mine the surface of the planet and our refiners which extract valuable elements and

60
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,709
fabricate them into our swarm satellites

61
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,179
to get them into space we need a creative and efficient solution

62
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,499
Rockets aren't too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuse

63
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,788
Instead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun a longer

64
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,448
Electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speeds

65
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:56,989
Our swarm satellites will be packed tight for launch unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit

66
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,629
from this point we can take advantage of

67
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:07,999
exponential growth using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury and launch new panels faster and faster

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,668
each panel provides the energy to build another those to work together to build the next to

69
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,809
Four become eight eight become 16 and so on

70
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,299
within just about 60 doubling times the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels and

71
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,538
This can happen quickly if a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build we could be done in a decade

72
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:34,908
if only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energy

73
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:41,778
Even collecting 1% of the sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species energy budget

74
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:49,638
We could create the infrastructure to being basically unlimited amounts of energy around the solar system for all sorts of projects

75
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,968
colonies on other worlds terraforming planets

76
00:06:52,969 --> 00:07:00,408
constructing more mega structures or even traveling to other stars it could be the start of an interstellar

77
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:05,899
Civilization based on physics alone this is not just possible but easy

78
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:13,129
It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet that many astronomers

79
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:20,779
Think there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way we haven't spotted any yet but they could be there

80
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:28,879
it's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains and

81
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,399
Conflicts that will not matter in the long run but if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,939
we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star if

83
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,499
We? Do it the only limitation left will be our own

84
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,489
imagination

85
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,719
We've just hit you with a lot of pretty wild claims and crazy concepts if

86
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,879
You're like us and enjoy using the power of science to determine absurd ways to destroy stuff

87
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,929
you might want to hear how you can come up with something like that yourself

88
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:10,549
Brilliant is a problem-solving website that helps you learn stuff through fun puzzles that split up a complex problem into bite-sized chunks and

89

97
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,659
We love dyson sphere's so much that we've also made a poster about them

98
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,958
it will look pretty on your wall but

99
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,649
