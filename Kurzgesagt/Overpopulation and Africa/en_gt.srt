1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,018
For much of human history, the population grew slowly

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,299
until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,679
In just one century, the population has quadrupled.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,919
This has led to an apocalyptic vision of an overpopulated Earth.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,299
However, the rate of population growth reached its peak in 1960.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,459
Since then, fertility rates have plummeted as countries industrialized and developed.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,474
The world population is currently projected to be

8
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:32,764
around 11 billion people towards the end of the century.

9
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:35,844
But the big picture hides some details.

10
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:38,539
Let's look at one region in particular.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,339
Sub-Saharan Africa.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,899
In 2019 it was home to a billion people, in 46 different countries.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,399
Although its growth rate has slowed in

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,819
recent decades, it is still much higher than the rest of the world.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,579
While some projections suggest the population will reach around 2.6 billion people,

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,259
others say it will be around 5 billion by 2100.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,919
Such growth would be a major challenge for any society.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,199
But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region in the world.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,199
And then sub-Saharan Africa is doomed?

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,619
And why do the projections have a gap of 2.4 billion people?

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,139
As always, it's complicated.

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,119
Sub-Saharan Africa is an artificial concept.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,539
And in many respects even harmful.

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,139
Botswana is as far from Sierra Leone

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,379
as Ireland is from Kazakhstan.

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,239
And they have, more or less, the same in common;

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,204
However, without a bit of generalization,

28
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:34,014
this video would last an hour.

29
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:36,944
We talked to many scientists to make this video

30
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:39,544
and they disagreed on many aspects.

31
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,419
Mainly, on how fertility

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,919
can be correlated with poverty.

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,019
We have done our best to summarize our research and what we have been told,

34
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,879
but take it with a grain of salt, and check our sources

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,904
where the subject is discussed in more detail.

36
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:56,464
Now, let's go back to a global view again.

37
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:59,184
A few decades ago many countries in Asia

38
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,514
were in a similar situation to that of sub-Saharan Africa today: a

39
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:05,634
large part of the population lived in extreme poverty

40
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:07,624
and fertility rates were very high.

41
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,633
For example, in Bangladesh in 1960,

42
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:13,514
an average woman had seven children over the course of her

43
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:16,354
life, 25% of them would die before they could turn five

44
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:19,414
, and of those who survived, only one in five

45
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,204
would learn to read and  write.

46
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:24,339
Life expectancy was around forty-five years,

47
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,159
and per capita GDP was the lowest in the world.

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,219
Thus, in the early 1960s, Bangladesh

49
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,259
initiated a family planning program based on three fundamental pillars:

50
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,199
1. Greater education

51
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,134
helped change the perspective of women;

52
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:41,139
women with a higher level of education tended to have fewer children

53
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,999
and to become mothers at an older age

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,039
2. A quality health care system lowered infant mortality by

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,379
encouraging parents to have fewer children as they would survive.

56
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,324
3. Health workers brought contraceptives to even the most remote areas;

57
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,354
this increased the use of contraceptives,

58
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,864
from 8% in 1975

59
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:02,774
to 76% in 2019.

60
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:05,804
Together, these measures greatly slowed

61
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:07,364
population growth.

62
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:10,364
In 1960, an average Bengali woman

63
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:13,284
had seven children, four in 1995

64
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:16,334
, and only two in 2019.

65
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:19,344
This also changed the demographic profile and the economy:

66
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:22,304
before, many children were born,

67
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:25,054
but they would die before they could contribute to society;

68
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,984
that is until fewer children began to die and be born,

69
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:30,744
then things changed: children could be educated

70
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:33,214
and become productive adults.

71
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:36,279
The government thus had the possibility of diverting part of its resources from reducing infant mortality,

72
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,319
to strengthen the economy.

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,279
By 2024, Bangladesh is expected to

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,134
be promoted from the underdeveloped nation category to the

75
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:47,964
developing nation state.

76
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:50,964
Other Asian nations, such as South Korea

77
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:53,884
, India, Thailand or the Philippines have gone through the same process,

78
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,674
often even faster:

79
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:58,304
investments in health and education

80
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,334
led to fewer births, which changed the composition of the population,

81
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:04,434
and allowed  the government to boost the economy.

82
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:08,584
Why didn't such a thing happen everywhere, even in sub-Saharan Africa?

83
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:11,614
Africa itself has made great progress

84
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,384
in reducing infant mortality, however, especially in sub - Saharan Africa

85
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,018
, education has been implemented more slowly

86
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,039
than in other parts of the world.

87
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,559
Furthermore, although contraceptive use has doubled since 1990,

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,439
the lack of modern contraceptives among adolescents

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,239
is still around 60%.

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,339
The reasons are complicated,

91
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,119
and it is impossible to give a single answer.

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,099
Africa is a very large territory, with cultures and people different from each other;

93
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,799
however, there are some common factors.

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,159
Many sub-Saharan nations were subject to colonial domination

95
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,219
until a few decades ago,

96
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,839
and had a troubled path towards independence.

97
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,779
The new nations were often ethnically heterogeneous and lacked unity;

98
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,804
many areas were repeatedly ravaged by civil wars,

99
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,994
military conflicts, or suffered from unstable governments;

100
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:01,679
this made it difficult to develop infrastructure and a health system.

101
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,039
So Africa had a worse starting point than Asia

102
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,419
Foreign aid, and how it was used, especially during the Cold War,

103
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,904
is still a controversial topic.

104
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:13,944
However, this topic is too complex for it to be summarized in a few sentences,

105
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:17,759
so, in the future, we will create a whole video about it.

106
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,899
Finally, there are cultural aspects that make it difficult to talk about family planning in the African context.

107
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,699
Critics argue that trying to lower fertility

108
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,719
is an intrusion into culture and tradition,

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,834
but not talking about a problem won't help solve it.

110
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:35,624
Not all of this is true for every nation in the region,

111
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,519
after all, we are talking about forty-six nations

112
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,499
some with serious problems, others already thriving;

113
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,379
they are all different but face the same problem:

114
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,644
if population growth continues at the current rate

115
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:52,764
then sub-Saharan Africa will reach over four billion by 2100.

116
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,999
Well, then, what can be done?

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,219
In fact, a lot!

118
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,139
Especially investments that help build systems for education,

119
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,439
family planning and health care.

120
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,839
Surprisingly, small changes

121
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,179
can have a big impact:

122
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,184
for example, if women had a better education,

123
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:13,654
they would have their first child two years later.

124
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,694
This small gap between the first generation and the second

125
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:19,699
would lead to 400 million fewer people by 2100,

126
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,899
with 3.6 billion in total.

127
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,639
If education and family planning became available to every African woman,

128
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,279
universal access to contraception would make having a child a choice.

129
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,284
If families could choose how many children they want,

130
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:37,364
both projections drop 30%

131
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:40,379
to 2.8 billion people.

132
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,259
This is not just theory.

133
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,454
There are already examples that are a reason to be optimistic.

134
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:48,584
Ethiopia, the second largest nation in Africa by population,

135
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:51,979
has made a lot of progress in a relatively short period of time.

136
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,939
Innovative health services have led to a reduction in infant mortality

137
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,344
from 20% to 7%

138
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:59,279
since 1990.

139
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,379
In addition, more than 30% of the annual budget

140
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,999
has been invested in schooling,

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,839
and the number of schools has increased twenty-fivefold in two decades.

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,354
So, to sum it up:

143
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:13,974
there are many challenges to be faced, but they are far from unsolvable.

144
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,854
Sub-Saharan Africa does not need to be given anything,

145
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:19,194
but attention and prudent investments.

146
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:22,184
it is a region rich in resources, culture and potential.

147
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:25,299
If things go right, we will see a change similar

148
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:32,719
to what we have seen across much of Asia over the past 30 years.

149
