1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,619
Microbes are everywhere,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,199
on your phone,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,059
in your water bottle,

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,919
on your hands before you wash them,

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,159
on your hands after you wash them,

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,739
and literally everywhere else on top of you too.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,299
Microbes are omnipresent at any moment,
and there is nothing we can do about it

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,419
So, millions of years ago we made a pact,

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,339
we give them shelter and food,

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,079
and in turn they work for us.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:44,099
But the more we learn about this partnership,
the more it looks like a cold war

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,299
Inside our mother's womb,
humans start out sterile

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,799
When we are born and traveling
through the birth canal,

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,119
billions of our mother's bacteria cover
every single part of our bodies.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,899
This is an essential part of human health.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,319
Children born via C-section have a
higher rate of asthma,

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,919
immune diseases and even leukemia.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,779
So our bodies do not only accept the invasion
of microorganisms, they welcome it.

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,099
Over millions of years, we co-evolved to
make the best of our relationship.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,599
Mother's milk for example,

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,619
contains special sugars that are
meant to feed and support

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,139
certain groups of microbes,

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,739
work as a decoy for others,

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,639
and help to modulate the 
immune system.

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,019
It takes up to two years, until a healthy
microbe community has formed.

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,119
Every human has their own unique microbiome,
made up of bacteria,

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,679
viruses, fungi and other organisms.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,979
We have three categories of guests,
on and in our bodies.

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,899
One:

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,099
Quiet passengers that do their own thing,
and are politely ignored.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,499
By being there, they take up space and keep
more aggressive intruders in check.

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,449
Two:

33
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,919
Guests that harm us,

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,739
But with whom we've learned to live,

35
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,279
for example, bacteria that literally create 
acid that melts our teeth,

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,739
if we don't brush enough.

37
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,299
They want to take up as much
space as they can,

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,879
and we don't want them to.

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,859
But, we can't get rid of them entirely.

40
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,978
Three:

41
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,079
Friendly fellows that our bodies
want to have around,

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,219
most of them are a community of
380,000 billion bacteria,

43
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,099
from up to 5,000 different species,
that live in our gut.

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,899
These gut microorganisms help us digest food,

45
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,239
and pull additional calories from things
that we can't digest ourselves.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,439
Unfortunately, our gut is also the
perfect point of attack for intruders,

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,539
so it's guarded by an aggressive army,

48
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,479
our immune system.

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,799
To survive here, our microbiome
co-evolved with us

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,179
to be able to communicate
with our body.

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,139
The most important part of that is to ask
the immune system to not kill them.

52
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,239
But, they also have a real motivation
to keep our gut healthy,

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,339
so some of them produce a
messenger substances,

54
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,599
that help to educate the immune system,

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,039
and others stimulate the gut cells
to regenerate faster.

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,639
But, over the last few years.

57
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,879
Evidence has emerged that the
influence of our gut microbiome,

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,879
goes much much further.

59
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,779
It might even talk directly to our brain.

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,239
We've observed a few curious things,

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,539
90% of our body's serotonin,

62
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,959
an important messenger substance
for nerve cells,

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,899
is produced in the gut.

64
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,539
Some scientists think the
microbiome does this,

65
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,639
to communicate with the vagus nerve.

66
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,499
The information highway of our nervous system.

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,259
Other examples are bacteria that
stimulate immune cells in the gut,

68
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,279
so they send a kind of alarm
signal to the brain.

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,499
Here, it activates immune cells that help
the brain recover from injuries.

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,019
Since the brain decides what we eat,

71
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,839
the microbiome is interested
in a healthy brain.

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,459
A new field of science is
opening up here,

73
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,139
and we're just on the verge of
understanding how these

74
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,759
complex systems inside our bodies interact.

75
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,119
But we are starting to see how
much our microbiome

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,179
actually influences us and our behavior.

77
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,439
Take depression for example,

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,699
Healthy rats fed microbes from the 
guts of depressed people,

79
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,259
began showing anxiety-like behavior,

80
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,979
and symptoms that look like depression.

81
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,359
And in early 2017, a study linked the
microbiome to intelligence,

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,499
by connecting a certain set up
of bacteria in newborns,

83
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,179
with better motor and language skills.

84
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,259
But it might also influence our daily lives.

85
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,739
Tests with fruit flies,

86
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,959
showed that their microbiome, influenced
what kinds of food they craved.

87
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,719
This could mean your microbes are
able to tell your brain,

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,399
which food it should get them.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,359
Although, this is not a one-way street

90
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,199
The seed for our microbiome
comes from our mother,

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,279
but how it develops and changes, is
determined by what we eat.

92
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,279
the organisms in our gut feed
on different things,

93
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,679
some like fibers and leafy greens,

94
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,899
others go for sugars and starches,

95
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,039
and some love greasy fries and butter.

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,819
Our gut is like a garden in which
we constantly decide,

97
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,079
what will grow and blossom.

98
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,679
If we eat healthily, we breed bacteria
that like healthy food.

99
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,459
If we eat a lot of fast food, then we
breed fast food loving bacteria.

100
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,339
Life is hard, so we can get trapped
in a vicious circle.

101
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,119
You have a stressful time, and eat lots
of burgers and fries and pizza.

102
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,639
This is awesome for fast food bacteria,

103
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,719
they multiply and multiply, and take up space
from vegetable loving bacteria.

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,679
But even worse, they send signals to the
brain to continue what it's doing.

105
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,799
this makes you want more
fast food.

106
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,919
Which breeds more fast
food bacteria,

107
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,019
which makes you crave fast food,
and so on.

108
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,219
This kind of self-reinforcing cycle,

109
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,359
could play a huge role in obesity.

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,239
But, it's important to stress that you
can fight this process,

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,399
and reverse it, by eating healthily and
breeding more good bacteria.

112
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,759
Beyond weight gain, our microbiome
has also been linked to other

113
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,659
serious diseases like autism,

114
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,879
schizophrenia, and cancer.

115
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,599
One of the earliest symptoms of Parkinson's,
is actually gut problems.

116
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,679
If your body is overrun with
bacteria that harm you,

117
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,899
there is often only one solution.

118
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,359
You bring in an army of good guys.

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,819
That's very easy,

120
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,099
You just transplant some healthy poop.

121
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,819
You do that by literally transferring poop,
from a healthy person,

122
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,579
into your gut.

123
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,799
This method is already used,
to cure diarrhea

124
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,199
that's caused when C. difficile bacteria,
take over a gut microbiome.

125
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,319
But we just don't know enough about
the complex interplay at work here yet.

126
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,519
For example, a transplant from an overweight
donor cured a woman's diarrhea,

127
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,759
but contributed to her obesity down the line.

128
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,939
This caused some ways and another
study tried to reverse the effect.

129
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,059
Poop transplants from slim people
to obese ones,

130
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,439
gave them a more diverse microbiome,

131
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,899
and made them less sensitive to insulin.

132
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,599
Both things that also happen when
people lose weight

133
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,719
We need to do a lot more science,
to really understand

134
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,319
how our microbes make us
healthy or sick.

135
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,119
But, whether we like it or not.

136
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,799
We need our microbiome, and it needs us.

137
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,539
We'll never have our bodies to ourselves.

138
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,059
But we have gained a powerful ally,

139
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
if we can just keep the peace.
