1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,979
Nothing in the universe is static. In the Milky Way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,099
Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:19,179
30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,139
This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,079
This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,779
Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,419
Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there.

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,639
But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point,

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,119
we could encounter a star going supernova or a massive object passing by and showering Earth with asteroids.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,919
If something like this were to happen, we would likely know thousands if not millions of years in advance.

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,999
But we still couldn't do much about it.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,259
Unless,

13
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,699
we move our whole solar system out of the way.

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,659
[Snazzy Kurzgesagt intro music]

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,359
To move the solar system,

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,319
we need a stellar engine, a megastructure used to steer a star through the galaxy. It's the kind of thing

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,859
that might be built by an advanced civilization with Dyson sphere-level technology

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,899
that's thinking about their future millions of years ahead of time.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,479
But how do we possibly move the hundreds of thousands of objects in the solar system?

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,359
The good news is we can ignore all of that.

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,919
We only need to move the Sun; all the other stuff is glued to it by gravity and will follow it wherever it decides to go.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,809
There are lots of ideas about what a stellar engine might look like and how it would work.

23
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,329
We've picked two, grounded in our current understanding of physics, that could be built in theory.

24
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,059
The simplest kind of stellar engine is the Shkadov thruster, a giant mirror.

25
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,269
It works on the same principle as a rocket.

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:17,529
Like rocket fuel, the photons released as solar radiation carry momentum, not a lot but a bit.

27
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:25,029
For example, if an astronaut turned on a flashlight in space, it would push them backwards very very slowly.

28
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,569
A stellar engine will work a little better than a flashlight because the Sun produces a lot of photons.

29
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,399
The basic idea of the Shkadov thruster is to reflect up to half of the solar radiation

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,048
to create thrust, and slowly push the Sun where we want it to go.

31
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:47,798
In order for the Shkadov thruster to work, it must be kept in the same place, not orbiting the Sun.

32
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:55,029
Although the Sun's gravity will try to pull it in, it would be supported by radiation pressure which props the mirror up.

33
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:03,279
This means the mirror would have to be very light, made of micron thin reflecting foil from materials like aluminium alloys.

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,219
The mirror's shape is important too,

35
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,199
enveloping the Sun in a giant spherical shell wouldn't work because that would refocus light back to the Sun,

36
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,939
heating it up and creating all sorts of unpleasant problems.

37
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:23,769
Instead we use a parabola, which sends most of the photons around the Sun and in the same direction, which maximizes thrust.

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,779
To prevent accidentally burning or freezing Earth with too much or too little sunlight,

39
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,539
the only safe place to build a Shkadov thruster is over the Sun's poles.

40
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,779
This means we can only move the Sun vertically in the plane of the solar system and one direction in the Milky Way,

41
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,539
which limits our travel options abate.

42
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,119
But that is basically it.

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,879
For a civilization capable of building a Dyson Sphere, this is a relatively simple endeavor.

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,019
Not complicated, just very hard to build.

45
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:04,379
At full throttle, the solar system could probably be moved by about a hundred light years over 230 million years.

46
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,199
Over a few billion years, it gives us near complete control over the sun's orbit in the galaxy.

47
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,539
But in the short term, this might not be fast enough to dodge a deadly supernova. That's why we thought we could do better.

48
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,259
So we asked our astrophysicist friend if he could design a faster stellar engine for this video.

49
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,599
He did and wrote a paper about it that's been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

50
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,539
You can find it in our sources document.

51
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,979
We're going to call at our new stellar engine the Caplan thruster.

52
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,069
It works a lot like a traditional rocket: shoot exhaust one way to push yourself the other.

53
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:52,179
It's a large space station platform powered by a Dyson sphere that gathers matter from the Sun to power nuclear fusion.

54
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:59,739
It shoots out a very fast jet of particles at nearly 1 percent the speed of light out of the solar system.

55
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,309
A second jet pushes the Sun along like a tugboat.

56
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,499
The Caplan thruster requires a lot of fuel, millions of tons per second.

57
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,979
To gather this fuel, our thruster uses very large

58
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:19,119
electromagnetic fields to funnel hydrogen and helium from the solar wind into the engine.

59
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,359
The solar wind alone doesn't provide enough fuel though, and that's where the Dyson sphere comes in.

60
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,799
Using its power, sunlight can be refocused to the surface of the Sun.

61
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,979
This heats small regions to extreme temperatures, lifting billions of tons of mass off the Sun.

62
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:42,069
This mass can be collected and separated into hydrogen and helium.

63
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,259
The helium is burned explosively in thermonuclear fusion reactors.

64
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,159
A jet of

65
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:56,319
Radioactive oxygen at a temperature of nearly a billion degrees is expelled and becomes our primary source of propulsion from our stellar engine.

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,809
To prevent the engine from just crashing into the Sun, it needs to balance itself.

67
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,679
To do this,

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:10,959
We accelerate the collected hydrogen with electromagnetic fields using particle accelerators and shoot a jet back at the Sun.

69
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,899
This balances the thruster and transfers the thrust of our engine back to the Sun.

70
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:25,329
In as little as a million years, this engine can move the Sun by 50 light years, more than enough to dodge a supernova.

71
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:32,589
At full throttle, the solar system can be completely redirected in its galactic orbit in 10 million years.

72
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,459
But wait, will we use up the Sun this way?

73
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,059
Fortunately the Sun is so massive that even billions of tons of material will barely scratch the surface.

74
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,859
In fact, this megastructure will actually extend our Sun's life, since lower mass stars

75
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,919
burn slower, keeping the solar system inhabitable for many more billions of years.

76
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,439
With a Caplan thruster, we could turn the entire solar system into our spaceship.

77
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,039
For example, by orbiting backwards in the galaxy and

78
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,359
colonizing hundreds or thousands of stars as we pass by them.

79
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,019
It may even be possible to escape the galaxy entirely and expand beyond the Milky Way.

80
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:22,999
Stellar engines are the kind of machines built by civilizations thinking not in terms of years or decades but eons.

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,299
Since we know that our Sun will die one day, a stellar engine could allow the far future descendants of humans to travel to other stars

82
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:38,079
without ever having to venture into the terrifying dark abyss of interstellar space.

83
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,209
Until we build a stellar engine, we're adrift and subject to the whims of the Galactic sea.

84
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,059
We may not like where it leads us.

85
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:55,819
Maybe our descendants will set sail and become an interstellar species for millions of years to come.

86
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:02,979
This was our last video for the year 12,019 of the human era, and what a year it was.

87
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,668
So much stuff happened everywhere, to so many different people.

88
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:15,559
Calendars and holidays are just imaginary, but they help us to cut our lives into pieces that our brains can handle.

89
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,579
We're leaving 12,019 behind with a weird mixture of disillusion and hope. The world is screwed up,

90
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:29,959
But we can fix it. In a few days, this year will be over, and we'll get to try again.

91
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:37,180
Thank you for watching our videos, and for sticking around for so many years. See you all in 12,020.
