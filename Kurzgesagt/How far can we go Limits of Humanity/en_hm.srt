1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,079
Is there a border we will never cross?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,659
Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try?

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,639
Turns out there are.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,599
Even with science fiction technology, we are trapped in our pocket of the universe.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,799
How can that be?

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:29,759
And how far can we go?

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,158
We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,879
a spiral galaxy of average size about one hundred thousand light years across,

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,919
consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds,

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,179
dark matter, black holes, neutron stars, and planets,

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,939
with a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,679
From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,279
it consists mostly of empty space

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,459
With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star will take thousands of years

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,759
So our galaxy is... pretty big.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,219
The Milky Way is not alone, though.

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,039
Along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than fifty dwarf galaxies,

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,919
it's part of the "local group"

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,699
a region of space about ten million light years in diameter

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,699
It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea Supercluster.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,699
Which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the observable universe.

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,699
Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,879
Humanity becomes a type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens,

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,699
and develops interstellar travel based on our current understanding of physics.

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,319
In this best case scenario, how far could we possibly go?

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,379
Well,

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,699
the Local Group.

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,179
It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of.

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:04,359
While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000000001% of the observable universe.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,759
Let this number sink in for a moment.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,939
We are limited to a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe.

32
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,939
The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us,

33
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,359
and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch is kind of frightening.

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,479
Why can't we go further?

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,079
Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,119
Nothing, or empty space, isn't empty but has energy intrinsic to itself,

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,099
so-called quantum fluctuations.

38
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,799
On the smallest scale, there is constant action.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,479
Particles and anti-particles appearing and annihilating themselves.

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,719
You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions.

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,339
Now, let's go back 13.8 billions of years, when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all.

42
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,239
Right after the Big Bang, in a event known as cosmic inflation,

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,719
the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometres in fractions of a second.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,219
This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extreme

45
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,599
that all of those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well,

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,819
and subatomic distances became galactic distances.

47
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,779
With dense, and less dense regions.

48
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,679
After inflation, gravity began to pull everything back together.

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,139
At the larger scale, the expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome,

50
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,119
but at smaller scales gravity emerged victorious.

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,319
So, over time, the denser regions or pockets of the universe...

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,699
grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today.

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,579
Only stuff inside our pocket, the Local Group, is bound to us gravitationally.

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,019
But wait, what's the problem then?

55
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,559
Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one?

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,439
Here, dark energy makes everything complicated.

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,599
About six billion years ago, dark energy took over.

58
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,919
It's basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe.

59
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,659
We don't know why, or what dark energy is. But we can observe its effect clearly.

60
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,619
In the early universe there were larger cold spots around the Local Group...

61
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,779
that grew into large clusters with thousands of galaxies.

62
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,379
We are surrounded by a lot of stuff.

63
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,359
But none of those structures and galaxies outside of the Local Group are gravitationally bound to us.

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,519
So the more the universe expands,

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,299
the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes.

66
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,539
Over time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us,

67
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,039
causing all the other clusters, galaxies and groups to eventually become unreachable.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,319
The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away.

69
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,719
But all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't ever hope to match.

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,319
We could leave the Local Group and fly through intergalactic space into the darkness,

71
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,019
but we would never arrive anywhere.

72
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,579
While we will become more and more stranded,

73
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,559
the Local Group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,599
with the unoriginal name: Milkdromeda... In a few billion years.

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,359
But it becomes even more depressing.

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,699
At some point, the galaxies outside the Local Group will be so far away...

77
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,639
that they will be too faint to detect ...

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,379
and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such long wavelengths that they will be undetectable.

79
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,559
Once this happens, no information outside the Local Group will be able to reach us.

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,019
The universe will recede from view.

81
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,359
It will appear to be dark and empty in all directions,

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,879
forever.

83
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,819
A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe!

84
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,259
When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness.

85
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,939
They won't be able to see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang.

86
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,759
They will have no way of knowing what we know today.

87
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,319
The nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.

88
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,419
They will think the universe is static and eternal.

89
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:27,019
Milkdromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker.

90
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,079
Still, with its trillion stars,

91
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,459
the Local Group is certainly large enough for humanity.

92
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,059
After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our Solar System...

93
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,779
and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy.

94
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,499
We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time,

95
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,219
to see not only our future, but also our most distant past.

96
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,219
As isolated and remote as the Local Group is,

97
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,793
we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it is right now.

98
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:02,853
