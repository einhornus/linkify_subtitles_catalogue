00:00:00,244 --> 00:00:04,379
As the year 12.021 slowly comes to an end,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:12,205
we present to you the 12.022
human era calendar, Eons edition.

3
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:13,222
As always,

4
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:16,899
we're adding 10.000 years to the regular
calendar to represent the human era

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,189
and include all cultures around the world,

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,389
but this year we're expanding the scope
beyond humanity

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,097
to showcase forgotten animals and plants
from all across the phanerozoic Eon

8
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:33,072
like giant armored fish, scythe lizards or
giant sloths, on 12 elaborate pages.

9
00:00:33,073 --> 00:00:37,488
Witness how multicellular life has
persisted for over half a billion years,

10
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:43,309
surviving asteroid impacts, volcanoes and
frozen oceans and of course pandemics.

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,631
In the end, life er... finds a way,

12
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:49,561
and we want to celebrate that.

13
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:54,702
You can get the very shiny high quality
limited edition now, until we sell out and

14
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:59,339
then never again, to support what we do on
this channel, to fill the void

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,854
in your soul, or just to have
something beautiful to look at.

16
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:06,384
As every year, we also have bundles and
special calendar deals

17
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:11,012
with some of your favourite products.

18
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:15,374
Thank you so much to all of the thousands
of birbs who get the calendar every year,

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:19,695
you enable us to create videos
and to publish them for free for everyone.

20
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:24,923
We wish you a happy year 12.022.
