1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,838
you're not a person

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,279
you're a planet

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,959
made of roughly 40 trillion cells

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,359
there is so much of you that if your

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,839
cells were human sized you'd be as big

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,319
as 20 mount everest

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,879
for your creepy crawly inhabitants this

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,599
makes your body an ecosystem rich in

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,118
resources and warmth and space a perfect

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,598
place to move into and have a family

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,159
while some of these guests are welcome

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,678
most are not your immune system is the

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,078
guardian of this planet the force tasked

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,919
with protecting yourself against the

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,398
constant danger of invasion

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,119
unfortunately your enemies in the tiny

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,719
world have a huge advantage

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,680
[Music]

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,159
consider the effort it takes to make a

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,999
single copy of yourself and your

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,599
trillions of cells

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,358
first you need to find someone who

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,238
thinks you're cute date and be awkward

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,118
and if things work out in a complicated

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,319
dance two of your cells merge together

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,239
then you need to wait for months while

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,719
the cell multiplies over and over until

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,719
it's released into the world as a human

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,679
being

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,319
and even then you only have a mini copy

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,559
that needs years to become remotely

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,839
useful

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,118
a bacterium consists of one cell it can

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,438
make a fully grown copy in about half an

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,239
hour

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,399
a virus can turn into hundreds within

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,758
hours and billions within days

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,078
your enemies multiply orders of

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,798
magnitude faster than you even worse for

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,879
a bacterium or virus your body is a

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,359
hostile ecosystem applying selective

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,478
pressure

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,919
because they go through so many

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,639
generations so quickly eventually by

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,039
pure chance there will be an individual

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,959
that mutates and adapts in just the

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,599
right way to resist your defenses and

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,319
then multiply quickly again in other

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,639
words you're facing a sheer endless

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,879
variety of different enemies and you're

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,758
too slow to keep up with their evolution

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,599
this is bad

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,159
luckily your immune system is just about

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,639
the most amazing thing ever

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,799
the second most complex biological

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,519
system known to us after the human brain

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,839
and so sophisticated that we still

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,559
haven't discovered all its secrets since

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,039
it's so complicated we have to simplify

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,999
and focus on one thing at a time if you

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,679
want the full story wait for the

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,079
announcement at the end of the video

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,399
okay so why are we not all killed by

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,799
some new bacteria or virus

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,119
in a nutshell you actually have two

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,439
immune systems the innate and the

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,679
adaptive immune system

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,679
the innate immune system was ready when

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,878
you were born

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,878
it mostly consists of general purpose

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,279
soldiers we introduced them in the last

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,719
immune video

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,878
the adaptive immune system carries two

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,839
types of cells t-cells and b-cells that

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,839
are your super weapons and are

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,079
incredibly effective and deadly for your

77
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,439
enemies

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,518
these cells are complicated to produce

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,598
and take a lot of time to deploy but

80
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,759
once they're ready they pack a real

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,119
punch

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,199
what makes your adaptive immune system

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,919
so powerful is that it has the largest

84
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,878
library in the universe it has an answer

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,079
to everything

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,079
you have at least one of these super

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,079
weapon cells inside you to fight the

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,559
black death the coronavirus and the

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,479
first deadly bacteria that will emerge

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,439
in a city on mars in 100 years

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,039
this makes it possible for you to

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,119
counter the ability of bacteria and

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,999
viruses to change so rapidly

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,759
how is this possible

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,919
to understand what's going on here we

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,399
need to take one step back

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,479
all organisms on earth are made from the

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,759
same basic parts mostly proteins

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,999
proteins are the building blocks of life

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,679
and can have billions of different

101
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,399
shapes you can imagine them as 3d puzzle

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,598
pieces

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,359
there are billions of different puzzle

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,598
pieces your enemies can use to construct

105
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,958
their bodies

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,798
why is this important

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,359
because proteins are in a way the

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,679
language of the micro world

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,399
cells don't have eyes or ears so to tell

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,719
friend from foe they have to touch them

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,797
and recognize if their protein is part

112
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,357
of a friend or part of an enemy

113
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,278
recognizing means that cells have

114
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,679
countless tiny devices called receptors

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,599
that are able to connect with a specific

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,279
protein puzzle piece

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,599
so your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,439
their outsides that are able to click

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,679
together or recognize other protein

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,159
puzzle pieces when a cell connects

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,638
together with a protein and recognizes

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,198
it as enemy it knows that it has to

123
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,478
attack

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,399
only if your cells can make this

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,638
distinction between friend or foe is

126
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,638
your immune system able to fight an

127
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,758
invader

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,599
but since there are billions of possible

129
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,758
protein puzzle pieces this means there

130
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,918
are billions of possible enemy puzzle

131
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,279
pieces

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,198
this is also one of the reasons we still

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,038
have to deal with diseases like the flu

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,359
each year the influenza virus mutates

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,198
very rapidly and so the proteins that

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,439
make up its hull constantly change a

137
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,879
tiny bit

138
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,478
the soldiers of your innate immune

139
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,319
system have a large number of the puzzle

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,719
pieces for common bacteria and viruses

141
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,719
memorized that's why they are your

142
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,559
all-purpose weapons

143
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,719
but they are ineffective against many

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,359
billions of mutations and adaptations

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,758
that your enemies can develop

146
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,159
so the reason you are still alive is

147
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,079
that your adaptive immune system is able

148
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,879
to recognize between 1 billion and 10

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,879
billion different enemy protein puzzle

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,719
pieces which is enough to be prepared

151
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,719
for every possible enemy

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,638
but how is this possible

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,399
how could your immune system possibly

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,478
have this much of a variety to be

155
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,399
prepared for every possible protein

156
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,079
puzzle piece

157
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,239
well the cells of your adaptive immune

158
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,478
system found a cheat code

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,239
mixing and matching their own genetic

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,559
code to create this stunning variety of

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,839
receptors

162
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,679
the details are way too complicated for

163
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,519
this video but in a nutshell your

164
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,439
adaptive immune cells have official

165
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,359
permission to take a tiny part of their

166
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,839
own genetic code and mix it in random

167
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,999
ways to create billions of different

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,359
receptors

169
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,359
a good way to explain this is by asking

170
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,679
you to imagine an army of cooks with

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,359
each of them wanting their own special

172
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,478
recipe

173
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,799
they have 100 different ingredients to

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,918
choose from

175
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,318
each ingredient stands for one tiny

176
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,279
piece of genetic code in this metaphor

177
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,439
so each cook takes a few random

178
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,359
ingredients and randomly mixes them

179
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,399
together maybe tomato chicken rice and

180
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,038
half an onion as entree marshmallow

181
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,198
pepper strawberries and a quarter banana

182
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,559
as a dessert

183
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,959
or cucumber beef potatoes and two

184
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,879
carrots and blueberries chocolate and

185
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,439
cream with a pinch of cinnamon

186
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,839
even with slight variation and with only

187
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,318
100 ingredients there are billions of

188
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,079
possible recipes

189
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,399
and likewise with just a small selection

190
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,559
of gene fragments your cells create

191
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,559
billions of receptors

192
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,478
the details of this are so cool that

193
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,959
they should get their own video or their

194
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,559
own chapter in a book

195
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,359
in any case by mixing up gene fragments

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,279
you get up to 10 billion different

197
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,719
combinations

198
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,799
so in the end you get billions of immune

199
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,598
cells and each of them has one specific

200
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,079
and unique receptor the dish from our

201
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,399
metaphor that is able to recognize one

202
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,638
specific protein puzzle piece

203
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,799
in total you end up with at least one

204
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,038
cell for every enemy that could possibly

205
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,999
exist but here we run into a pretty

206
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,239
dangerous problem if your adaptive

207
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,159
immune system is making weapons that can

208
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,918
attack every possible protein puzzle

209
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,999
piece in the universe wouldn't it also

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,119
make some that can attack your own cells

211
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,679
yes it happens all the time

212
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,679
this is so fundamentally dangerous to

213
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,519
your survival that you have a whole

214
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,359
organ that does nothing but work on

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,038
preventing this

216
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,079
the murder university of your thymus

217
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,318
your thymus is a chicken wing-sized

218
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,999
organ above your heart and you've

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,679
probably never heard of it

220
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,758
interestingly your thymus is one of the

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,839
reasons why your immune system weakens

222
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,918
as you age because it's in a constant

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,638
state of decline once you reach puberty

224
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,198
but what does the thymus do

225
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,679
in your murder university your immune

226
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,519
system is putting your adaptive immune

227
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,598
cells through an intense and deadly

228
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,198
curriculum

229
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,279
basically it's showing them all sorts of

230
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,119
protein puzzle pieces that are used by

231
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,999
your own cells to see how they react

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,318
when a young cell recognizes a body

233
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,398
puzzle piece and wants to attack it the

234
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,999
teachers cells order them to kill

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,158
themselves and they are eaten up and

236
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,999
recycled

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,319
the immune system is so particular about

238
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,359
this process that around 98 of your

239
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,359
adaptive immune cells that enter murder

240
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,679
university die there

241
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,999
two percent graduate and get to do their

242
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,559
job of protecting you for real

243
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,799
if this process goes wrong and the cells

244
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,479
escape that can recognize your own

245
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,719
protein puzzle pieces this can lead to

246
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,719
autoimmune disease where your immune

247
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,479
system attacks your own body from the

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,759
inside

249
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,919
and this again is another story for

250
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,439
another time

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,999
okay let's summarize

252
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,319
your immune system has two parts one

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,239
that defends you right after birth and

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,159
one that carries the largest library of

255
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,239
super weapons in the universe but needs

256
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,919
to boot up first

257
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,759
to create billions of different super

258
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,838
weapons your adaptive immune cells

259
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,838
recombine a part of their genetic code

260
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,759
to create a breathtaking variety of

261
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,278
attack weapons

262
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,679
then they enter a murder university that

263
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,759
only two percent survive to make sure

264
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,159
they don't attack you and then you end

265
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,079
up with billions of different cells that

266
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,398
in total are able to protect you against

267
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,359
every possible enemy in the universe

268
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,999
now wait a second if this is all true

269
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,319
why do we get sick at all

270
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,639
why was a new disease like covert 19

271
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,958
able to kill millions of people

272
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,359
and how do vaccines boost the mechanisms

273
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,879
we explained in this video to

274
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,799
supercharge your immune system and

275
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,639
defend you from the worst diseases

276
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,719
humanity has ever encountered from

277
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,439
smallpox to covet 19.

278
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,278
well everything we've just learned about

279
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,159
is a tiny tiny window into the amazing

280
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,239
struggle for life and death that plays

281
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,559
out every day inside your body and there

282
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,398
are so many amazing details and

283
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,679
questions here

284
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,518
how does your body actually find the

285
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,919
right cell in time to protect you

286
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,679
how do your enemies fight back and

287
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,159
overcome your immune system anyway

288
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,919
and what about all the things that

289
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,799
didn't fit in this video

290
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,838
well today finally marks the release of

291
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,159
immune a journey into the mysterious

292
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,398
system that keeps you alive written by

293
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,239
philip detmer the founder and head

294
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,879
writer of courts first we had to push

295
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,319
the release back because of cargo

296
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,239
trouble and then because so many of you

297
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,919
pre-ordered that we didn't have enough

298
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,479
copies for the original launch day thank

299
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,799
you so so much for that

300
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,639
immune tells the epic story of your

301
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,639
immune system and will forever change

302
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,559
how you think about your own body how

303
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,119
you experience being sick and healthy

304
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,719
the book is written to be as fun and

305
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,199
easy to grasp as koski's art videos but

306
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,039
is able to dive way deeper into its

307
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,278
subjects so go on a journey through the

308
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,518
hidden microverse within yourself

309
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,919
witness deadly wars between billions of

310
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,319
invaders and cells learn how your immune

311
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,559
system actually works and protects you

312
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,518
from cuts cancer and covet

313
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,679
never before have we so urgently needed

314
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,479
to learn about how immunity works

315
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,199
immune is fun and great to look at and

316
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,039
it even smells good

317
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,479
