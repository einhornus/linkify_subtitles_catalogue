1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,680
You are not a person, you are a planet, 
made of roughly 40 trillion cells.  

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,040
There is so much of you, that 
if your cells were human-sized,  

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,000
you would be as big as 20 Mount Everests. For your 
creepy-crawly inhabitants, this makes your body an  

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,720
ecosystem, rich in resources and warmth and space. 
A perfect place to move into and have a family.  

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,160
While some of these guests are welcome, most 
are not. Your immune system is the guardian  

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,679
of this planet, the force tasked with protecting 
yourself against the constant danger of invasion.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,840
Unfortunately your enemies in the 
tiny world have a huge advantage.

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,320
Consider the effort it takes to make a single copy 
of yourself and your trillions of cells. First you  

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,240
need to find someone who thinks you are cute, 
date and be awkward and if things work out in a  

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,079
complicated dance, two of your cells merge 
together. Then you need to wait for months  

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,040
while the cell multiplies over and over until 
it is released into the world as a human being.  

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,960
And even then you only have a mini copy 
that needs years to become remotely useful.

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,680
A bacterium consists of one cell. It can make 
a fully grown copy in about half an hour.  

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,800
A virus can turn into hundreds within 
hours and billions within days.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,000
Your enemies multiply orders 
of magnitude faster than you.  

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,240
Even worse, for a bacterium or virus 
your body is a hostile ecosystem  

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,400
applying selective pressure. Because they go 
through so many generations so quickly, eventually  

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,680
by pure chance, there will be an individual 
that mutates and adapts in just the right way  

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,240
to resist your defenses and then multiply quickly 
again. In other words, you are facing a sheer  

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,040
endless variety of different enemies and you’re 
too slow to keep up with their evolution.

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,640
This is bad.

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,680
Luckily your immune system is just about 
the most amazing thing ever. The second most  

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,840
complex biological system known to us, after the 
human brain, and so sophisticated that we still  

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,080
haven’t discovered all its secrets. Since it is 
so complicated we have to simplify and focus on  

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
one thing at a time. If you want the full story, 
wait for the announcement at the end of the video!

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,680
Ok, so why are we not all killed by some 
new bacteria or virus? In a nutshell,  

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,800
you actually have two immune systems, the 
innate and the adaptive immune system.  

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,320
The innate immune system was 
ready when you were born.  

29
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,920
It mostly consists of general purpose soldiers, 
we introduced them in the last immune video.

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,560
The adaptive immune system carries two types of 
cells T Cells and B Cells that are your super  

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,960
weapons and are incredibly effective and deadly 
for your enemies. These cells are complicated to  

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,080
produce and take a lot of time to deploy but 
once they are ready, they pack a real punch.

33
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,920
What makes your adaptive immune system 
so powerful is that it has the largest  

34
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,680
library in the universe. It has an answer to 
everything. You have at least one of these  

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,880
super weapon cells inside you to fight the 
black death, the corona virus and the first  

36
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,080
deadly bacteria that will emerge in a city 
on Mars in one hundred years. This makes it  

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,200
possible for you to counter the ability of 
bacteria and viruses to change so rapidly.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,440
How is this possible? To understand what is 
going on here, we need to take one step back.

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,920
All organisms on earth are 
made from the same basic parts,  

40
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,000
mostly proteins. Proteins are 
the building blocks of life  

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,880
and can have billions of different shapes 
- you can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces.  

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,160
There are billions of different puzzle pieces 
your enemies can use to construct their bodies.

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Why is this important? Because proteins are 
in a way the “language” of the microworld.  

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,600
Cells don’t have eyes or ears, so to tell friend 
from foe, they have to touch them and recognize  

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,760
if their protein is part of a friend or part of an 
enemy. Recognizing means that cells have countless  

46
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,720
tiny devices called receptors, that are able to 
connect with a specific protein puzzle piece.  

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,000
So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their 
outsides that are able to click together,  

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,520
or recognize other protein puzzle pieces. 
When a cell connects together with a protein  

49
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,840
and recognizes it as “enemy”, 
it knows that it has to attack.

50
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Only if your cells can make this 
distinction between friend or foe  

51
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,120
is your immune system able to fight an invader.

52
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,960
But since there are billions of 
possible protein puzzle pieces,  

53
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,720
this means there are billions of possible enemy 
puzzle pieces. This is also one of the reasons  

54
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,360
we still have to deal with diseases like the 
flu each year – the influenza virus mutates  

55
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,000
very rapidly and so the proteins that make 
up its hull constantly change a tiny bit.

56
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,280
The soldiers of your innate immune system have 
a large number of the puzzle pieces for common  

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,120
bacteria and viruses memorized, that’s why 
they are your all purpose weapons. But they are  

58
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,960
ineffective against many billions of mutations 
and adaptations that your enemies can develop.

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,800
So the reason you are still alive is that your 
Adaptive immune system is able to recognize  

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,160
between one billion and ten billion different 
enemy protein puzzle pieces, which is enough  

61
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,520
to be prepared for every possible enemy. But 
how is this possible? How could your immune  

62
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,040
system possibly have this much of a variety to be 
prepared for every possible protein puzzle piece?

63
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,760
Well, the cells of your adaptive immune system 
found a cheat code: mixing and matching their own  

64
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,680
genetic code to create this stunning variety of 
receptors. The details are way too complicated for  

65
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,040
this video but in a nutshell, your adaptive immune 
cells have official permission to take a tiny part  

66
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,640
of their own genetic code and mix it in random 
ways to create billions of different receptors.

67
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,920
A good way to explain this is by asking 
you to imagine an army of cooks, with each  

68
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,360
of them wanting their own special recipe. They 
have 100 different ingredients to choose from.  

69
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,400
Each ingredient stands for one tiny 
piece of genetic code in this metaphor.

70
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,240
So each cook takes a few random ingredients 
and randomly mixes them together.  

71
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Maybe Tomato, Chicken, Rice 
and half an onion as entree,  

72
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,920
Marshmallow, Pepper, Strawberries 
and a quarter banana as a dessert.

73
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,600
Or Cucumber, Beef, Potatoes and two carrots,  

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,480
and blueberries, chocolate and 
cream with a pinch of cinnamon.

75
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,200
Even with slight variation 
and with only 100 ingredients,  

76
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,400
there are billions of possible recipes. 
And likewise, with just a small selection  

77
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,320
of gene fragments, your cells create billions 
of receptors. The details of this are so cool  

78
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,440
that they should get their own video – or 
their own chapter in a book. In any case,  

79
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,520
by mixing up gene fragments, you get up to ten 
billion different combinations. So in the end,  

80
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,440
you get billions of immune cells, and each of 
them has one specific and unique receptor – the  

81
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
dish from our metaphor – that is able to 
recognize one specific protein puzzle piece.  

82
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,320
In total, you end up with at least one cell 
for every enemy that could possibly exist.

83
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,440
But here we run into a pretty dangerous problem 
– if your adaptive immune system is making  

84
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,200
weapons that can attack every possible 
protein puzzle piece in the universe…  

85
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,960
wouldn’t it also make some that can attack 
your own cells? Yes, it happens all the time.

86
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
This is so fundamentally dangerous to 
your survival that you have a whole  

87
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,360
organ that does nothing but work on preventing 
this: The Murder University of your Thymus.  

88
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,040
Your Thymus is a chicken wing sized organ above 
your heart and you've probably never heard of  

89
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,640
it. Interestingly, your thymus is one of the 
reasons why your immune system weakens as you age,  

90
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,080
because it is in a constant state of decline once 
you reach puberty. But what does the Thymus do?

91
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,920
In your murder university, your immune 
system is putting your adaptive immune cells  

92
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,280
through an intense and deadly curriculum. 
Basically it is showing them all sorts of  

93
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
protein puzzle pieces that are used by 
your own cells to see how they react.  

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,440
When a young cell recognizes a body puzzle piece 
and wants to attack it, the teacher cells order  

95
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,080
them to kill themselves and they are eaten up 
and recycled. The immune system is so particular  

96
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,320
about this process that around 98% of your 
adaptive immune cells that enter murder university  

97
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,680
die there. 2% graduate and get to do 
their job of protecting you for real.

98
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,840
If this process goes wrong and cells escape that 
can recognize your own protein puzzle pieces,  

99
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,160
this can lead to autoimmune disease, where 
your immune system attacks your own body  

100
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,480
from the inside. Andt this, again 
is another story for another time.

101
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,680
Ok, let us summarize. Your immune system has 
two parts, one that defends you right after  

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,760
birth and one that carries the largest 
library of superweapons in the universe  

103
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,440
but needs to boot up first. To create billions 
of different superweapons, your adaptive immune  

104
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,560
cells recombine a part of their genetic code to 
create a breathtaking variety of attack weapons.  

105
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,520
Then they enter a murder university that only 2% 
survive to make sure they do not attack you. And  

106
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,400
then you end up with billions of different cells, 
that in total are able to protect you against  

107
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,000
every possible enemy in the universe. 
Now wait a second. If this is all true,  

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,400
why do we get sick at all? Why was a new disease 
like Covid-19 able to kill millions of people?

109
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,880
Well everything we just learned about is just a 
tiny, tiny window into the amazing struggle for  

110
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,320
life and death that plays out every day inside 
your body and there are so many amazing details  

111
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,360
and questions here: How does your body actually 
find the right cell in time to protect you?  

112
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,680
How do your enemies fight back and 
overcome your immune system anyway?  

113
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,840
And what about all the things 
that did not fit in this video?

114
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,120
Well, today finally marks the release of “Immune 
– A Journey Into the Mysterious System that Keeps  

115
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,080
You Alive”, written by Philipp Dettmer, 
the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt.  

116
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,760
First we had to push the release back 
because of cargo trouble and then because so  

117
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,760
many of you pre-ordered that we didn’t have 
enough copies for the original launch day!  

118
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
Thank you so, so much for that!

119
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,720
Immune tells the epic story of your 
immune system and will forever change  

120
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,200
how you think about your own body, how 
you experience being sick and healthy.  

121
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,320
The book is written to be as fun and easy to grasp 
as Kurzgesagt videos but it is able to dive way  

122
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,040
deeper iinto its subject. So go on a journey 
through the hidden microverse within yourself.  

123
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,360
Witness deadly wars between billions of invaders 
and cells, learn how your immune system actually  

124
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,760
works and protects you from cuts, cancer and 
Covid. Never before have we so urgently needed  

125
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,400
to learn about how immunity works. Immune is fun 
and great to look at and it even smells good.

126

Follow the link in the 
description to order it today.  

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,680
This is the end of a decade-long 
personal journey working on this,  

128
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:41,840
thank you all so, so much for your support. 
And thank you for watching. And reading.
