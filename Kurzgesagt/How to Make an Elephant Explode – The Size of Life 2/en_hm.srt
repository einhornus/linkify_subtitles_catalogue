1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,259
Let's shrink an elephant to
the size of a mouse

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,899
and enlarge a mouse, and make it
the size of an elephant,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,399
because this is our video,
and we want to see what happens.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,199
First: our now tiny elephant, stumbles around
and then drops dead.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,899
Tiny elephant buddy is very cold; frozen
to death in minutes.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,219
Our giant mouse looks very uncomfortable
for a moment, and then it explodes.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,899
leaving hot mouse insides everywhere.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,379
Why?

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,799
Because of size.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,879
We are optimized to function precisely
for the size we are,

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,599
and would die horribly
in any other environment.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,379
But, why exactly?

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,119
Why does our mouse explode,

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:50,839
and can we do this to our
elephant too, if we try hard?

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,179
Life on this planet is based on cells.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,979
Cells do vary in size.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,279
But they're pretty similar in their dimensions
across all species.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,139
A blue whale doesn't have bigger cells
than a hummingbird,

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,159
just a lot more of them.

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,659
Cells have to do a lot of stuff to stay alive.

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,919
And they need energy to be able to do so.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,379
To get this energy,

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,159
animal cells convert food
and oxygen into usable chemical energy.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,379
This happens in our mitochondria,

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,399
the powerhouse of the cell.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,139
They're like little coal engines
that spit out tiny ATP batteries,

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,559
which the cell can use for almost
everything it needs to do.

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,299
Just like an engine, mitochondria get
really hot while working.

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,879
In human skin cells,

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,699
they reach a scorching 50 degrees Celsius.

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,719
And some of our cells
have up to 2,000 mitochondria

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,399
which are radiating their heat into the cell.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,539
So, being alive generates a lot of heat.

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,239
The more cells you have, the more heat
your body generates in total.

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,479
If our bodies didn't
find ways of losing this heat,

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,559
we would be cooked from the inside and die.

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,719
But this is a problem for bigger animals

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,539
because of the way bodies change as
living beings scale up.

39
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,419
Animals have 3 properties
here that are important.

40
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,839
Their length, their outsides or skin,

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,019
and their insides, like organs,

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,138
bones, and hopes and dreams.

43
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,519
The thing that's hard to wrap your
head around is that when things grow,

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,179
their insides grow faster than their outsides.

45
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,739
Imagine a fleshy cube.

46
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,879
If you double the length of its sides,

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,399
its surface and volume do not double.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,619
In fact, the surface is now 4 times
the original size,

49
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,259
and the volume of the cube
8 times the original size.

50
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,319
Which is called the Square Cube Law,

51
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,659
and has been annoying nature
for billions of years.

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,659
So why is this a problem for big animals?

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,139
Because heat can only leave
an object via its surface.

54
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,679
So if we make our mouse
the size of an elephant,

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,359
or 60 times longer,

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,419
it has 3,600 times more surface
from which to lose heat.

57
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,099
But it has 216,000 times more volume

58
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,539
filled with trillions
and trillions of new hot mitochondria

59
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,539
that produce more heat.

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,679
A lot more insides; not that much more skin.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,639
Our mouse is very dead, very fast.

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,559
But big things like elephants exist.

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,019
So how do they deal with the heat?

64
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,259
For one, they evolved ways to get rid of
energy more easily

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,659
like huge flat ears, that have a lot of surface
where heat can escape.

66
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,979
But that's not enough.

67
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,359
Nature's solution is actually very elegant.

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,219
Elephant cells are much, much
slower than mice cells.

69
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,139
The bigger an animal is,
the less active its cells are.

70
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,119
If we classify animals, by their
metabolic rates, and compare

71
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,299
that to their overall mass,
It's clearly visible.

72
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,499
It's not 100% accurate,

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,799
but it is a good rule of thumb.

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,959
Elephants are huge meat sacks filled with

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,479
trillions and trillions of little coal ovens.

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,599
So, they keep the ovens just active
enough to keep them running

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,779
and never at full power.

78
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,999
Their whole metabolism is slow.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,999
Things move at a nice chill pace.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,919
Small animals need to go
the exact opposite way.

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,039
If you're small, you
have a lot of surface area

82
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,359
compared to not a lot of volume.

83
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,219
You don't have a lot of cell ovens

84
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,419
and lose the heat
they produce very fast.

85
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,559
So very tiny mammals came up with
a very extreme solution.

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,839
Meet the Etruscan Shrew,
the smallest mammal on Earth.

87
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,259
A mole-like thing that's more closely
related to hedgehogs than to mice.

88
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,479
With the body length of 4 centimeters,

89
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,139
it only weighs about 1.8 grams - as much as a paperclip.

90
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,539
It's a tiny ridiculous being.

91
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,819
It would basically cool off immediately,

92
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,539
so its cells run on overdrive to stay warm.

93
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,879
Its tiny ovens are filled at maximum capacity.

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,779
Its heart beats up to 1,200 times a minute,

95
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,419
and it breathes up to 800 times a minute.

96
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,999
This creates an extreme need for energy.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,039
So the shrew has to eat constantly.

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,339
After only 4 hours without food, it starves to death.

99
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,499
And while an African elephant

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,719
consumes around 4% of its body weight
in food each day.

101
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,279
Our shrew needs 200% of its body weight

102
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,639
in food a day just to survive.

103
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,119
Imagine having to eat
2,000 Big Macs a day

104
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,579
more than one a minute.

105
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,619
Fun for a while, but then not so much.

106
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,399
So, a cubic centimetre of shrew
needs 40 times more food

107
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,299
than a cubic centimetre of elephant.

108
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,659
If an elephant's cells

109
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,139
suddenly become as active as
the cells of a shrew

110
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,999
a crazy amount of heat
would be generated.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,979
All the liquids in the elephant
would suddenly start boiling.

112
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,359
And then it would explode

113
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,739
in an impressive explosion of steaming
hot burning elephant parts.

114
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,179
In reality, before an explosion occurred

115
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,359
the proteins making up
our cells would probably be denatured,

116
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,999
and stop producing heat.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,739
But a meat explosion is much more fun

118
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,219
than melting an elephant
into a massive hot goo.

119
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,899
Regardless, the scaling of the speed of 
metabolism happens everywhere.

120
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,719
Even in places we don't expect,
like pregnant women.

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,079
A baby in the womb of its mother behaves
as if it were a part of her.

122
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,919
Its cells have about
the same metabolic rate,

123
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,639
the same speed of life, 
as its mother's organs.

124
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,939
It is truly a part of a bigger whole,
rather than an individual.

125
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,039
Until it's not anymore.

126
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,919
The very moment a baby is born,
a switch is flipped

127
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,319
and all its internal
processes speed up rapidly.

128
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,879
36 hours after birth,

129
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,439
the baby's cells have the same activity
rate as a mammal its size.

130
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,119
Babies literally transition
from being an organ

131
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,679
to being an individual, in mere hours.

132
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,079
But there's one thing where big and small things
are very similar:

133
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,779
Heartbeats.

134
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,319
Mammals tend to have a similar
amount of heartbeats, over their lifetime.

135
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,119
Typically around 1 billion.

136
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,799
So, while the shrew and elephant
are very different,

137
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,259
they share a similar number of heartbeats
over the course of their lives.

138
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,139
Their speed of life is the opposite
and somehow still the same.

139
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,059
And, for a video in which we made elephants
explode for no good reason.

140
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,260
This is the most romantic ending
we could come up with.
