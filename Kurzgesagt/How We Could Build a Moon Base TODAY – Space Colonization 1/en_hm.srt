1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,099
Humans dream about leaving Earth
and traveling through the galaxy.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,999
But we were born too early to be part of it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,999
Or were we?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,199
The reality is,

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,359
we could begin our dream
by building a Moon base today.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,499
We actually do have the technology

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,299
and current estimates from NASA
and the private sector

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,899
say it could be done for 20 to 40 billion dollars,
spread out over about a decade.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,199
The price is comparable to
the International Space Station

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,099
or the budget surplus of Germany in 2017.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,799
Not that big an investment really.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,399
The payoff would be immeasurable.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,299
The Moon is a sandbox to develop new technologies and exploit unlimited resources.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,999
It would start a new space race

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,799
and lay the foundation for us to spread out
into the solar system and beyond.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,099
It would create a vast array of new
technologies to benefit us on Earth

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,399
and we would all be part of it.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,499
So, why aren't we doing it?

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,799
Well, sadly, it's hard to get governments interested in long-term investments in the future of humanity.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,399
Let's imagine, just doing it.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:17,359
If we start today, how would we build a Moon base?

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,999
(Kurzgesagt intro music)

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,799
Kurzgesagt in collaboration with BRILLIANT

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,899
Throughout history,

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,899
colonization happened in phases:

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,719
In the first phase of the age of exploration
of the new world, for example,

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,199
European monarchs funded expeditions to chart
and discover and to stake their claims.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,099
They planted a flag and set up a camp,
but they didn't stay.

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,799
In the second phase, small missions set up outposts and settlements were founded,

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,299
which was still very dependent on
their home countries for supplies.

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,099
Some failed, but others survived and
established a permanent presence.

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,299
Only then, in the third phase, did a true colony form

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,719
to which tradesmen and laborers could emigrate,

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,499
creating new wealth and opportunities
for themselves and their families,

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,198
sending extreme wealth back
to their countries of origin.

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,999
When we colonize the Moon,

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,299
we'll go through the same three phases.

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,099
This time, without murdering millions
of innocent people in the process.

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,499
The Moon is not a welcoming place for living things.

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,599
A Moon day lasts 29 Earth days,

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,799
with a difference of maybe 300 degrees
Celsius between sunlight and shade.

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,999
There's no atmosphere to shield us from meteorites,
big and small, or cosmic radiation.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,999
Worse still, the lunar surface is covered
in a layer of nasty jagged dust.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,799
The Moon is hard.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,479
But we're good at doing hard things.

46
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,799
In the first phase of lunar colonization,

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,799
our explorers proved it can be done

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,099
that a new world can be reached.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,499
This phase started 60 years ago with the Apollo missions.

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,099
Since then, satellites like the American Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have mapped the Moon,

51
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,399
while rovers like the Chinese Yutu (玉兔), have studied the composition of the lunar surface,

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,999
Looking for water, ice, and metals.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,399
Phase one is more or less complete.

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,499
We know what we need to know to enter phase two.

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,899
In the second phase,

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,899
astronauts will build the first Moonbase and this could begin today.

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,399
The first small Moonbase could
be completed in a decade.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,799
The first nation that establishes this base,

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,699
will be akin to the first nations building outposts in the new world 500 years ago.

60
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,199
It's expensive to send rockets to the Moon.

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,899
So we will send as little as possible.

62
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,299
The base will be light,

63
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,199
little more than inflatable habitats for crews of no more than 12,

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,999
and will be deployed somewhere with natural shelter.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,899
Options include caves, like underground lava tube tunnels,

66
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,099
or craters near the poles, where the days are six months long.

67
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,599
These astronauts will not stay long.

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,499
The habitat is likely to be abandoned between missions,

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,499
as solar panels cannot generate
electricity during the lunar night.

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,699
But they'll do the groundwork to enable
humans to stay permanently.

71
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,899
Our first crew will consist of scientists and engineers

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,899
who will study the composition of the Moon

73
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,199
and whose experiments will explore ways
of using the available lunar material.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,999
Say, and purifying the lunar ice and turning
it into the water for human use.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,898
And water is important for far more than drinking.

76
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,359
They can use it to experiment with growing plants for food.

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,399
Hydrogen fuel cells will store power through the long night,

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,699
extending astronauts' stays.

79
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,299
And most importantly:

80
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,199
It could be split into hydrogen and oxygen.

81
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,299
Rocket fuel!

82
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,499
By harvesting water from the Moon and putting it into orbit,

83
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,999
the Moon base will supply an orbital depot.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,999
Where scientific missions to Mars and the outer solar system can refuel.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,199
Compared to the Earth, it's much easier and cheaper to get things off the Moon into orbit.

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,499
Colonizing Mars may mean starting from the Moon.

87
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,999
But this isn't a true colony, not yet.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,799
The base will be abandoned if funding stops.

89
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,599
If we want our base to grow into the third phase, into a true colony,

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,899
it must become self-sufficient supporting itself via exports to Earth.

91
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,899
Now, private contractors arrive looking to get rich off lunar resources and support services.

92
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,499
If it's cheaper to produce rocket fuel in space,

93
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,299
what else can they get rich on?

94
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,299
They could extract precious metals,

95
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,099
abundant in impact craters

96
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,199
and other raw materials from the lunar regolith.

97
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,499
One promising possibility is the mining of Helium-3,

98
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,099
an isotope that could one day be used in nuclear fusion reactors,

99
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,399
something the Chinese lunar exploration
program is currently looking into.

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,899
Future colonists may export Helium-3 back to Earth,

101
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,599
providing us with cheap and clean fusion energy.

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,199
Asteroids could be pulled into the Moon's orbit and then mined.

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,199
With commercial exports to Earth,

104
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,499
the colony is fully in its third phase,

105
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,999
self-sufficient and economically productive.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,719
Our base will begin using lunar material in its construction projects if it's to continue growing.

107
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,679
Fortunately, lunar soil has all the necessary
ingredients to make concrete.

108
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,499
Robotic mining rigs can sift the lunar dust for organic molecules

109
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,799
and could be used to build huge structures

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,199
way too massive to be brought from Earth.

111
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,299
While advances in 3D printing,

112
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,819
will make it possible to produce almost
everything else the crews need.

113
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,499
It's hard to say when exactly the colony
becomes self-sustaining.

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,899
Growth is gradual,

115
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,299
experiments are replaced by industry

116
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,039
and the population steadily reaches the hundreds,

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,599
encompassing more than just scientists.

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,399
Engineers, pilots, and contractors representing countries and corporations will be present.

119
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,999
Two of these people will make a breakthrough.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,599
Not scientific, but social.

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,999
They will have the first extraterrestrial child.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,999
Throughout history,

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,199
the birth of the first child was celebrated
as a moment where the seed of a colony

124
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,099
finally and irreversibly took root.

125
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,599
Here, it means that the Moon is not just a place for scientists and engineers to work,

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,599
it's a place for people to live, to raise a family.

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,199
Once this transition happens, the colony grows rapidly,

128
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,399
building more habitats and schools and farms and all the things needed to support the growing population.

129
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,099
As our colony grows, all kinds of new technologies will be invented to sustain it.

130
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,799
They might develop crops that efficiently recycle carbon dioxide,

131
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,199
or the grow with very little water.

132
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,599
They might find ways to recycle and reuse 100% of their waste,

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,999
technologies that are extremely valuable for Earth.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,199
They could even build the first space elevator in the solar system.

135
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,299
With a space elevator, spacecraft, astronauts and raw materials,

136
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,599
could be brought back and forth from lunar orbit, without needing to use rockets at all.

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,799
The Moon may become a hub for economic activity on a scale that's hard to imagine right now.

138
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,699
It's hard to say who will own the colony at this point.

139
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,799
Will the first person born on the Moon
take the national identity of their parents,

140
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,939
or will a new generation meld together
into a new lunar society?

141
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,399
And when existing treaties that bar any nation from owning the moon are inevitably rewritten,

142
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,399
will the colonists be given a say?

143
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,799
Will they declare independence from the Earth?

144
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,099
However it happens,

145
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,298
the Moon is a perfect sandbox to learn
how to colonize the Solar System,

146
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,599
the perfect project unify nations,

147
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,099
and the only way to guarantee our survival as a species,

148
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,899
should something tragic happen on Earth?

149
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,399
If we ever want to colonize the Milky Way,

150
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,759
we'll have to start somewhere.

151
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,799
So why not start there?

152
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,999
Why not start now?

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,599
While unfortunately you can't jump on a spacecraft

154
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,499
and go to the Moon right now,

155
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,199
you can learn more interesting things
about space and our universe.

156
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,399
And we can even help you with that.

157
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,999
Kurzgesagt and Brilliant are collaborating
on a six-part video series

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,099
about our favorite science and space topics.

159
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,599
Kurzgesagt has worked with Brilliant for a while now

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,419
and we love what they're doing.

161
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,399
In a nutshell, Brilliant teaches you science
and maths with a hands-on approach,

162
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,399
by solving puzzles yourself, you learn to understand
concepts instead of just memorizing facts.

163
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,699
