1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,539
A lot of things can be beautiful.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,199
Landscapes, faces, fine art, or epic architecture; stars in the sky.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,799
Or simply the reflection of the sun on an empty bottle.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,389
Beauty is nothing tangible, it only exists in our heads as a pleasant feeling.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:25,209
If we have to define it, we perceive something as beautiful if its color, shape, form, or proportion

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,268
somehow are appealing or delightful to us.

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,799
Beauty is a very human experience that's been with us for millions of years.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,549
Even our first tools were trimmed to a symmetrical shape.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:44,799
Researchers have tried to find practical reasons why our ancestors invested the time to make their tools look nice, but couldn't really identify any.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,429
It seems that early humans shaped their tools into teardrops, simply because they liked them better that way.

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,299
Throughout our history, the definition of beauty has changed a lot.

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,599
Ideals have shifted or turned into their opposites.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,799
But beyond individual and contemporary tastes some things have never really gone out of fashion.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:12,728
The golden ratio, symmetry, or fractal patterns can be found in the art and architecture of cultures from our beginnings, to today.

15
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:18,039
Humans seem to be in mysterious, inherent agreement about the beauty of certain things.

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,999
The patterns that keep coming up are all rooted in nature.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,209
They became part of our biology because they helped our ancestors survive.

18
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,599
Fractal patterns for example, occur all over nature.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,798
In snail shells, flower heads; waves or clouds

20
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,419
Identifying and assessing these things and phenomena correctly used to be vital.

21
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:51,199
Do those clouds mean rain will come soon? Are these waters safe to swim through? Can I eat this?

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,599
Another pervasive thing is symmetry.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,449
In nature it means everything is as it should be

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,599
Stems and trees and leaves and blossoms all grow symmetrically

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,999
A deer with impressive antlers is probably a source of nutritious meat.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,659
A deformed wheat hair may not be safe to eat.

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,759
A symmetrical face is more likely to belong to a healthy and fertile mating partner.

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,399
Because symmetry is so common in fauna and flora, it's extremely familiar to our brain.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,299
It helped our ancestors evaluate their environment more easily, and react quickly to danger.

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,479
Things that helped us survive activate the reward center in our brain.

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,828
recognising signals of safety and nutrition, triggered nice feelings in us.

32
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:40,099
So our sense of beauty probably evolved from pattern recognition, but it goes way beyond that now.

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,599
Humans seem to have evolved an instinct for beauty that is deeply hardwired into us.

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,539
It remain even after other processes in our brain stop working.

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,949
Alzheimer's patients were asked to rank the beauty of several paintings

36
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,949
Then the experiment was repeated two weeks later

37
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,068
The patients have long since forgotten the paintings, but still ranked the beauty of the paintings in the same order.

38
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:09,679
One could argue that this doesn't say much. So what if people stick to their personal preferences?

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,169
But other research has shown that we have a sort of lowest common denominator when it comes to beauty.

40
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,789
In different experiments, people were asked to distinguish real from fake abstract paintings.

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:27,289
Some were originals by Mondrian and Pollock that were painted based on strict rules like fractal patterns, while the imitations were not.

42
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,599
The majority picked out the original artworks.

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,769
This worked for paintings from both artists, even though their arts are very different.

44
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:43,569
Another experiment also used abstract artworks but, asked people to pick them out among similar paintings made either by children or animals.

45
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,569
Again, the test subjects pointed out the legit paintings whose patterns were carefully planned and not random

46
00:03:49,570 --> 00:04:02,799
So while we have a hard time pinning down what beauty is or what it's based on, we somehow recognize it when we see it

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,519
Humans don't navigate nature trying to survive day by day anymore

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,999
We left the natural world behind and created our own.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,518
We made the objects that surround us the things we wear and use and look at.

50
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,069
As we spread over the planet and our numbers grew, we shaped a completely man-made environment.

51
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:28,199
In the process of doing so, we often neglected beauty in favor of functionality cost or efficiency.

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,399
We built rows and rows of concrete housing blocks that nobody wants to live in.

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,799
We have ugly underground subway stations, shabby public service buildings, and sprawling malls.

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,799
One bland, standardized box beside the next.

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,699
Humans, don't like monotony.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:50,859
Eye tracking software has shown that people keep focusing on details and ornaments of architecture while brushing quickly over blank walls

57
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,509
And not only are they no fun to look at, they actually make us miserable.

58
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:01,629
Experiments with skin sensors showed that looking at vast, dull facades makes us feel bored and uncomfortable.

59
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,719
This kind of boredom has been linked to raised heart rates and stress levels and the opposite seems to be true, too.

60
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:15,939
Over the last decades more and more studies have found that surroundings that are actually aesthetically pleasing to us can improve our well-being, our behavior,

61
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,199
cognitive function, and mood.

62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,259
Our bodies and brains react measurably and visibly to everything that surrounds us

63
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:30,999
Beauty in particular has such a strong impact on our well-being that making useful things beautiful can actually make them better.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,799
In 2017, a hospital examined recovery factors through observation and interviews with patients and found that visual art in their lounge areas

65
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,219
made them more comfortable and happier about their stay in general.

66
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,239
Another study looked at how well patients recovered in a hospital that had two wards.

67
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,199
A very old and rather ugly one, and a newly renovated ward.

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,999
To the researchers' surprise, the patients that stayed in the new, renovated environment, needed less pain medication

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,429
and were released on average, two days earlier than patients recovering in the old ward.

70
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,299
More beautiful surroundings made them feel better, physically.

71
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,199
Beauty also has an effect on us on a daily basis.

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,999
It can improve our general happiness.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,429
A study that looked at the main factors influencing the happiness of adults revealed an unexpected result.

74
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:26,468
Besides things like good health in a harmonious family life, individual happiness is affected by how beautiful you find the city you live in.

75
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,699
Beauty scored even higher than cleanliness or safety.

76
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,599
So what can we learn from all of this?

77
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,059
We know that we humans have been fine-tuned for millions of years to process visual input and assess our surroundings.

78
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:47,978
It's just what we're programmed to do and we're starting to learn more about how much beauty as a property is really influencing us.

79
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,848
Beauty meets an inherent need for meaningful information.

80
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:58,958
Maybe it would be worth giving it more space in this man-made world we have created.

81
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:06,899
This video was a collaboration with the creative agencies, Sagmeister and Walsh as a contribution to their upcoming beauty exhibition.

82
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:13,699
The exhibition will be shown at the Mak Vienna from Oct. 23, 2018 - Mar. 31, 2019

83
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,399
and a Mak Frankfurt from May 01, 2019 - Sept. 30, 2019

84
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,799
If you want to learn more about the impact of beauty and see tons of gorgeous installations and multimedia objects,

85
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,899
go check it out!
