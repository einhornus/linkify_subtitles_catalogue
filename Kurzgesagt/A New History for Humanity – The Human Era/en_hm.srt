1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,119
Humans have existed for millions of years, as part of nature.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,099
But then, something changed. And in an incredibly short amount of time..

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,619
..We terraformed this planet and designed it to fit our needs.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,679
As far as we know, we're the first beings to awaken and completely take over a planet.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,359
The transition from hunting and gathering to farming and building, was so breathtakingly fast,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,999
that many of our ways of thinking about the world are no longer useful.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,239
One of our most outdated ideas is that the most commonly used calendar in the world insists that we live in the year of 2016.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,619
This distorts our view of our own history, and makes it harder to understand who we are as a species,

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,139
and just how far we have come in an incredibly short amount of time.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,399
So, maybe it's time to choose a Year 0 for humanity.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,859
A Year 0 that truly represents us as a species and includes all cultures,

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,119
a Year 0 that marks when we began building our own world on top of the old one.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,839
*Kurzgesagt intro*

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,199
~The 1st temple~

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,879
12,000 years ago hundreds of humans came together in the hills of southern Anatolia.

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,439
They were hunters and gatherers without the knowledge of agriculture or metalworking.

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,099
All they had were tools made of stone and wood,

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,859
but they built humanity's first big construction project..

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,999
..7,000 years before the pyramids were built in Egypt.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,039
Spread over 300 meters our ancestors erected circles of massive stone pillars,

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,339
each of them up to 6 meters high and 40 tons in weight.

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,639
Decorated with art for pictograms and stone carvings of animals and mythical creatures.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,739
We have no idea how they were able to do this.

24
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,919
It was probably a project of epic scale for the Stone Age, requiring a level of organization we didn't know..

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,439
..early humans were capable of until we found this site.

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,879
So, why did they build it?

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,539
The most popular theory is that this was the first temple of humanity dedicated to long-forgotten Gods.

28
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,339
We only know that this construction project, the 1st-of-its-kind marks the beginning of a new era.

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,339
It's in this area, around that time, that humans truly began to build their own world.

30
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:34,279
Which would make it a fitting milestone in our history, for the start of our calendar.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,379
This moment in time is so distinct, that scientist Cesare Emiliani proposed that humanity..

32
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:48,179
..should switch to what he called the Holocene calendar, by adding 10,000 years to our current Gregorian calendar.

33
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,279
We don't need to change our well-established days and months,

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,459
and religious calendars could stay the same as well.

35
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:01,719
But for all official purposes, our current year will be the year 12,016 of the human era.

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,859
This would drastically alter how we think about history, and how it feels.

37
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,699
Let's take a very brief look, and move through our new history, from our New Year 0.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,219
~A new human history~

39
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,019
12,000 years ago saw the beginning of the first construction project,

40
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,739
kicking off our history.

41
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,919
It would be in use for about 2,000 years.

42
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,159
It took nearly a millennium until Jericho, probably the first city on Earth,

43
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,479
was founded in the year 1000 after the start of the human era.

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,419
Progress was still very, very, slow at this point. Over the next 1,000 years more and more..

45
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,019
..permanent settlements appeared around the world,

46
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,919
and more and more plants and animals were domesticated as agriculture spread.

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,859
Evidence for trade over thousands of kilometers has been found from this period.

48
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,119
Around 5,000,000 humans were alive at this point in history, fewer than live in London today.

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,219
Technology advanced constantly, at a slow pace.

50
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,559
Pottery became widespread.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,159
The first cultural communities appeared in China, India, and the Fertile Crescent.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,299
Around the Year 4000, 8,000 years ago from today, humans started to use metal for the first time,

53
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:22,018
learning to mix tin and copper and kick-starting what we know as the Bronze Age around the year 5000.

54
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,759
The first proto-writing emerged, and the wheel was invented.

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,019
In South America, the Chinchorro culture started to artificially mummify humans,

56
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,599
2,000 years earlier than in Ancient Egypt.

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,699
The first high cultures began emerging around the year 7000.

58
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:48,019
The Indus Valley Civilization, Ancient Egypt, the Minoans in Greece, and the Sumerians in Mesopotamia.

59
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,079
Stonehenge was built in Britain, and the first dynasty in China began.

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,779
Ã–tzi the Ice Man lived around this time.

61
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:04,779
What we consider history now started and things began picking up pace, as the world population rose to over 30,000,000.

62
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:11,199
A number of new high cultures appeared around the world, many writing down their legends.

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,439
More and more cities were founded.

64
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,979
In South America the Olmec culture emerged.

65
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,059
Around this time, the legendary siege of Troy is supposed to have happened.

66
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,759
Soon after in the eastern Mediterranean in the Fertile Crescent, the bronze age ended in violence.

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,119
Every Bronze Age culture, except Egypt, was destroyed by mysterious invaders.

68
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,759
Writing and progress froze for hundreds of years.

69
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,859
Around the Year 9500, what we consider Western culture began.

70
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,239
The Greek city-states beat off the persian invasion, and triggered their golden era,

71
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,039
ended by Alexander the Great around 9700.

72
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,699
100 years later, Rome destroyed Carthage, and became a dominant force in the world.

73
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:06,119
Caesar was murdered in the year 9956, while the world population had risen to about 300,000,000 people.

74
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,168
And it's only now around the year 10,000, that we've reached the point where the Gregorian calendar

75
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:16,159
and our current method of marking human history begins.

76
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,119
A mere 2,000 years from now, humans will walk on the moon.

77
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:28,499
If we think about history as we do now, we are underplaying 10,000 years of human progress and development.

78
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,319
Including all of it in our calendar makes our past more impressive.

79
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,449
It shows how progress became exponential with time, and it incorporates all humans from..

80
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,579
..all cultures into our calendar.

81
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,939
A New Year 0 for our history could re-frame how we think of ourselves.

82
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,199
As a building project that started 12,000 years ago when for the first time,

83
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,459
our ancestors came together to carve a temple out of bedrock with tools made of stone;

84
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,319
not knowing what they would set in motion,

85
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,239
where it would lead us as a species.

86
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,549
From building the first temple, to ships flying beyond the sky.

87
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,019
We've made a Kurzgesagt version of the human era calendar..

88
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,939
..that you can buy here if you want.

89
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,979
It's a calendar for 2017, but with one important difference.

90
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,499
It's for the year 12,017, the year we think we should be in right now.

91
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,959
There are only a very limited amount available, but if we sell enough of them,

92
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,099
we'll make this a regular thing, and maybe produce more print products in the future.

93
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,899
The calendar is illustrated, and we put in a few fun facts.

94
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,159
Also as always, if you like what we do, please consider supporting us on Patreon,

95
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,799
or buying things we made. It really helps!

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,720
Thanks, and have a happy 12,017!
