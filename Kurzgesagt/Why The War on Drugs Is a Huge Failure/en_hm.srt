1
00:00:00,321 --> 00:00:02,789
Over 40 years ago,
US President Richard Nixon

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,440
declared drug abuse
public enemy number one,

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:09,866
starting an unprecedented global campaign,
the War on Drugs.

4
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:11,941
Today, the numbers are in.

5
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:16,821
The War on Drugs is a huge failure,
with devastating unintended consequences.

6
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:19,156
It led to mass incarceration in the US;

7
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:22,354
to corruption, political destabilization,
and violence

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,663
in Latin America, Asia, and Africa;

9
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:28,229
to systemic human rights
abuses across the world.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,686
It negatively affected the
lives of millions of people.

11
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:34,605
All of this while we waste
billions of dollars every year

12
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:37,569
only to create and fuel
powerful drug cartels

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,323
while the goal of the War on Drugs
seems less achievable than ever:

14
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:43,324
a world without drugs.

15
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:54,428
How could this happen?

16
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,833
The core strategy of the War on Drugs is
“no drugs, no problems”.

17
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:01,382
So almost all of the efforts
in the last few decades

18
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:03,909
have been focused on eradicating
the supply of drugs

19
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,772
and incarcerating drug traffickers.

20
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:09,779
But this ignores the most
fundamental of market forces,

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,767
supply and demand.

22
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:15,203
If you reduce the supply of anything
without reducing the demand first,

23
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:17,194
its price goes up.

24
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:20,947
This might lower sales for many products,
but not for drugs.

25
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,939
The drugs market is not price-sensitive.

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,863
Drugs will be consumed
no matter what they cost.

27
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:30,109
So the effect is to encourage
production of more drugs and

28
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,325
recruitment of more traffickers,
which increases availability.

29
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:38,285
This is also known as the balloon effect:
even if drug production or

30
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:43,627
a major supply route is destroyed, the
supply for the end user is not reduced.

31
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:46,432
A perfect example of this is crystal meth.

32
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,610
The US Government tried
to stop its production

33
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:53,033
by strictly regulating the sale of
chemicals used to manufacture the drug.

34
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:55,287
This forced big meth producers
out of business,

35
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:59,326
but the unintended consequences were that
thousands of small-scale operations

36
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:03,355
started all over the country, mostly
in small towns and rural communities,

37
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,201
using chemicals that weren’t regulated.

38
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:10,581
In response to this, some US states wanted
to reduce the supply of home-grown meth

39
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:12,694
by regulating even more chemicals,

40
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,960
which reduced small-scale
meth production drastically.

41
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,778
But the supply of
meth still stayed the same.

42
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:23,832
Mexican drug cartels immediately took over
and opened big production operations.

43
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,841
Their meth was even better
than it was before,

44
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:28,868
and they had lots of
experience in smuggling.

45
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:31,579
So all these efforts made meth
production more professional,

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,892
the drug more potent, while
supply wasn’t reduced at all.

47
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:38,638
You can’t win this war on the supply side.

48
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,857
Not only are drugs widely available,
demand unbroken,

49
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:46,641
and some drugs purer than in the past,
with a budget of around $30 billion,

50
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:50,447
the US Drug Enforcement Agency has
an efficiency rate of less than 1%

51
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:53,215
when it comes to stopping
the flow of drugs into the US

52
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:54,997
and inside the US.

53
00:02:54,998 --> 00:03:00,362
For many minors around the world, it’s
as easy to get illegal drugs as alcohol.

54
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:01,694
But it doesn’t stop here.

55
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:04,715
Prohibition may prevent a certain
amount of people from taking drugs,

56
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:09,304
but in the process it causes huge
damage to society as a whole.

57
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:11,590
Many of the problems we
associate with drug use

58
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,296
are actually caused by
the war against them.

59
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:17,192
For example, prohibition
makes drugs stronger.

60
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:20,100
The more potent drugs you can store
in as little space as possible,

61
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:22,016
the more profit you’ll make.

62
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:23,943
It was the same during
alcohol prohibition,

63
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:27,384
which led to an increased consumption
of strong liquor over beer.

64
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:31,503
The prohibition of drugs also led to more
violence and murders around the world.

65
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:35,225
Gangs and cartels have no access to
the legal system to settle disputes,

66
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:37,249
so they use violence.

67
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,454
This led to an ever-increasing
spiral of brutality.

68
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:43,197
According to some estimates,
the homicide rate in the US

69
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:47,434
is 25–75% higher because of
the War on Drugs.

70
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,918
And in Mexico, the country
on the frontline,

71
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,634
an estimated 164,000 have been
murdered between 2007 and 2014,

72
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,593
more people than in the war zones
of Afghanistan and Iraq

73
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:00,660
in the same period, combined.

74
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:03,283
But where the War on Drugs might do
the most damage to society

75
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,594
is the incarceration of
non-violent drug offenders.

76
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:08,240
For example, the United States,

77
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:10,667
one of the driving forces
of the War on Drugs,

78
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:16,397
has 5% of the world’s total population,
but 25% of the world’s prison population,

79
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:20,814
largely due to the harsh
punishments and mandatory minimums.

80
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,647
Minorities suffer
because of this especially.

81
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:27,272
African Americans make up
40% of all US prison inmates.

82
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:30,074
And while white kids are
more likely to abuse drugs,

83
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:34,323
black kids are 10 times more likely
to get arrested for drug offenses.

84
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:37,524
OK, but is there actually
something different we could do?

85
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,639
Is there a way out of this mess?

86
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,648
In the 1980s, Switzerland experienced

87
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,515
a public health crisis
related to heroin use.

88
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:48,887
HIV rates skyrocketed and
street crime became a problem.

89
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,564
Swiss authorities tried a new strategy:
harm reduction.

90
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:54,794
They opened free
heroin maintenance centers,

91
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,225
where addicts would
be treated and stabilized.

92
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,929
Here, people would be given
free heroin of high quality,

93
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,606
they would get clean needles
and have access to safe injection rooms,

94
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:06,882
showers, beds, and medical supervision.

95
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:11,407
Social workers help them find housing and
deal with other problems in their lives.

96
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:14,035
The results were a sharp drop in
drug-related crime

97
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:16,921
and two thirds of the people in the
centers got regular jobs,

98
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:18,957
because now they could
focus on getting better

99
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,659
insetad of financing their addiction.

100
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,333
Today, over 70% of all heroin addicts
in Switzerland receive treatment.

101
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,146
HIV infections have dropped drastically.

102
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:33,168
Deaths from heroin overdoses
have dropped by 50%.

103
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,615
And drug-related street sex work and crime
has been reduced enormously.

104
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:40,015
So there are methods that are
not only way cheaper,

105
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:44,359
but also actually work, instead of
creating more problems.

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,413
Drug prohibition led to a system
that bulldozes human rights,

107
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:51,466
costs vasts sums of money, and
creates a lot of human misery,

108
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:54,960
all in pursuit of an unobtainable goal.

109
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:59,288
After 40 years of fighting, it’s time
to finally end the War on Drugs

110
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,447
and move on to something better.
