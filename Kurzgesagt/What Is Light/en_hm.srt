1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,459
Light, is the connection between us and the universe.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:10,539
Through light, we could experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:19,819
But, what is light?

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,819
In a nutshell

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,959
Light, is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,919
A photon, an elementary particle without a real size

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,019
That can't be split, only created or destroyed.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,539
Light also has a wave-particle duality

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,439
being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time (although this is a lie)

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,799
Also when we say light, we actually mean visible light

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,319
which is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum:

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,519
energy in form of electromagnetic radiation.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,279
Electromagnetic radiation consist of an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,279
Gamma rays have the smallest wave lengths

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,279
because they are the highest energy photons.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,679
But most gamma rays are just under ten picometers,

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,359
which is still way smaller than a hydrogen atom.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,059
For reference, a hydrogen atom compared to a cent

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,639
is about as big as a cent compared to the Moon.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,699
Visible light is in the middle of the spectrum

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,079
in a range of about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers:

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,539
about the size of a bacteria.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,959
On the other end of the spectrum,

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,299
radio waves can be up to 100 kilometers in diameter.

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,959
The biggest wave lengths we know exist

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,519
can span from 10,000 kilometers to a baffling 100,000 kilometers,

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,219
way larger than Earth.

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,719
From a physics stand point,

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,879
all these different waves are the same.

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,039
They all have the wave-particle duality and travel at 'c', the speed of light,

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,079
just at different frequencies.

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,519
So what makes visible light special, then?

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,059
Well... Absolutly nothing.

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,139
We just happen to have evolved eyes, that are good at registering

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,939
exactly this part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

36
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,779
This is not a complete coincidence though.

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,659
Visible light is the only set of electromagnetic radiation that propagates when in water,

38
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,019
which happens to be where most eyes first evolved, millions of years ago.

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,579
That was a smart move, because light not only interacts with matter,

40
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,199
it's also altered by it and can be used to gather information about the world around us,with almost no delay.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,399
Which is arguably really helpful for survival.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,539
Okay, where does light come from?

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:23,559
A vast range of electromagnetic waves are created when atoms or molecules drop from a higher state of energy to a lower one.

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,099
They lose energy and emit it in the form of radiation.

45
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,879
At the microscopic level, visible light is created when an electron within an atom in an excited state

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,139
drops to a lower energy state and loses this excess energy.

47
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,919
The same way, incoming light can elevate an electron to a higher state of energy

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,459
by being absorbed by it.

49
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,719
Macroscopically, the moving charge of the electron creates an oscillating magnetic field,

50
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,059
Which creates an oscillating electric field perpendicular to it.

51
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,119
These two fields move themselves through space, transferring energy from one place to another,

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,479
carrying information about its place of creation with it.

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,699
Why of all the things in the universe is light the fastest thing there is?

54
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,059
Let's change the question:

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,279
What is the fastest way to travel through space in the universe?

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,479
It's c, exactly two hundred ninety-nine million, seven hundred ninety-two thousand, four hundred and fifty-eight metres per second in a vacuum,

57
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,719
one billion kilometres per hour.

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,519
Electromagnetic radiation just happens to move this fast.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,979
Any particle that has no mass travels at c, without acceleration or any in between.

60
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,319
The light that has released from a candle does not speed up until it reaches light speed,

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,839
At the very instant of its creation, its speed is c.

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,399
So why is c, the speed of light, finite then?

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,359
Well, nobody knows.

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,399
Our universe is just built this way.

65
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,059
We don't have the smart answer here.

66
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,319
So light is part of a spectrum,

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,179
an elementary particle that also behaves like a wave,

68
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,399
Propelled by two perpendicular fields,

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,759
travelling at the speed limit of the universe.

70
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,999
Okay, that's nice and all, but what about the crazy stuff about

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,379
travelling at the speed of light,

72
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,079
and time, the twin paradox, quantum stuff, things like that?

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,479
We would have to save them for another video.

74
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,499
For now, let's be happy that we've evolved eyes that pick up

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,879
waves of information permeating the universe.

76
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,960
Making us see things and put our existence into perspective.
