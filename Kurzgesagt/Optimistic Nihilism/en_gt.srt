1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,018
Human existence is
terrifying and confusing.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,749
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, we had our selves and looked back

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,599
at this strange place where
we were.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,419
There were other beings here too.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,549
Some were edible and some were

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,819
trying to eat us.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,882
There were liquids to drink and the

8
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,499
ingredients to make other things.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,899
During the day, a small yellow ball floating in the sky
warmed our skin, and the

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,619
night sky was full of beautiful light
.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,099
In every way,
it seemed like a place made for us.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,939
There were also beings looking down on us.

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,404
We were at home.

14
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:34,964
This thought relieved my fear and confusion.

15
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,319
But as we get older,

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,959
we
start to get to know the world and ourselves more and more.

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,256
We
knew that beautiful starlight wasn't twinkling for us.

18
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:43,706
It was just there.

19
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:46,839
We also know that we are not at the center of what we call the universe
.

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,239
The universe
is much older than we thought.  I also learned that

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,799
our bodies are made up of dead little things
.

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,829
For some reason, dead things come together
to make bigger things that aren't dead.

23
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,457
And that we

24
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,379
live in an era that is only a brief passage through billions of years of history.

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,569
We found, surprisingly, that we live

26
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,319
on a damp speck of dust revolving around an ordinary-sized star, which is


27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,168

located in the quiet arm of an ordinary galaxy, and is in

28
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,119
a group of galaxies from which we will never leave
.

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,983
And the fact that this group of galaxies
is only one-thousandth of a supercluster that is formed by clusters of galaxies.

30
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:22,959
But even this supercluster is
only one-thousandth of the observable universe.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,729
The real universe may be millions of times bigger than this, but

32
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,579
we'll never know.

33
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,019
I mean, you can do anything.

34
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,899
There are billions of galaxies,

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,179
trillions of stars,

36
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,559
and planets on the sub-scale.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,569
But the numbers game is meaningless.

38
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,429
Our brain cannot count these numbers.

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,151
The universe is too big and

40
00:01:40,152 --> 00:01:42,093
too many.

41
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:45,649
However, the concept that is most difficult for us to accept
is not size.

42
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,479
It's time.

43
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,959
More specifically,
it is the time remaining for us.

44
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,959
If you are lucky enough to live 100 years,

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,259
you have 5200 weeks of time.

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,139
If you are 25 now, you have
3900 weeks left.

47
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,799
If you live to 70, you have
2340 weeks left.

48
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,459
It's not short, but
it's not long either.

49
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,939
And then?

50
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,739
Your biological processes will come to a standstill and the

51
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,209
turbulent waves of life will be quiet.

52
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,769
You will disintegrate until there are no more left
.

53
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,099
Some
say there is something that cannot be seen or touched, but

54
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,310
there is no way to confirm it.

55
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,161
So life will probably end like

56
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:30,919
this, and after this there will be only eternal death.

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,179
But it's not as scary as you might think.

58
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,719
If you
don't remember the 13.75 billion years that passed before you existed, then billions of

59
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,259
eons
will pass in the blink of an eye after you disappear.

60
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,399
Close your eyes and count to one.

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,979
That is the way of eternity.

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,830
As far as we know, conventionally the
universe will also die and

63
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:56,379
everything will be frozen forever.

64
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,319
Our videos
create an existential fear in many people.

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,879
Same goes for what I said earlier.

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,189
So, this
time, I would like to present a different perspective on this.

67
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,089

Let me tell you about Kurzgesakt's unscientific and subjective philosophy.

68
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,460
Just take it as an idea.

69
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,809
We
don't know more about human existence than you do.

70
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,779
We
overcome existential fear with optimistic nihilism.

71
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,389
What does that mean?

72
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,239
To put
it bluntly, it seems unlikely that so many stars could have been made for us.

73
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,979
In a way, it
seems like the cruelest joke on the planet.

74
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,439
We
barely realized that we were not the protagonists of the story.

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,999
Exploring electrons and mitochondria is good, but doing

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,619
science doesn't make this melancholic.

77
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,599
Yes, but how about that?

78
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,429
Life is only once.
That's scary.

79
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,459
But it is also a word that gives freedom.

80
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,455
If the universe freezes to death, all

81
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:55,579
your shame will be forgotten.

82
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,278
The mistakes you make

83
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,683
will end up being nothing.

84
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:01,599
The bad things you've done will also go blank.

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,089
If our life is the only thing we can experience, the

86
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,459
only thing that matters is our life.

87
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,554
If there are no principles in the universe, the

88
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:11,769
only meaningful principles are those
we set.

89
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,259
If the universe has no purpose, then

90
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,398
we determine the purpose of the universe.

91
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,189
Humans will surely disappear someday.

92
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,559
But before we disappear,
we look at ourselves and the world around us.

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,667
We feel emotions.

94
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,533
Eat delicious food, read a book, and watch the
sunrise.

95
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:31,209
with other people

96
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,919
It is already surprising that we can think of these
things.

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,188
It's
easy to think that a line is drawn between us and others, but

98
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,000
that's not true.

99
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:43,779
We are
just like neutron stars in the universe.

100
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,979
It's like black holes and nebulae.

101
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,545
Actually we are better.
We are the central organ of the universe responsible for our emotions and

102
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:52,059
thoughts.

103
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,709
We are truly free in the playground of space.

104
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,399
So maybe we dream so happily of building a utopia in space
.

105
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,399
We still have to find out.

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,139
We don't know why the laws of the universe are like that.

107
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,609
We do not know how life was born or
what life is.  We

108
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,964
don't know what consciousness is

109
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:14,559
, and we don't know whether we are alone in the universe.

110
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,539
But you can try to find the answer.

111
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,504
There are many stars to visit, many

112
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:20,944
diseases to be treated, many

113
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,169
people in need,

114
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,919
many happiness to enjoy,

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,899
many games to wake up to.

116
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,159
There's too much to do.

117
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,479
So to wrap up,

118
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,939
you've probably spent a lot of your good time
.

119
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,897
If you can only live one life

120
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:39,459
,
there is no reason not to live as fun and as happy as possible.

121
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,399
If you make other people's lives better, you
get an extra point.

122
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,679
If it could help build a galactic human empire, that would be the
best.

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,709
Do what makes you feel good.

124
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,027

You decide what that means.
