1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,018
Human existence is scary and confusing.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,599
A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,819
It was filled with other beings. We could eat some; some could eat us.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,499
There was liquid stuff we could drink; things we could use to make more things.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,899
The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,619
The night sky was filled with beautiful lights.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,099
This place was obviously made for us.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,939
Something was watching over us.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,019
We were home. This made everything much less scary and confusing.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,959
But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,659
We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,839
We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe,

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,899
and that it is much, much older than we thought.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,599
We learned that we're made of many little dead things,

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,679
which make up bigger things that are not dead, for some reason,

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,379
and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,319
We learned, in awe, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized star

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,839
in a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,719
And this group is only one of thousands that, together, make up a galaxy supercluster.

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,859
But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,579
The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know.

22
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,739
We can throw words around like two hundred million galaxies

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,559
or trillions of stars or bazillions of planets,

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,239
but all of these numbers mean nothing. Our brains can't comprehend these concepts.

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,999
The universe is too big. There is too much of it.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,519
But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,959
It's time, or, more precisely, the time we have.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,959
If you're lucky enough to live to one hundred,

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,119
you have five thousand two hundred weeks at your disposal.

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,959
If you're twenty-five now, then you have three thousand nine hundred weeks left.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,799
If you're going to die at seventy, then there are two thousand three hundred and forty weeks left -

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,459
a lot of time, but also ... not really.

33
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,939
And then what?

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,739
Your biological processes will break down,

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,059
and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop beinge dynamic.

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,579
It will dissolve until there is no you left.

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,939
Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure,

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,219
but we have no way to find out, so this life might be it

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,799
and we might end up dead forever.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,179
This is less scary than it sounds, though.

41
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,719
If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed,

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,979
Then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone.

43
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,399
Close your eyes. Count to 1.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,979
That's how long forever feels.

45
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,379
And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die and nothing will ever change again.

46
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,319
Our videos induce existential dread in many people,

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,879
and the last few minutes probably haven't helped.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,379
So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things:

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,759
an unscientific, subjective point of view, the philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want.

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,539
Please take it with a grain of salt; we don't know any more about human existence than you do.

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,779
We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism.

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,879
What do we mean by that?

53
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,239
Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,979
In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us.

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,439
We became self-aware only to realize this story is not about us.

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,999
While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell,

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,619
Science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing.

58
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,659
Okay, but so what?

59
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,279
You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,579
If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten.

61
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,699
Every mistake you made will not matter in the end.

62
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,599
Every bad thing you did will be voided.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,459
If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters.

64
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,579
If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on.

65
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,239
If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,039
Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point,

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,559
but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us.

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,959
We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other.

69
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,919
The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible.

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,839
It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true.

71
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,779
We are as much the universe as a neutron star

72
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,979
or a black hole or a nebula.

73
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,459
Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part:

74
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,059
the centre organs of the universe.

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,439
We are truly free in a universe-sized playground,

76
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,399
so we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,399
It's not as if we've found out everything there is to know

78
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,139
We don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are,

79
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,539
how life came into existence, what life is.

80
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,559
We have no idea what consciousness is or if we are alone in the universe.

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,539
But we can try to find some answers.

82
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,979
There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure,

83
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,919
people to help, happy feelings to be experienced,

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,899
and video games to finish.

85
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,159
There is so much to do.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,939
So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you.

87
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,039
If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,459
and live as happy as possible.

89
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,399
Bonus points if you made the life of other people better.

90
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,679
More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire.

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,319
Do the things that make you feel good.

92
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,500
You get to decide whatever this means for you.
