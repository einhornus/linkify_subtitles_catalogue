1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,299
In the year 1014, Byzantine Emperor Basil the Second defeated the Bulgarian army and captured 15 thousand prisoners.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,119
He could've killed them, but he had a different idea.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,759
He wanted to weaken his opponents for decades to come.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,079
So he ordered that 99 out of every 100 prisoners be blinded.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,299
The 100th to be spared one eye to guide the rest back home,

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,419
forcing their communities to care for them for the rest of their lives.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:39,059
Today, humans are subject to an attack just as cynical as this by a league of supervillians called NTDs.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:47,299
One in seven humans on the planet suffers from one or more NTDs, more than the entire population of Europe.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,499
They do unimaginable damage, by crippling countless people,

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,479
they destroy billions of dollars in income each year, weaken communities, and slow progress.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:12,439
What are these monsters straight out of a horror movie, seeking to wreak havoc on our species?

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,779
NTDs are caused by a vast range of different parasites such as worms, amoebae, bacteria, or viruses.

13
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,979
The symptoms they cause are just as diverse and truly the stuff of nightmares.

14
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,319
Some, like hookworms, compete with children's brains and bodies for nutrition,

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,799
stunting growth, and impairing intelligence.

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,119
Some NTDs cause blindness as the result of awful eye infections.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,759
Other parasites confine patients to bed for months, and damage internal organs, often shortening lifespans drastically.

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,259
Yet others cause horrible disfigurements that lead to social stigma, a life lived in shame, and unemployment.

19
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:58,759
There are also a few that are incredibly agonizing. They cause continuous itching, or horrible pain.

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,839
In fact, let's introduce you to one of them: Dracun culiasis.

21
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,379
If you accidentally drink water infected by it, you won't notice anything for a year.

22
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,459
Until one day, you suddenly see a blister on your leg.

23
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,239
The worm breaks out of the skin to release new larvae.

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:23,879
The only way to remove it is to slowly pull it out of your leg, centimeter by centimeter, over the course of several weeks,

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,159
because Dracun culiasis is now up to a meter long.

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,159
We can all agree that we should kill such parasites with fire.

27
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,539
That's why we declared war on them, pleading to eradicate most of them by 2020, and we tried doing that very hard.

28
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,519
In 1985, there were 3.5 million cases of Dracun culiasis all over the world.

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,679
In 2015, there were 22.

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,459
We killed 99.999% of these little monsters.

31
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,279
It will be the first parasite we eradicate for good very soon.

32
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,779
So, even if they don't generate big headlines like Ebola did, actually, amazing things have happened when it comes to NTDs.

33
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,419
All NTDs have one thing in common:

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,379
they preferably attack humans who live in the most isolated communities, and who are least able to defend themselves.

35
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,559
There are villages that are 500 kilometers from the nearest health facility, with no roads anywhere.

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,639
So even if a remedy is available, what if it means going on an odyssey to get it to the patients?

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,159
This called for an attack using brute force.

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,639
To stamp out NTDs once and for all, what's possibly the biggest medical program in human history was launched, unmatched in scale.

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,619
Organizations from all fields are working together right now to eliminate ten of these NTDs forever.

40
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,779
Ironically, every NTD is, in fact, preventable or treatable.

41
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,179
But most of them can only be controlled by giving medicine to every person in all high-risk areas.

42
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:03,499
That means millions and millions of doses of medicine, often for several NTDs at a time, over the course of years, in countries where there is no infrastructure.

43
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,359
Governments and health organizations just couldn't do that by themselves.

44
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,439
Here, humanity got an opportunity to show off what the industrialized production of medicine can achieve.

45
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:23,859
The pharma industry stepped in to distribute the necessary drugs for free, and promised to keep doing it until those ten diseases are gone.

46
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:31,819
By 2020, nearly $18 billion worth of drugs will have been distributed, the largest drug donation the world has ever seen.

47
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,619
They also helped make sure the drugs actually get to where they're needed.

48
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:46,479
In 2015 alone, these treatments reached over 850 million people, more than the population of the EU and the US combined.

49
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,619
Bad things happening generates headlines.

50
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:56,619
Hundreds of millions of people overcoming extremely destructive diseases, in an unprecedented act of cooperation doesn't.

51
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,539
Stories like this one are not told often enough.

52
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:05,619
Good things happen all the time, moving humanity closer to a future with no suffering.

53
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,019
So, if you or one of your friends are in need of uplifting news, share this video with them.

54
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,039
We, as a species, really can do great things with no other motivation than to help each other.

55
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,459
It's good to remember that from time to time.
