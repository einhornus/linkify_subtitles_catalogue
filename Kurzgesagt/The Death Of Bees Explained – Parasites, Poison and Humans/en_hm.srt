1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:03,533
Human society is extremely
complex and fragile,

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:05,611
built upon various pillars.

3
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:07,634
One of them is the honey bee.

4
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:12,288
One out of three meals eaten by humans
is made possible by honey bees.

5
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:15,970
They are so important that if all the
honey bees were to die out,

6
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:17,903
thousands of plants would follow,

7
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:21,548
which could lead to millions of people
starving in the following years.

8
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:24,955
On top of that, honey bees have
a huge economic impact.

9
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:27,693
The dollar value of plants
pollinated by them each year

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,458
is around $265 billion.

11
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:33,482
Food we take for granted would just
stop existing without them,

12
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:36,454
or there would be a massive
decrease in productivity.

13
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:40,648
Food including apples, onions, pumpkins,
and also plants used for feeding livestock

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,647
and thus extremely important
for our milk and meat.

15
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,781
Einstein is often quoted as having said,

16
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:50,026
“If honey bees die out, humans
will follow a few years later.”

17
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:51,784
Actually, he probably didn’t say that,

18
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,371
but there might be some
truth in the statement.

19
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:58,042
It’s unsettling, but honey bees
have started to disappear.

20
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:01,049
Millions of hives have died
in the last few years.

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,201
Beekeepers all over the world have seen an
annual loss of 30–90% of their colonies.

22
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:10,559
In the US alone, bees
are steadily declining.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,998
>From 5 million hives in 1988
to 2.5 million today.

24
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:19,239
Since 2006, a phenomenon called
“colony collapse disorder”

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,886
has affected honey bees in many countries.

26
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:24,680
And we’re not entirely sure
what’s causing it.

27
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:34,114
All we know is that it’s pretty serious.

28
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:38,838
Over the last few decades bees have seen
an invasion of very dangerous foes.

29
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:42,675
Parasites straight out of a horror movie,
like Acarapis woodi,

30
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:48,263
microscopic mites that infect the tracheae
(that’s the breathing tubes) of bees.

31
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:51,740
Here, they lay their eggs and feed from
the fluids of their victims,

32
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:56,304
weakening them considerably and spending
their whole life inside the bees.

33
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:00,447
Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name
because they can only reproduce

34
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:04,059
in honey bee hives and are one of
the bees’ greatest enemies.

35
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,629
The female mite enters a honey bee brood
cell and lays eggs on the bee larva

36
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,441
before it’s about to pupate and

37
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:13,515
before the hive bees cover the
cell with a wax capping.

38
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:17,665
The eggs hatch and the young mites and
their mother feed on the developing bee

39
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,729
in the safety of the capped cell.

40
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,739
The bee is not normally killed
at this stage, just weakened,

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,932
so it still has enough strength to chew
its way through the wax capping

42
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,972
and release itself from the cell.

43
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:31,804
As it does, it releases the mother mite
and her new offspring from the cell,

44
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:34,072
and these are free to
spread across the hive,

45
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:38,151
starting the process over again
in a cycle of about 10 days.

46
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:41,416
Their numbers grow exponentially,
and after a few months,

47
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:44,546
this can lead to the collapse
of the entire bee hive.

48
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:48,874
Once outside of the cell, adult mites
also suck the bodily fludis of bees

49
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,044
and weaken them considerably.

50
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:55,255
To make things worse, they also transmit
viruses that harm the bees even more

51
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:58,550
and can lead to birth defects
like useless wings.

52
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:02,763
But there are other threats too,
such as viruses and fungi.

53
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:06,101
Under normal circumstances, these
phenomena should be manageable

54
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,019
and are not enough to explain

55
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,076
the horrendous amount of
dying going on in bees.

56
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:14,391
Over recent years new insecticides
have been introduced

57
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:16,055
that are deadly to bees.

58
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:19,654
Neonicotinoids, a chemical family
similar to nicotine,

59
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:24,548
was approved in the early 1990s
as an alternative to chemicals like DDT.

60
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,508
They attack insects by harming
their nervous systems.

61
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,476
Today, they are the most widely
used insecticides in the world.

62
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:35,427
Globally, they saw sales
of €1.5 billion in 2008,

63
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:39,470
representing 24% of the global
market for insecticides.

64
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:46,084
In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the
US on about 95% of corn and canola crops,

65
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,995
and also on the vast majority
of fruit and vegetables,

66
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:55,739
like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges,
berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes,

67
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,386
cereal grains, rice, nuts,
grapes, and many more.

68
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,294
Bees come into contact with the toxin

69
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:05,190
while collecting pollen or
via contaminated water,

70
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,280
often bringing material into the hive,

71
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,716
where it can accumulate and
slowly kill the whole colony.

72
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,766
The toxins harm bees in a
variety of horrible ways.

73
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:19,424
In high enough doses, it quickly leads
to convulsions, paralysis, and death.

74
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,653
But even in small doses, it can be fatal.

75
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:24,689
It may lead to bees forgetting
how to navigate the world,

76
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,204
so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and
die alone, separated from their hives.

77
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:34,831
If this happens often enough, a hive
can lose its ability to sustain itself.

78
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:37,838
We know that neonicotinoids
are harmful to bees

79
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,117
and that we urgently need
an alternative to it,

80
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:44,455
but there are billions of dollars
to be made in delaying this.

81
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:47,742
Studies sponsored by the chemical
industry magically appear to prove

82
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,047
a much lower toxicity to bees, compared to
those produced by independent scientists.

83
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:56,396
There are even more factors
contributing to the demise of bees,

84
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:59,421
like too much genetic uniformity,
crop monocultures,

85
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:03,484
poor nutrition due to overcrowding,
stress because of human activities,

86
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:04,966
and other pesticides.

87
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:08,334
Each of those factors on its own is
a major problem for bees,

88
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:12,796
but together, they probably account
for colony collapse disorder.

89
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:15,307
With parasites upping their
game in recent decades,

90
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:18,413
the honey bees are now
fighting for survival.

91
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:21,521
It would be a catastrophe
if they lost this fight.

92
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:25,617
This is a conundrum we have to solve
if we want to continue living

93
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,956
with a relative abundance
and diversity of food.

94
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:33,399
Humanity is deeply interconnected with
Earth and the other lifeforms on it,

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,820
even if we pretend that we’re not.

96
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:37,881
We have to take better care
of our surroundings,

97
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:43,697
if not to preserve the beauty of nature,
then at least to ensure our own survival.
