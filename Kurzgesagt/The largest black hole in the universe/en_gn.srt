1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,799
the largest things in the universe are

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,999
black holes

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,079
in contrast to things like planets or

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,358
stars they have no

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,759
physical size limit and can literally

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,119
grow endlessly

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,359
although in reality specific things need

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,119
to happen to create different kinds of

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,198
black holes from really tiny ones

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,278
to the largest single things in the

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,399
universe

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,159
so how do black holes grow and how large

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,840
is the largest of them all

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,479
this video will not discuss how black

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,319
holes work or how they form

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,159
since we've looked at that in detail in

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,479
our black hole and neutron star series

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,558
you can check them out afterwards for

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,238
now we're interested in finding the

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,558
largest thing in the universe

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,679
let's start really really small

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,878
primordial black holes the smallest kind

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,319
of black holes may or

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,718
may not exist if they do they're

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,479
probably the oldest objects in the

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,198
universe

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,839
older even than atoms they would have

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,839
formed just after the big bang

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,679
when the universe was so dense with

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,919
violent energy that any tiny pocket that

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,679
was just slightly more dense than its

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,239
neighbors

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,199
could produce a black hole the smallest

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,798
primordial black hole that could still

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,039
be around would be a trillion kilograms

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,599
or so

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,399
the mass of a big mountain and yet they

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,879
would be no bigger than a proton

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,959
a primordial black hole with the mass of

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,599
earth would barely be larger than a coin

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,839
this makes them very hard to find so we

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,239
haven't actually observed any yet

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,399
if they exist they may even be the

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,999
mysterious dark matter

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,199
that holds galaxies together let's move

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,039
on to the kinds of black holes that we

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,999
know for sure

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,720
are out there stellar black holes

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,798
to make a black hole we need to compress

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,039
enough matter so that it collapses into

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,639
itself after that

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,798
the more mass we throw at it the larger

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,158
it becomes

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,158
in today's universe only the most

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,078
violent cosmic events can create the

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,279
necessary conditions

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,359
such as the merger of neutron stars or

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,118
when the core of a very massive star

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,118
collapses in a supernova

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,199
to have a unit to work with here we'll

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,799
use the mass of our sun

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,039
about 2 million trillion trillion

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,719
kilograms

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,598
the smallest known black hole has 2.7

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,878
times the mass of the sun

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,279
which works out as a sphere around 16

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,639
kilometers in diameter

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,519
large enough to cover paris another

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,519
lightweight black hole is the companion

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,119
to the v723

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,799
mon red giant star this star is 24 times

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,159
larger than our sun

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,799
30 million kilometers in diameter and

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,199
yet

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,598
it's thrown around by a tiny black hole

76
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,639
just 17.2 kilometers wide

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,279
this tiny thing bullying the star is so

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,279
much smaller that we can barely even

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,279
show them in comparison

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,199
one of the largest known stellar black

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,999
holes is m33x7

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,719
it currently spends its time eating a 70

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,238
solar mass blue giant

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,039
bit by bit as all that stolen matter

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,639
circles towards the black hole

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,878
like water going down a drain friction

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,559
heats it up to temperatures high enough

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,119
to shine

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,399
500 000 times brighter than our sun

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,199
and yet x7 is only 15.65 solar masses

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,999
and 92 kilometers wide just big enough

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,878
to cast a shadow on corsica

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,279
to grow much larger black holes have to

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,039
either devour a lot of stars

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,999
or better merge with one another the

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,598
instruments that make it possible to

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:31,999
detect

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,079
these mergers are very new so we're

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,238
currently discovering a lot of exciting

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,359
things

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,199
like two massive black holes that we

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,679
detected in a galaxy 17 billion light

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,958
years away

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,199
as they spun around each other violently

105
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,079
they released more

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,839
energy in the form of gravitational

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,839
waves than the combined light from all

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,518
the stars in the milky way

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,518
in 4400 years the new black hole they

110
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:55,999
formed

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,598
is about the size of germany and is 142

112
00:03:59,599 --> 00:03:59,999
solar

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,359
masses and here we hit a curious

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,919
gap in scale there are lots of black

115
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,479
holes

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,679
up to 150 solar masses and then

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,238
there's nothing for a long time until we

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,318
suddenly hit black holes that are

119
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,559
millions of times more massive

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,559
which is a bit confusing because we had

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,398
this idea that black holes are

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,879
consistently growing and growing

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,799
but for the most massive black holes

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,879
this process is not fast enough to

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,879
explain their existence today

126
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,799
the universe is simply not old enough

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,478
for these supermassive black holes to

128
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,159
have formed by eating stars

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,079
and merging with each other something

130
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,679
else must have happened

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,758
to explain how we got the largest black

132
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,959
holes in the universe

133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,119
we might need the largest stars that

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,359
ever existed

135
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,439
quasi-stars to get a sense of scale we

136
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,279
can compare them to the largest stars

137
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,719
that exist today

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,679
our sun is like a grain of sand next to

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,638
them

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,959
we don't know if quasi stars actually

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,679
existed

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,519
but they're an interesting concept when

143
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,359
it comes to supercharging black hole

144
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,638
development

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,399
the idea is that the matter in the early

146
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,918
universe was so dense

147
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,079
that quasi-stars could grow to thousands

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,399
of times the mass of our sun

149
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,239
the cores of these stars might have been

150
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,599
crushed by their own weight

151
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,999
so much to actually collapse into black

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,719
holes while the star was still forming

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,638
in contrast to stars today that would

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,399
destroy themselves in the process

155
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,119
inside stars a deadly balance could

156
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,079
emerge

157
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,159
gravity pressed the supermassive star

158
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,839
together feeding the black hole

159
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,679
and heating the material falling in to

160
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,279
such a degree that the radiation

161
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,439
pressure kept the star stable

162
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,679
and so these quickly growing black holes

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,119
might have been able to consume the

164
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,119
quasi-star for millions of years

165
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,198
and grow far bigger than any modern

166
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,879
stellar black hole

167
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,119
black holes several thousand times the

168
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,159
mass of the sun

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,119
and wider than the entire earth these

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,279
black holes might have become the seeds

171
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,679
for

172
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,279
supermassive black holes so now

173
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,918
we arrive at the kings of our universe

174
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,719
the largest

175
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,839
single bodies in existence the centers

176
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,159
of most galaxies contain a supermassive

177
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,879
black hole

178
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,318
and they are monstrous in the milky way

179
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,559
we have sagittarius a-star a

180
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,719
supermassive black hole with about four

181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,959
million solar masses that is calm

182
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,758
and collected and just does its thing we

183
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:19,999
know

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,599
it sits there because we can see a

185
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,839
number of stars being thrown around by a

186
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,918
seemingly empty spot

187
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,239
and despite its incredible mess its

188
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,439
radius is still

189
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,359
only 17 times our sun smaller than most

190
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,399
giant stars

191
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,679
but millions of times more massive

192
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,999
because supermassive black holes are so

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,839
massive and located at the center of

194
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,478
galaxies

195
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,239
many people imagine them as being a bit

196
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,478
like the sun in the solar system

197
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,159
an anchor that glues everything else

198
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,598
together and forces it

199
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,279
into an orbit but this is a

200
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,959
misconception

201
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,239
while the sun makes up 99.86 percent of

202
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,959
all the mass

203
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,119
in the solar system supermassive black

204
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,638
holes usually only have

205
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,999
0.001 percent of the mass of their

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,119
galaxy

207
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,439
the billions of stars in galaxies are

208
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,359
not gravitationally bound to them

209
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,758
instead it's the gravitational effect of

210
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,638
dark matter which holds them together

211
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,799
many supermassive black holes aren't

212
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,839
gentle giants

213
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,359
especially when they're feeding on the

214
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,758
clouds of mass in their galaxy

215
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,758
the one at the center of the bl lucerti

216
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,239
galaxy is devouring so much material

217
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,159
that it produces jets of plasma

218
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,638
accelerated to nearly the speed of light

219
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,959
if earth were orbiting this huge body it

220
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,399
would seem 115 times larger than our sun

221
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,119
in the sky

222
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,359
and we'd be burnt to a crisp in seconds

223
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,918
by its glowing hot accretion disk

224
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,159
at this point black holes become so

225
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,359
large that stars

226
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,478
seem ridiculously tiny compared to them

227
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,359
the galaxy cygnus a has a supermassive

228
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,519
black hole with 2.5 billion

229
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,038
solar masses and 14.7 billion kilometers

230
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:57,439
wide

231
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,719
which would mean that if it took the

232
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,799
place of our sun it would swallow all

233
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,519
the planets

234
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,519
and stretch halfway to the edge of our

235
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,038
solar system

236
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,999
it's devouring so much mass and material

237
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,079
that it turns its disk into a kind of

238
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,359
magnetic funnel

239
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,079
spewing gas out making tremendous radio

240
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,638
lobes

241
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,959
towering over the galaxy half a million

242
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,038
light years in diameter

243
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,719
that's two and a half milky ways wide

244
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,799
another pretty large supermassive black

245
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,478
hole sits in the galaxy

246
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,239
messier 87 it has 6.5 billion solar

247
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,478
masses and was the first black hole we

248
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,158
got an actual photo of

249
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,119
or rather of the glowing gas around the

250
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,678
edge of a menacing shadow

251
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,558
this sphere of darkness is so large that

252
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,518
it covers our entire solar system

253
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,319
and yet there is a scale even above

254
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,639
these kinds of objects

255
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,518
ultramassive black holes

256
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,679
now we reach the most massive black

257
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,919
holes perhaps the largest single bodies

258
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,838
that will ever exist

259
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,838
these black holes have eaten so much

260
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,759
that they've grown to tens of billions

261
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,879
of solar masses

262
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,599
their gravity the engine for a quasar an

263
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,479
accretion disk

264
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,159
shining brighter than thousands of

265
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,079
galaxies full of stars

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,239
so massive that they deserve a title of

267
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,199
their own

268
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,319
ultra massive black holes the ultra

269
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,919
massive black hole at the center of

270
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,919
galaxy oj287

271
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,838
is 18 billion solar masses it's so big

272
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,159
that it has a supermassive black hole

273
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,479
nearly 40 times larger than sagittarius

274
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,119
a-star

275
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,599
orbiting it this thing defies

276
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,479
imagination

277
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,239
and is really hard to compare to

278
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,958
anything it can comfortably fit three

279
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,919
solar systems

280
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,278
side by side inside of it let's end

281
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,759
this insane competition and get to the

282
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,039
king of kings

283
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,159
ton 618 a black hole that we can observe

284
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,559
consuming galaxies worth of matter is

285
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,639
shining with the brightness of a hundred

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,518
trillion stars visible from 18 billion

287
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,039
light years away

288
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,239
it has an incredible 66 billion solar

289
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,039
masses

290
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,359
a black hole so large that it would take

291
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,599
light a week to reach the singularity

292
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,999
after crossing the event horizon about

293
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,559
11 solar systems could sit inside of it

294
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,518
side by side it may very well be the

295
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,078
largest

296
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,159
single body in the universe but in

297
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,278
reality it's probably even larger

298
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,398
since tun 618 is so far away we only see

299
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,518
what it looked like

300
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,559
10 billion years ago in any case

301
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,759
black holes are scary and mysterious

302
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,958
and gigantic they'll be here after

303
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,239
everything else dies

304
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,999
and growing larger and larger okay

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,559
now let's do the trip again from the

306
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,479
smallest possible black hole

307
00:10:46,480 --> 00:11:01,839
all the way up to the largest

[Music]

310
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,999
let's try something new today we can

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,838
call this behind the lies

312
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,999
a short behind-the-scenes bit about the

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,319
necessary inaccuracies in this video

314
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,919
because it's not really actually

315
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,078
possible to rank black holes like

316
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,439
trading cards how so well while we've

317
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,359
cataloged millions of stars

318
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,119
we really only have good data on a

319
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,119
couple of dozen black holes

320
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,119
that's because black hole gazing wasn't

321
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,039
really a thing until 50 years ago

322
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,879
and technically still isn't because we

323
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,398
can't see black holes

324
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,239
we can only derive their properties from

325
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,919
studying their gravitational effects on

326
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,958
the matter around them

327
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,799
like the orbit of stars that come close

328
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,439
to them this effect depends on the mass

329
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,719
of the black hole which we can

330
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,799
approximate at the most basic level with

331
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,239
kepler's laws

332
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,398
but this comes with huge uncertainties

333
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,999
and error bars

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,919
then we have to convert mass to size

335
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,719
next which brings new uncertainties

336
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,479
for example we calculated the radius

337
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,239
from the mass using the schwarzschild

338
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,518
equation which for the sake of

339
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,319
simplicity

340
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,638
assumes black holes are perfectly round

341
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,838
and don't spin

342
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,518
a kind of black hole that doesn't really

343
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,559
exist the reality is that physics on

344
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,359
these scales

345
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,078
is a bit fuzzy so some of the black

346
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,919
holes we talked about here may be way

347
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,479
smaller

348
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,479
or way bigger we just don't know for

349
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,278
sure we shimmered around this problem by

350
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,799
comparing different sources with

351
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,239
different kinds of values

352
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,319
and using different mass calculations to

353
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,319
arrive at a standardized list that

354
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,559
allowed us to be as accurate as humanly

355
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,119
possible

356
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,638
you can look at all of this in our

357
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,119
source doc as a result this script was

358
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,958
written with the tears of experts we

359
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,439
drove

360
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,599
crazy with our obsession for the best

361
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,599
values they could live with

362
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,159
in this process tons of stuff got cut

363
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,319
and didn't make it into the final video

364
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,398
but luckily we found a way to not waste

365
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,838
all of it

366
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,239
we've created a lot of black hole merch

367
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,159
spanning the whole range from somewhat

368
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,078
bonkers to more serious

369
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,078
this way we get to explore a topic from

370
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,319
different angles and you get to continue

371
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,999
having fun with black holes

372
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:35,119
