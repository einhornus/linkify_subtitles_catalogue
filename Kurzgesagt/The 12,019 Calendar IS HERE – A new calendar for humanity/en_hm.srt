00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,579
It's the most wonderful time of the year again!

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,179
The 12,019 human era calendar is out.

Go get our new limited edition now or regret it forever.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,539
We heard your comments on last year's edition, so we've updated the design.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,419
Each illustration is now featured on a full page with so much more space to take notes below.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,019
Exactly 2.36689 times as much as in the old layout.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:32,799
Also, the calendar has a spiral binding, shiny silver letters on the cover, and is printed on high quality paper

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,419
that's nice to touch!

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,139
The calendar looks awesome on your wall,

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,019
but it's also the easiest way to tick off your whole present list for Christmas.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,999
If you order now,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,759
it will arrive before the holidays and it's the perfect gift for your friends, kids,

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,919
grandma, doggo, mortal enemies, or random strangers you meet on the street.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,559
On the inside you find 12 brand-new beautiful illustrations of early human

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,679
cultures and craftsmanship prior to the first civilizations and the use of metal.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,239
This topic is endlessly fascinating to us.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,339
Our ancestor's achievements from 10,000 years ago paved the way for our modern civilization,

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,419
so we can only dream of what might be possible in the future through human cooperation.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,799
By the way, if you're wondering about the date, we explained why 12,019

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,859
should be our current year in our A New Calendar for Humanity video.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:25,599
Order your calendar now, it will be available as a limited edition, until our stock is sold out and then never again.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,959
The human calendar is a super fun side project we got to do for the third time thanks to your support!

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,659
We loved getting mails, tweets, and pictures with your calendars from over 80 countries last year.

24
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,539
So we're already looking forward to all your messages.

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,040
