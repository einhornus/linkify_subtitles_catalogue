1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
What would happen to you if
a black hole the size of a coin

2
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,835
suddenly appeared near you?

3
00:00:04,836 --> 00:00:06,350
Short answer: you’d die.

4
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:08,079
Long answer: it depends.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,962
Is it a black hole with
the mass of a coin,

6
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,502
or is it as wide as a coin?

7
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:14,962
Suppose a US nickel with
the mass of about 5 grams

8
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:17,082
magically collapsed into a black hole.

9
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,644
This black hole would have a radius
of about 10 to the power of −30 meters.

10
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:25,464
By comparison, a hydrogen atom is about
10 to the power of −11 meters.

11
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,454
So the black hole compared
to an atom is as small as

12
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:30,214
an atom compared to the Sun.

13
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:31,884
Unimaginably small!

14
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:35,674
And a small black hole would also have
an unimaginably short lifetime

15
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:37,284
to decay by Hawking radiation.

16
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:42,454
It would radiate away what little mass it
has in 10 to the power of −23 seconds.

17
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:47,224
Its 5 grams of mass will be converted
to 450 terajoules of energy,

18
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:50,245
which will lead to an explosion
roughly 3 times bigger than

19
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:53,626
the atomic bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.

20
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:55,096
In this case, you die.

21
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,091
You also lose the coin.

22
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,879
If the black hole had the
diameter of a common coin,

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,132
then it would be considerably
more massive.

24
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:05,264
In fact, a black hole with
the diameter of a nickel

25
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,474
would be slightly more
massive than the Earth.

26
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:11,194
It would have a surface gravity
a billion billion times greater

27
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,894
than our planet currently does.

28
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:15,482
Its tidal forces on you would be so strong

29
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:18,322
that they’d rip your
individual cells apart.

30
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:22,392
The black hole would consume you before
you even realized what’s happening.

31
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:24,656
Although the laws of gravity
are still the same,

32
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:28,006
the phenomenon of gravity that you’d
experience would be very different

33
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:29,869
around such dense objects.

34
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,701
The range of the gravitational attraction

35
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:33,971
extends over the entire
observable universe,

36
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:37,171
with gravity getting weaker the farther
away you are from something.

37
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:41,661
On Earth right now, your head and your
toes are approximately the same distance

38
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,121
from the center of our planet.

39
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:45,691
But if you stood on
a nickel-sized black hole,

40
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:48,481
your feet would be hundreds
of times closer to the center,

41
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:52,230
and the gravitational force would be
tens of thousands of times as large

42
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:55,680
as the force on your head and
rip you into a billion pieces.

43
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,170
But the black hole wouldn’t
stop with just you.

44
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:01,460
The black hole is now a
dominant gravitational piece

45
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:04,050
of the
Earth–Moon–Black-Hole-of-Death system.

46
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,760
You might think that the black hole would
sink towards the center of the planet

47
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,100
and consume it from the inside out.

48
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:14,630
In fact, the Earth also moves up onto
the black hole and begins to bob around,

49
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,330
as if it were orbiting the black hole,

50
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:19,070
all while having swathes of
mass eaten with each pass,

51
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,048
which is much more creepy.

52
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,558
As the Earth is eaten up from the inside,

53
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,098
it collapses into a
scattered disk of hot rock,

54
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,358
surrounding the black hole
in a tight orbit.

55
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,858
The black hole slowly doubles its mass
by the time it’s done feeding.

56
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,808
The Moon’s orbit is now highly elliptical.

57
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:37,288
The effects on the Solar system
are awesome—

58
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:41,297
in the Biblical sense of awesome,
which means terrifying.

59
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:45,057
Tidal forces from the black hole would
probably disrupt the near-Earth asteroids,

60
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:47,419
maybe even parts of the asteroid belt,

61
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,846
sending rocks careening
through the Solar system.

62
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:52,676
Bombardment and impacts
may become commonplace

63
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:54,156
for the next few million years.

64
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:58,156
The planets are slightly perturbed, but
stay approximately in the same orbit.

65
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,856
The black hole we used
to call Earth will now

66
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:03,362
continue on orbiting
the Sun in the Earth’s place.

67
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:07,933
In this case, you also die.
