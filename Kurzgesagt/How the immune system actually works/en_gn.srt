1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,959
the human immune system is the most

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,679
complex biological system we know after

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,799
the human brain and yet most of us never

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,718
learn how it works or what it is

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,718
your immune system consists of hundreds

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,839
of tiny and two large organs it has its

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,839
own transport network spread throughout

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,479
your body every day it makes hundreds of

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,719
billions of fresh cells organized like

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,438
an army with soldiers captains

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,079
intelligence officers heavy weapons and

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,478
crazy suicide bombers

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,119
it's not some sort of abstract entity

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,999
your immune system is you

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,078
your biology protecting you from the

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,999
billions of microorganisms that want to

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,479
consume you and from your own perverted

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,878
cells that turn into cancer

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,038
it's so manifold that it's impossible to

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,959
cover in one video so we'll make a

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,799
series looking at different aspects of

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,238
it

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,479
today what happens when your body is

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,279
invaded and your first lines of defenses

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,759
are engaged in a fight for life and

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,079
death

27
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,599
[Music]

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,399
it's been a normal day when suddenly the

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,118
world explodes and an asteroid rips the

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,639
sky open

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,359
countless alien life forms invade ready

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,999
to destroy cities and infrastructure and

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,199
eat civilians or this is what your cells

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,879
experience

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,879
you look at your bleeding thumb that you

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,919
just cut on a dirty twig in the park

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,438
how annoying

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,519
but inside the wound a horrible

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,599
catastrophe has happened

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,758
there are dead cells and blood and dirt

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,879
everywhere

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,839
even worse countless bacteria invade the

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,239
warm caverns between your helpless cells

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,639
to explore their new home steal your

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,279
resources and poop everywhere

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,519
immediately the first stage of your

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,919
defense kicks in

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,078
the cells that survived the impact or

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,639
are hurt or dying scream in panic

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,798
releasing an onslaught of chemical alarm

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,599
signals that awaken your immune system

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,678
the first cells to show up are

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,279
macrophages

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,359
if an average cell with the size of a

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,159
human a macrophage would be the size of

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,919
a black rhino a stoic cell in principle

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,318
but you wouldn't want to annoy it

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,359
bacteria do annoy them

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,839
within seconds the large cells attack

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,559
and begin killing them without mercy

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,559
they stretch out parts like the arms of

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,719
an octopus and grab the bacteria to

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,999
swallow them whole and digest them alive

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,878
a macrophage can eat 100 bacteria before

65
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,318
it's exhausted

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,799
but there are too many enemies so the

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,759
macrophages call for reinforcements

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,679
in your blood hundreds of thousands of

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,919
neutrophils pick up their signals and

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,839
move to the battlefield

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,639
neutrophils are intense suicide warriors

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,559
that only live to kill

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,878
they're so enthusiastic about killing

74
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,958
that they kill themselves a few days

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,119
after birth so they don't have time to

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,039
accidentally destroy your body from the

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,639
inside

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,039
as soon as neutrophils arrive they begin

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,598
vomiting deadly chemicals of bacteria or

80
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,039
devour them

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,199
they are so careless in their attacks

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,039
that they are causing real damage to

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,518
your own cells but collateral damage is

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,518
not their concern now

85
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,039
or ever

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,199
some neutrophils go so far to push their

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,639
suicide button and explode casting wide

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,839
and toxic nets made from their own dna

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,079
filled with deadly chemicals that trap

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,399
and kill bacteria

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,479
sometimes they can continue fighting

92
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,479
after that even though they're sort of

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,719
dead already this is how much fun they

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,399
have killing

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,318
while the battle rages your blood

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,079
vessels let fluid stream into the

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,079
battlefield like a dam opening up

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,679
towards a valley

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,158
you notice this as inflammation your

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,079
thumb swells up a little and gets red

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,199
and warm

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,359
the fluid brings a silent killer into

103
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,438
the battle zone millions of complement

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,919
proteins a sort of automated liquid

105
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,479
weapon that stuns and kills bacteria by

106
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,639
ripping holes into them we made a whole

107
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,598
video explaining them in detail

108
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,159
we're reaching a crossroad now if things

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,477
go well your first line of defense kills

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,278
the invaders quickly but sometimes the

111
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,198
enemies are too strong and would

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,279
overwhelm your defenses eventually which

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,719
means certain death for you the human

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,198
this is the hour of the dendritic cell

115
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,198
your immune system's intelligence

116
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,599
officer while your soldiers were bashing

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,399
in heads it was collecting samples by

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,719
ripping bacteria into tiny parts and

119
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,638
covering itself in it

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,799
like a soldier decorating itself in the

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,119
guts of a dead enemy

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,039
the cell leaves the battlefield and

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,959
enters the superhighway of your immune

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,879
system that connects all your tissues

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,519
with your immune headquarters your lymph

126
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,039
nodes

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,638
the dendritic cell coming from the

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,799
battlefield is looking for a helper t

129
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,799
cell which is a sort of all-purpose

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,679
commander cell within your immune army

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,918
but not any helper t cell one that

132
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,758
happens to have just the right weapon

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,599
for the bacteria that infected your

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,719
wound

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,119
so it goes around and rubs itself still

136
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,359
covered in bacteria parts against every

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,758
helper t-cell it meets

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,319
most t-cells are a bit disgusted and not

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,879
interested but after a few hours

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,399
something clicks

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,879
a helper t cell recognizes the bacteria

142
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,999
parts

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,159
this cell is the weapon that's needed

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,359
right now

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,519
the dendritic cell is overjoyed and

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,758
activates the helper t cell okay wait

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,079
how come your immune system has a cell

148
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,918
that has a weapon against the specific

149
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,319
bacteria that infected you

150
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,638
well your immune system has a perfect

151
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,638
weapon against every possible disease in

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,879
the universe against the black death the

153
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,198
coronavirus or an infection that will

154
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,839
emerge in 100 years on mars

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,599
we'll talk about this a bit more in the

156
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,999
next video because it's very complex so

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,239
for now just know that you have billions

158
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,638
of unique helper t-cells that each have

159
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,999
weapons against every possible enemy

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,478
after the right t-cell is activated your

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,879
second line of defense awakes and rises

162
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,038
like a teenager that needs to get up on

163
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,559
a school day very slowly your heavy

164
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,038
weapons are incredibly effective but

165
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,119
they're not fast

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,359
the activated helper t cell begins to

167
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,079
clone itself over and over again

168
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,559
one becomes two two become four until

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,799
there are thousands of them now they

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,638
split into two groups

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,719
the first group quickly moves to help

172
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,399
out your soldiers

173
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,318
at the battlefield things are getting

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,519
out of hand

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,318
a tired macrophage is ready to give up

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,399
after fighting for days it just wants to

177
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,478
go to sleep like many of its buddies

178
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,239
have done already

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,119
but now the helper t cells arrive one of

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,279
them comes to the tired macrophage and

181
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,119
whispers something using special

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,799
chemical signals

183
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,279
in a heartbeat the demoralized soldier

184
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,119
feels fresh again

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,079
but there's something else a hot white

186
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,198
anger the macrophage knows what it needs

187
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,478
to do

188
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,679
kill

189
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,318
invigorated it throws itself against the

190
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,159
enemies once again

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,399
all over the battlefield this begins to

192
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,598
happen

193
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,758
meanwhile the second group of helper t

194
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,918
cells was working on activating another

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,839
line of defense b cells your antibody

196
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,918
factories antibodies are protein super

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,999
weapons that look like tiny crabs with

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,239
two pincers to grab enemies

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,318
just like the helper t cells there are b

200
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,079
cells in your body that are able to make

201
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,918
just the right antibodies for every

202
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,439
possible enemy

203
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,439
and the helper t cell is looking for

204
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,758
exactly these b cells

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,079
after a day or two the right b cell is

206
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,638
found and begins to clone itself

207
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,799
as soon as enough clones have been made

208
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,679
each b-cell begins pumping out up to 2

209
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,559
000 antibodies per second about a week

210
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,719
after you injured yourself and bacteria

211
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,878
invaded your second line of defense

212
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,519
finally arrives in full force

213
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,439
the tiny army begins to saturate the

214
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,598
battlefield pinching and stunning

215
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,598
desperate bacteria

216
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,598
the antibodies clump them together and

217
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,159
make them unable to move or fight while

218
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,159
your soldiers massacre the defenseless

219
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,439
victims

220
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,999
the tide is turning fast

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,399
as the last enemies are cleaned up your

222
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,079
soldiers realize they are no longer

223
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,159
needed and begin to kill themselves to

224
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,918
save resources

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,558
but not all of them a few helper t cells

226
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,759
remain and turn into memory cells

227
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,918
they will guard the tissue for years

228
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,158
making sure the same bacteria will never

229
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,479
again gain a foothold here

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,119
similarly a few b-cells will stay alive

231
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,958
and keep producing a low amount of

232
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,119
antibodies making you immune against

233
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,518
this bacteria maybe for the rest of your

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,799
life

235
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,879
one day you wake up and notice that the

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,199
wound has grown over and left nothing

237
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,199
but a faint red mark

238
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,359
you were completely unaware of the drama

239
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,518
yourselves had to deal with

240
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,679
for you the whole ordeal was a slight

241
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,559
annoyance while for millions of cells it

242
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,440
was a desperate fight for life and death

243
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,599
but this is just the beginning of the

244
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,838
epic story that unfolds inside you every

245
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,958
day and is told in full in immune a

246
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,799
journey into the mysterious system that

247
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,199
keeps you alive written by philip detmer

248
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,599
the founder and head writer of kotzkozak

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,359
the book is a beautifully illustrated

250
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,599
deep dive into the immune system the

251
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,119
most important thing you don't know

252
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,039
enough about that will forever change

253
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,039
how you think about your body

254
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,639
written to be as simple and fun as

255
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,559
possible it's been an ongoing passion

256
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,559
project for almost a decade because the

257
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,479
immune system is just about the most

258
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,359
amazing and fascinating topic there is

259
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,919
so go on a journey and get to know your

260
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,398
own body from mystery organs murder

261
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,639
universities to the largest library in

262
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,919
the universe

263
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,239
explore how incredibly vast your immune

264
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,799
system is and how it actually works how

265
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,759
it fights enemies from cancer to hiv or

266
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,039
just the flu

267
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,039
learn how you can boost it and if that's

268
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,039
actually a good idea

269
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,958
the book will be out in six weeks and it

270
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,958
would mean the world to us and philip if

271
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,599
you could pre-order it pre-ordering is

272
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,518
super important in the world of books

273
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,759
and in contrast to games we can

274
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,759
guarantee that it's actually finished

275
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,398
and there will be no day one patch

276
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,719
there's a link in the description

277
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,398
this is the end of a decade-long

278
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,479
personal journey and we'd love to see

279
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,838
what you think

280
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,399
thank you for watching
