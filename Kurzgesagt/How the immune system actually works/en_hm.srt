1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,720
The human immune system is the most complex
biological system we know, after the human brain,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,190
and yet most of us never learn how it works.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,010
Or, what it is.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,330
Your immune system consists
of hundreds of tiny—and two large—organs.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,704
It has its own transport network
spread throughout your body.

6
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:25,430
Every day, it makes hundreds of billions
of fresh cells organized like an army.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,910
With soldiers, captains, intelligence officers,
heavy weapons, and crazy suicide bombers.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,120
It's not some sort of abstract entity.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,340
Your immune system is you.

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,890
Your biology protecting you from the billions of
microorganisms that want to consume you,

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,360
and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,200
It's so manifold that it's impossible to cover in one video,

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,310
so we'll make a series looking at different aspects of it.

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,180
Today: What happens when your body is invaded

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,550
and your first lines of defenses
are engaged in a fight for life and death.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,060
It's been a normal day,

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,512
when suddenly the world explodes
and an asteroid rips the sky open.

18
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,140
Countless alien life forms invade,

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,410
ready to destroy cities and infrastructure, and eat civilians...

20
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,290
Or, this is what your cells experience.

21
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,789
You look at your bleeding thumb
that you just cut on a dirty twig in the park.

22
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,382
How annoying!

23
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:39,546
But inside the wound, a horrible catastrophe has happened.

24
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,804
There are dead cells, and blood and dirt everywhere.

25
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:48,230
Even worse, countless bacteria invade
the warm caverns between your helpless cells

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,187
to explore their new home,
steal your resources, and poop everywhere.

27
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:56,920
Immediately, the first stage of your defense kicks in.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,660
The cells that survive the impact,
or are hurt or dying, scream in panic

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,310
releasing an onslaught of chemical alarm signals
that awaken your immune system.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,212
The first cells to show up are macrophages.

31
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:17,490
If an average cell were the size of a human,
a macrophage would be the size of a black rhino.

32
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,830
A stoic cell in principle but you wouldn't want to annoy it.

33
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,870
Bacteria -do- annoy them.

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,507
Within seconds, the large cells attack
and begin killing them without mercy.

35
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:33,360
They stretch out parts like the arms of an octopus,

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,740
and grab the bacteria to
swallow them whole and digest them alive.

37
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,277
A macrophage can eat 100 bacteria before it's exhausted.

38
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:47,706
But there are too many enemies,
so the macrophages call for reinforcements.

39
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:53,741
In your blood, hundreds of thousands of neutrophils
pick up their signals and move to the battlefield.

40
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:58,474
Neutrophils are intense suicide warriors that only live to kill.

41
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:03,840
They're so enthusiastic about killing that
they kill themselves a few days after birth,

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,030
so they don't have time to accidentally
destroy your body from the inside.

43
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,970
As soon as neutrophils arrive, they begin vomiting
deadly chemicals at bacteria, or devour them.

44
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,150
They are so careless in their attacks that
they are causing real damage to your own cells.

45
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,426
But collateral damage is not their concern now,

46
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:24,570
or ever.

47
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,620
Some neutrophils go so far
to push their suicide button and explode,

48
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:37,720
casting a wide and toxic net made from their own DNA
filled with deadly chemicals that trap and kill bacteria.

49
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,450
Sometimes, they can continue fighting after that,
even though they're sort of dead already.

50
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,820
This is how much fun they have killing!

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,604
While the battle rages, your blood vessels let fluid stream
into the battlefield like a dam opening up towards a valley.

52
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,820
You notice this as inflammation.

53
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,890
Your thumb swells up a little and gets red and warm.

54
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,390
The fluid brings a silent killer into the battle zone,
millions of complement proteins.

55
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,980
A sort of automated liquid weapon that stuns
and kills bacteria by ripping holes into them.

56
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,960
We made a whole video explaining them in detail.

57
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,600
We are reaching a crossroad now.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,040
If things go well, your first line of defense
kills the invaders quickly.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,020
But sometimes, the enemies are too strong
and would overwhelm your defenses eventually,

60
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,612
which means certain death for you, the human.

61
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:34,064
This is the hour of the dendritic cell,
your immune system's intelligence officer.

62
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:36,310
While your soldiers were bashing in heads,

63
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:42,210
it was collecting samples by ripping bacteria
into tiny parts and covering itself in it.

64
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,330
Like a soldier decorating itself in the guts of a dead enemy.

65
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,370
The cell leaves the battlefield and enters
the superhighway of your immune system

66
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,810
that connects all your tissues
with your immune headquarters.

67
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,360
Your lymph nodes.

68
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,240
The dendritic cell coming from the battlefield
is looking for a helper T cell,

69
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,598
which is a sort of all-purpose commander cell
within your immune army.

70
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,500
But not any helper T cell.

71
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,360
One that happens to have just the right weapon
for the bacteria that infected your wound.

72
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:19,070
So it goes around and rubs itself, still covered
in bacteria parts, against every helper T cell it meets.

73
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,290
Most T cells are a bit disgusted and not interested.

74
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,110
But after a few hours, something clicks.

75
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,894
A helper T cell recognizes the bacteria parts.

76
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:33,351
This cell is the weapon that's needed right now.

77
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:37,400
The dendritic cell is overjoyed
and activates the helper T cell.

78
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,624
Okay, wait.

79
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:45,730
How come your immune system has a cell that has
a weapon against the specific bacteria that infected you?

80
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,580
Well, your immune system has a perfect weapon
against every possible disease in the universe.

81
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,854
Against the Black Death, the Coronavirus,
or an infection that will emerge in 100 years on Mars.

82
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:01,720
We'll talk about this a bit more
in the next video because it's very complex.

83
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,940
So, for now, just know that you have
billions of unique helper T cells

84
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,220
that each have weapons against every possible enemy.

85
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,140
After the right T cell is activated,
your second line of defense awakes

86
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,030
and rises like a teenager
that needs to get up on a school day...

87
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,380
Very slowly.

88
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,500
Your heavy weapons are
incredibly effective but they're not fast.

89
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,939
The activated helper T cell begins
to clone itself over and over again.

90
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,148
One becomes two, two become four,
until there are thousands of them.

91
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:36,556
Now, they split into two groups.

92
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:40,368
The first group quickly moves to help out your soldiers.

93
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:43,556
At the battlefield, things are getting out of hand.

94
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:46,276
A tired macrophage is ready to give up.

95
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:51,550
After fighting for days, it just wants to go to sleep
like many of its buddies have done already.

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,850
But now the helper T cells arrive.

97
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,793
One of them comes to the tired macrophage
and whispers something using special chemical signals.

98
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:04,570
In a heartbeat, the demoralized soldier feels fresh again.

99
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,640
But there's something else.

100
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,957
A hot white anger.

101
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:12,020
The macrophage knows what it needs to do...

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,210
Kill.

103
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,860
Invigorated, it throws itself
against the enemies once again.

104
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,110
All over the battlefield, this begins to happen.

105
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,047
Meanwhile, the second group of helper T cells
was working on activating another line of defense:

106
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,690
B cells, your antibody factories.

107
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,870
Antibodies are protein super weapons that look like
tiny crabs with two pincers to grab enemies.

108
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,200
Just like the helper T cells, there are B cells in your body

109
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,140
that are able to make just the right antibodies
for every possible enemy.

110
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,745
And the helper T cell is looking for exactly these B cells.

111
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:52,624
After a day or two, the right B cell is found,
and begins to clone itself.

112
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:54,800
As soon as enough clones have been made,

113
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,815
each B cell begins pumping out
up to 2,000 antibodies per second!

114
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:03,390
About a week after you injured yourself
and bacteria invaded,

115
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,522
your second line of defense finally arrives in full force.

116
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:13,465
The tiny army begins to saturate the battlefield,
pinching and stunning desperate bacteria.

117
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:17,790
The antibodies clump them together
and make them unable to move or fight,

118
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,090
while your soldiers massacre the defenseless victims.

119
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,680
The tide is turning fast.

120
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,580
As the last enemies are cleaned up,
your soldiers realize they are no longer needed,

121
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,540
and begin to kill themselves to save resources.

122
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,199
But not all of them.

123
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:37,379
A few helper T cells remain and turn into memory cells.

124
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,860
They will guard the tissue for years,

125
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,020
making sure the same bacteria
will never again gain a foothold here.

126
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,150
Similarly, a few B cells will stay alive

127
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,750
and keep producing a low amount of antibodies,

128
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,080
making you immune against this bacteria,

129
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,300
maybe for the rest of your life.

130
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,240
One day you wake up and notice
that the wound has grown over

131
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
and left nothing but a faint red mark.

132
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,290
You were completely unaware
of the drama your cells had to deal with.

133
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,520
For you, the whole ordeal was a slight annoyance.

134
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,870
While for millions of cells,
it was a desperate fight for life and death.

135
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,260
But this is just the beginning of the epic story
that unfolds inside you every day,

136
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,980
and is told in full in

137
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,760
"Immune: A Journey into the Mysterious System
That Keeps You Alive",

138
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,630
written by Philipp Dettmer,
the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt.

139
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,390
The book is a beautifully illustrated
deep dive into the immune system,

140
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,830
the most important thing
you don't know enough about,

141
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,066
that will forever change
how you think about your body.

142
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,240
Written to be as simple and fun as possible,

143
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,160
it's been an ongoing passion project
for almost a decade

144
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,259
because the immune system is just about
the most amazing and fascinating topic there is.

145
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,620
So, go on a journey and get to know your own body.

146
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,852
From mystery organs, murder universities,
to the largest library in the universe.

147
00:09:57,852 --> 00:10:02,560
Explore how incredibly vast your immune system is
and how it actually works.

148
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,883
How it fights enemies from cancer to HIV,
or just the flu.

149
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:10,680
Learn how you can boost it
and if that's actually a good idea.

150
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,750
The book will be out in six weeks

151
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,448
and it would mean the world to us
and Philipp if you could pre-order it.

152
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:19,520
Pre-ordering is super important in the world of books,

153
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,750
and in contrast to games,
we can guarantee that it's actually finished

154
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,310
and there will be no day one patch.

155
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,130
There's a link in the description.

156
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,745
This is the end of a decade-long personal journey
and we'd love to see what you think.

157
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,210
Thank you for watching.
