1
00:00:00,138 --> 00:00:02,133
Matter, as we know it;

2
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:08,322
Atoms, stars and galaxies, planets
and trees, rocks and ourselves.

3
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:12,302
Only 5% of our universe
consists of this matter.

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:17,997
About 25% is dark matter
and 70% is dark energy.

5
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:20,616
Both are invisible.

6
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:25,014
That is quite strange because it suggests
that what we experience is

7
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:28,596
only a very small part
of reality.

8
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:29,968
But it gets worse.

9
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,784
We have no idea what dark matter
and dark energy are, or how they work.

10
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,226
We're pretty sure they exist.

11
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:45,712
So what do we know?

12
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:50,869
Dark matter is the stuff that
allows galaxies to exist.

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,293
When we calculated why
the universe is the way it is

14
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:58,145
, it quickly became clear that there simply is
n't enough normal matter.

15
00:00:58,146 --> 00:01:01,104
The gravity of visible matter
is not strong enough

16
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:03,953
to form galaxies and complex
structures.

17
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:08,764
Stars would then be scattered everywhere
and would not form galaxies.

18
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:12,897
This way we know that there is something different
in and around galaxies.

19
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:16,195
Something that does not emit
or reflect light.

20
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:18,332
Something dark...

21
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:22,048
but in addition to being able to calculate
that dark matter exists

22
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,382
, we can also see it...
well... sort of.

23
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:29,232
Places with a high concentration of dark
matter bend passing light.

24
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:33,040
So we know there's something
that acts on gravity.

25
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:39,106
We now know a lot more about what dark
matter is not than what it is.

26
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:43,738
We know that dark matter is not
clouds of ordinary matter without stars,

27
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,561
because that would emit particles
that we can detect.

28
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:48,593
Dark matter is not anti-matter,

29
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:53,566
because it emits unique gamma
rays in reaction with normal matter.

30
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:57,250
Dark matter is also not made up
of black holes,

31
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,819
very compact objects that
drastically change their environment,

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,731
while dark matter
seems to be everywhere.

33
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:07,743
We know three things for sure;

34
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,047
1. There is something beyond normal matter.

35
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,726
2. It acts on gravity.

36
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:15,683
3. There's a lot of it.

37
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:19,819
Dark matter probably
consists of a complex, exotic particle

38
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,485
that doesn't interact with light and matter
as we would expect it to,

39
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:25,695
but at the moment,
we simply don't know.

40
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:29,124
Dark energy is even stranger
and mysterious.

41
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:33,407
We cannot detect it, we
cannot measure it and we cannot taste it.

42
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:36,813
But we clearly see the effects
of dark energy.

43
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:41,200
In 1929, Edward Hubble observed
how the wavelength of light

44
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:44,928
emitted from distant galaxies shifts
toward the red part of the

45
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:48,360
electromagnetic spectrum
as it travels through space.

46
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:54,120
He found that galaxies
that are further away appear redder;

47
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,787
galaxies that are closer
do not appear redder.

48
00:02:56,788 --> 00:03:01,101
Hubble explained this by stating that
the universe is expanding.

49
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:04,662
The shift to red occurs
because the wavelength of light is

50
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:07,636
stretched as the
universe expands.

51
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:12,626
More recent discoveries show that
the expansion of the universe is accelerating.

52
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:17,093
Before that, it was as if
gravity would cause the expansion

53
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:21,367
to slow down or even collapse on its
own.

54
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:26,550
Space doesn't change as it expands;
there's just more of it.

55
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,617
New space is constantly emerging everywhere,

56
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:34,417
galaxies are dense clusters of matter
held together by gravity,

57
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:38,176
so we don't notice this expansion in
our daily lives.

58
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,172
But we see it all around us.

59
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:44,646
Where there is empty space in the universe
, more and more are created.

60
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:49,816
Dark energy is thus a kind of energy
intrinsic to empty space.

61
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:52,679
Energy stronger than
anything else we know

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,731
and it just keeps getting stronger
over time.

63
00:03:55,732 --> 00:04:01,396
Empty space has more energy than all the
other things in the universe put together.

64
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:05,730
We have multiple ideas about
what dark energy could be.

65
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:11,524
An idea: dark energy is not a 'thing',
but a property of empty space.

66
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:15,219
Empty space is not nothing,
it has its own energy.

67
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,208
It can create more space
and is quite active.

68
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,770
By expanding the universe,
more empty space is created

69
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:28,174
which causes the universe
to expand faster.

70
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:32,804
This idea is similar to Einstein's idea
in 1917,

71
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,528
the concept of
a cosmological constant,

72
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:38,453
a force that opposes
gravity.

73
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:42,668
The problem is that if we try to
calculate how much of this energy there is,

74
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,453
we get an erroneous and weird result
which only confuses us.

75
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,528
Another idea is that empty space is
actually filled

76
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:54,720
with temporary, virtual particles
that spontaneously and continuously

77
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:58,223
arise and disappear from nothing.

78
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:02,030
These particles could be dark energy
.

79
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:06,748
Or maybe dark energy is
an undiscovered type of energy field

80
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:10,977
that permeates the entire universe
yet has the opposite effect

81
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,904
on the universe
than normal energy and matter.

82
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:18,543
But if it exists, we don't
know how and where to detect it.

83
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:22,191
So there are still many questions
to be answered.

84
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:27,236
Our theories about dark matter
and energy are just that: theories.

85
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:30,126
On the one hand that is quite frustrating,

86
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:34,162
on the other hand it is the front line of
science which makes it very exciting.

87
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:37,186
We see that as much as we
think we're in control of everything,

88
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:39,805
we're still primates
with smartphones,

89
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,150
on a small, fragile island
in

90
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:45,957
space looking up and
wondering how the universe works.

91
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:52,292
There is still so much to learn
and that is great.
