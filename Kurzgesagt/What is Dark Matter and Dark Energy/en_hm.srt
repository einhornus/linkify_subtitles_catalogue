1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,002
Matter, as we know it;

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:08,134
Atoms, stars and galaxies, planets and 
trees, rocks and us.

3
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:12,482
This matter accounts for less than
5% of the known universe.

4
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:18,195
About 25% is dark matter; 
and 70% is dark energy.

5
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:20,863
Both of which are invisible.

6
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:25,496
This is kind of strange because it
suggests that everything we experience is

7
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:28,652
really only a tiny fraction of reality.

8
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,971
But it gets worse.

9
00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:34,939
We really have no clue what dark matter
and energy are, or how they work.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,059
We are pretty sure they exist though.

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:45,770
So, what do we know?

12
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:50,955
Dark matter is the stuff that makes 
it possible for galaxies to exist.

13
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:54,346
When we calculated why the universe
is structured the way it is,

14
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:58,166
it quickly became clear that there's just
not enough normal matter.

15
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:01,367
The gravity of the visible matter
is not strong enough to form

16
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:03,929
galaxies and complex structures.

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,051
The stars would more likely be scattered
all over the place and not form galaxies.

18
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:13,195
So, we know there is something else inside
and around them.

19
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:16,275
Something that doesn't
emit or reflect light.

20
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,206
Something dark...

21
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:22,585
but besides being able to calculate
the existence of dark matter,

22
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:24,710
we can see it... kind of.

23
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:29,482
Places with a high concentration of dark
matter bend light passing near by.

24
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:33,141
So we know there's something there that
interacts with gravity.

25
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:39,392
Right now, we have more ideas about
what dark energy is not, than what it is!

26
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:43,799
We know dark matter is not just clouds of
normal matter without stars,

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,585
because it would emit particles
we could detect.

28
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:48,932
Dark matter is not anti-matter,

29
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:53,514
because anti-matter produces unique gamma
rays when it reacts with normal matter.

30
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:57,216
Dark matter is also not
made up of black holes,

31
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,901
very compact objects that violently affect
their surroundings,

32
00:02:00,902 --> 00:02:04,940
while dark matter seems to be
scattered all over the place.

33
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:08,016
Basically, we only know 3 things for sure;

34
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:10,442
1. Something is out there.

35
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:13,227
2. It interacts with gravity.

36
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:15,897
3. There is a lot of it.

37
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:19,847
Dark matter is probably made up of a 
complicated exotic particle

38
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,740
that doesn't interact with 
light and matter in a way we expect,

39
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,993
but right now, we just don't know.

40
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:29,517
Dark energy is even more
strange and mysterious.

41
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:33,714
We can't detect it, we can't measure it
and we can't taste it.

42
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:36,943
But we do see its effects very clearly.

43
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:41,357
In 1929, Edward Hubble examined how 
the wavelength of light

44
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:44,864
emitted by distant galaxies, shifts
towards the red end

45
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,398
of the electromagnetic spectrum
as it travels through the space.

46
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:54,336
He found that fainter, more distant galaxies
showed a large degree of red shift;

47
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:56,981
closer galaxies, not so much.

48
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:01,266
Hubble determined that this was because
the universe itself is expanding.

49
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:04,834
The red shift occurs,
because the wavelengths of light

50
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:07,634
are stretched as the universe expands.

51
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:12,744
More recent discoveries have shown that, 
the expansion of the universe is accelerating.

52
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:16,921
Before that, it was thougth that the pull
of gravity would cause the expansion to

53
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:21,434
either slow down or even retract and 
collapse in on itself at some point.

54
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:26,920
Space doesn't change its properties
as it expands; there's just more of it.

55
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:30,080
New space is constantly
created everywhere,

56
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:34,943
galaxies are tight bound clusters of stuff
held together by gravity

57
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:38,292
so we don't experience this expansion
in our daily lives.

58
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:40,301
But we see it everywhere around us.

59
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:45,051
Wherever there is empty space in the 
universe, more is forming every second.

60
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:50,141
So, dark energy seems to be some
kind of energy intrinsic to empty space.

61
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,850
Energy that is stronger than
anything else we know

62
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:56,160
and it keeps getting stronger
as time passes by.

63
00:03:56,161 --> 00:04:02,071
Empty space has more energy than
everything else in the universe combined.

64
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:06,123
We have multiple ideas about 
what dark energy might be.

65
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:11,889
One idea is, the dark energy is not
a thing, but just a property of space.

66
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,381
Empty space is not nothing, it has its own
energy.

67
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:18,530
It can generate more space and
is quite active.

68
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:22,828
So, as the universe expands,
it could be that just more and more space

69
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:28,493
appears to fill the gaps and this leads
to a faster expanding universe.

70
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:32,771
This idea is close to an idea that 
Einstein had back in 1917,

71
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,198
of the concept of a cosmological constant,

72
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,493
a force that counteracted
the force of gravity.

73
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:42,535
The only problem is, that when we tried
to calculate the amount of this energy

74
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:47,370
the result was so wrong and weird,
that it only added to the confusion.

75
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,417
Another idea is, that empty space is
actually full of

76
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:54,427
temporary, virtual particles that 
spontaneously and continually

77
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,404
form from nothing and then dissapear into
nothing again.

78
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:01,906
The energy form those particles
could be dark energy.

79
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:06,571
Or maybe dark energy is an unknown kind of
dynamic energy fluid or field

80
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:11,121
which permeates the entire universe,
but somehow has the opposite effect

81
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:14,014
on the universe than normal
energy and matter.

82
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:18,741
But if it exists, we don't know
how and where or how we could detect it.

83
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:22,320
So there are still a lot of questions to
answer.

84
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:26,055
Our theories about dark matter and
dark energy are still just that;

85
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:27,185
theories.

86
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:32,295
On one hand, this is kind of frustrating,
on the other hand this is frontier science

87
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:34,120
making it very exciting.

88
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:37,184
It shows us that no matter how much
we feel we're on top of things,

89
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:40,377
we are still very much
apes with smartphones, on a tiny

90
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:45,786
fragile island in space looking into
the sky wondering how our universe works

91
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:51,926
There is so much left to learn,
and that is awesome.
