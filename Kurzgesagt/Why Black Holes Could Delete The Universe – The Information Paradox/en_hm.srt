1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,679
Black holes are the most powerful things in the universe, strong enough to rip whole stars into atom sized pieces

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:26,139
Well, this is scary enough. They have an even more powerful and dark property: they might delete the universe itself.

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,079
Black holes in a nutshell

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,179
A black hole appears when an extraordinary amount of matter is concentrated in a tiny space.

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,389
At their center, gravity is almost infinitely strong and whatever gets too

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,429
close is ripped into its elementary particles.

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:48,549
Not even light can escape black holes, and so we perceive them as spheres of blackness.

8
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:55,779
If you were to fall into a black hole, nothing bad would happen until well after you crossed its outer border: the event horizon.

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,899
You can imagine this as swimming in a river that ends in an enormous waterfall.

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,479
As you float along, imperceptibly, the stream gets faster and faster, even if you can't see the waterfall yet.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,179
You could swim to safety, until without even noticing it, you cross the point of no return.

12
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,519
No matter how fast you try to swim now, the stream will pull you towards certain death.

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,629
Nothing can escape a black hole waterfall once it gets too close.

14
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:30,728
This border completely separates black holes from the rest of the universe: we can't access them unless we're willing to never return.

15
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:34,179
So there's no way of telling what's really going on inside black holes,

16
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,618
but we have a few ideas about what's going on right at their very edges.

17
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:44,199
Black holes radiate their mass away, like a hot pot on a stove losing its water as steam.

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,699
This is called Hawking radiation.

19
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,699
Black holes constantly lose an extremely tiny amount of their mass,

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,739
a process that's unbelievably slow.

21
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:06,519
It will take a black hole with a mass of our sun 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion years to lose 0.0000001% of its mass.

22
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,889
This is happening constantly and unstoppably, and as it goes on it speeds up more and more.

23
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,078
In the far far future when the last star in the universe has been dead for trillions of years,

24
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:25,729
black holes will become tinier and tinier until they evaporate and disappear, leaving behind just a bit of radiation.

25
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:34,098
But this is a problem, because in the process of disappearing black holes might delete something fundamental: information.

26
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,189
2 - What is information?

27
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:44,599
Information is nothing tangible. It's typically understood as a property of the arrangement of particles. What does this mean?

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,259
Imagine a bunch of carbon atoms. Arrange them in a certain way and you get coal.

29
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,449
Arrange them in a different way, and you get a diamond.

30
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,909
The atoms are the same, what changes is the information. If we make this more complex and add in a few more atoms,

31
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,388
we get a banana.

32
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:06,139
Change the arrangement of the atoms, and we get a squirrel.

33
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,939
The basic building blocks of everything in the universe are the same,

34
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,659
and don't care if they're part of a bird or a rock or a cup of coffee.

35
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,309
Without information everything in the universe would be the same.

36
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,809
According to the theory of quantum mechanics information is indestructible.

37
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,358
It might change shape,

38
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:30,529
but it can never be lost: for example if you burn a piece of paper, you get ash.

39
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,019
That ash will never become paper again.

40
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,439
But, if you were able to carefully collect every single carbon atom in the ash, and measured the exact properties of the smoke and heat

41
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,409
radiating from the fire, you could, in theory reconstruct the paper.

42
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,818
The information of the paper is still in the universe. It's not lost,

43
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,879
it's just hard to read.

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,699
If you could somehow measure every single atom and particle and wave of radiation in the universe,

45
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,779
you could see and track every bit of information there is.

46
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,659
Hypothetically, you could see the entire history of the universe right back to the Big Bang.

47
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,319
And here black holes trip us up.

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,399
Information tells us how things are different from each other and what used to be what.

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,899
Black holes do the opposite: they take different things and make them the same. They destroy information.

50
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:30,129
This creates the information paradox, and this is a serious problem.

51
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,219
The information paradox

52
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,619
It's fundamental for all our laws of physics that information can never be lost.

53
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:44,139
Existing, not existing. Without information, everything is relative.

54
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,399
When it comes to our understanding of reality, we need absolutes.

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,259
How could we solve this paradox?

56
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,399
There are a few possibilities.

57
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,639
1) Information is lost.

58
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,399
Irretrievably and forever.

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,799
This means we have to nix all our laws of physics, throwing out a lot of stuff

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,659
that's worked very well so far and to start from scratch

61
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,939
What those new laws of physics would look like, or what that means for us, nobody knows.

62
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,689
This is a little frightening, but also kind of exciting.

63
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,059
2) Information is hidden.

64
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,779
Maybe a little part of the black hole splits off and forms a baby universe.

65
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,588
The information would be transferred into this new weird place, where we could never observe or interact with it,

66
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:27,699
but technically it would not be lost.

67
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,819
It's like having a broken hard drive with all your family photos, that you could never access.

68
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,079
Sure, it's nice that they've not been deleted, but also not very helpful.

69
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,699
Or maybe black holes don't disappear completely after the end of their life cycles,

70
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,379
but a little piece is left, an information diamond.

71
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,269
like a clown car filled with an infinite amount of information clowns.

72
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,038
But there's a third option:

73
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,939
Information is safe after all, not lost or hidden.

74
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,999
Perhaps we've just been looking at this whole thing the wrong way.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,719
We know that black holes trap information and might delete it later, but we never thought about what they do with it in the meantime.

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,579
Where do black holes store their information?

77
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,899
Cosmic housekeeping

78
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,779
Let's create a black hole with dirty laundry.

79
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,079
First, we fill up a room with laundry baskets: the more laundry you want to store, the more baskets you put in the room.

80
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:30,039
But at some point every single basket is full, and the room is completely stacked, not a single extra sock fits in.

81
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,179
The room is at maximum capacity.

82
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:40,499
But if we still squeeze the sock in with a lot of energy and violence, the room collapses in on itself and forms a black hole.

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,019
But the capacity of the room itself has not changed, fitting in more stuff or information is still impossible.

84
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,499
So what happens if we throw more laundry into it?

85
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,149
The room itself gets a little bit bigger to make space for the new information.

86
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,959
It turns out a black hole grows its surface by a tiny pixel for each bit of information we throw into it.

87
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,159
In a nutshell, more information means more surface area.

88
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,649
The information gets painted on the surface, similar to what happens when we throw a stone into a pond.

89
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,788
After the stone sinks to the bottom we can't see it anymore,

90
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:19,509
but we can tell that something went in from the ripples on the surface of the pond.

91
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:26,199
Even the smallest black hole can store more information on its surface than all the data ever produced in human history.

92
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,999
They do this by storing information in a type of pixel that is unbelievably tiny.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,639
Black holes are the ultimate hard drive.

94
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,679
This is a bit like taking a paper back, and turning it into an e-book, two things that look completely different.

95
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,259
But their content is the same -- it's just encoded and memorized in another way.

96
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:53,799
Black holes swallowing stars and planets is a bit like transferring a whole library onto an e-reader.

97
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:03,639
This solution is called the holographic principle, but if it's correct then everything we thought we knew about the universe is wrong.

98
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,179
The universe is a hologram

99
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,659
If information is actually stored on the boundary of a black hole, the Hawking radiation has a chance of learning about the information

100
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,719
encoded there, and can carry it away.

101
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,918
So, information is not lost when black holes fade away,

102
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:26,259
and we do not need to redo physics: the information paradox is resolved.

103
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,179
But we still have to change our understanding of reality in a fundamental way.

104
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:39,019
If everything that falls into the black hole is stored on its event horizon, that basically means that three-dimensional stuff is encoded on a flat surface.

105
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,939
We have a name for this: a hologram.

106
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,119
A hologram is like a 3D photo, a flat piece of plastic that encodes a three-dimensional image.

107
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,759
A black hole is like a hologram, because everything inside it is encoded on its event horizon.

108
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,299
A person inside a black hole will experience their usual three-dimensional life.

109
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,299
but for us on the outside they are flattened images on the surface of the black hole.

110
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,699
The consequence of this is counterintuitive, but stay with us for a moment.

111
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,119
Black holes are very extreme objects, but they're still bound to the same rules as everything else.

112
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:21,159
So if this crazy duality between 2D and 3D works for black holes, then it might work for the whole universe, and you in it.

113
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,639
Since a person inside a black hole would not realize that they're encoded on a flat surface,

114
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,629
we might share the same fate: you really might be stretched over a flat screen at the end of the universe.

115
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:40,909
The science behind this is complicated and really weird, with toy universes to play with, string theory and a lot of maths.

116
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,959
We'll talk about this more in another video.

117
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,459
Regardless of what the true nature of the universe really is, we just know that it's strange and complicated,

118
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,369
and we have to do a lot more physics to understand it.

119
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:58,939
But black holes might be key to understanding the nature of reality itself.

120
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:05,200
This video was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, and realized with the scientific advice of Alessandro Sfondrini.
