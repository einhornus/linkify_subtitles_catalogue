1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,959
By the end of the 21st century, 
humanity is becoming desperate.  

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,279
Decades of heatwaves and droughts 
have led to unusually poor harvests,  

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,359
while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each 
year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from   

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,479
famine and resource wars have made millions 
more flee to the north. As things quickly  

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,719
get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's 
governments decide to enact an emergency plan...

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,279
It is far from certain that a grim scenario like 
this will play out. But the failure of world  

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,759
leaders to effectively address climate 
change, makes it far from impossible.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,879
So in the near future it might become necessary 
to try something radical to slow down rapid  

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,639
climate change: Geoengineering. 
Interventions so massive in scale  

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,319
that they might undo centuries of human 
behavior. Or make everything much worse.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:05,387
What is geoengineering, is it really 
an option and what if it goes wrong?

12
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:11,439
Geoengineering methods vary from fantastic ones 
like constructing giant light sails in space  

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,199
to seeding clouds with salt or 
wilder ones like fertilizing  

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,679
the oceans with iron to speed up the 
growth of trillions of algae cells.

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,399
In this video we’ll focus on an intervention 
we could see during our lifetimes:  

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,159
Stratospheric aerosol injection. A clunky term  

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,519
that means spraying stuff very high up 
in the atmosphere to keep the sun away.

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,679
Keeping the Sun away

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,719
CO2 doesn’t heat up the planet on its own, almost 
all of the energy on earth comes from the sun in  

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,599
the form of electromagnetic radiation. About 71% 
of this energy is absorbed by the earth's surface  

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,519
and atmosphere. This absorbed energy is 
emitted again, as infrared radiation. And  

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,199
CO2 is able to trap this infrared radiation 
and keep it in the atmosphere for a while.  

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,639
You can compare this effect with 
snuggling under a blanket in the morning.  

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,319
Even in a really cold room, your 
body emits infrared radiation  

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,999
and the air between your body and the blanket 
traps it and creates a warm and comfy feeling.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,479
So one way to cool down the planet would 
be to prevent energy from getting trapped  

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,999
under our planet blanket. Which is 
already happening naturally. About 29%  

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,079
of the solar radiation hitting earth 
is reflected back to space by bright  

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:34,159
surfaces like ice, deserts, snow or clouds. 
More reflection, less energy, less warming.

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,719
We can look at nature for inspiration:

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,759
Specifically the 1991 Mount Pinatubo 
eruption, the second largest volcanic  

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,599
eruption of the 20th century. Aside from 
massive devastation and almost 900 dead,  

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,279
scientists noted its strong impact on the 
global climate. The explosion ejected millions  

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,799
of tons of particles and gas as high as the 
stratosphere which hung around there for a while.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,559
The stuff that is interesting for geoengineering 
is sulphur dioxide. A nasty smelling and invisible  

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,799
gas. High in the atmosphere, it produced a haze 
of sulfuric acid droplets, that mixed with water  

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,479
and created giant veils. These veils reduced the 
sunlight reaching earth’s surface by roughly 1%.  

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,007
Global average temperatures dropped by 0.5°C.  

39
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,879
It took three years until this 
cooling effect had stopped.

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,959
Humans could imitate this process by injecting 
sulfur particles directly into the stratosphere.  

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,639
According to some scientists, this 
might be surprisingly easy to do  

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,199
and we don’t even need a lot of new 
technology for it. According to one study,  

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,399
it also might be pretty cheap compared 
with the cost of rapid climate change.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,519
A small fleet of specialized airplanes could 
ascend once a year and distribute aerosols along  

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,799
the equator from where they would be spread around 
the world. Projections assume that injecting  

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,159
between five and eight megatons of material per 
year would reflect enough sunlight to slow down  

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,039
or even stop global warming. . Giving us precious 
time to transition away from fossil fuels.

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,279
Unfortunately, there might be 
a few unhappy side effects.

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,958
There are a number of potential 
issues with aerosol injections:  

50
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,719
rainfall patterns could change which 
could negatively affect agriculture  

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,439
and cause famine. Billions of people 
could be affected in the worst case.

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,159
Also, after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, the 
acid/water veils not only cooled down the surface,  

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,599
they also heated up the 
stratosphere. As it turns out,  

54
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,879
acid is bad for the ozone layer and the 
ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest  

55
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,199
it ever has been . Injecting sulfur particles 
over decades could have a similar effect.

56
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,399
Scientists have already suggested 
using a combination of different  

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,839
minerals that might have much less 
harmful effects on the ozone layer  

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,239
but more research and experiments need 
to be done to make sure this could work.

59
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,479
But even if we don’t damage the 
ozone layer, there are other risks.

60
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,679
Politicians and industry 
might use the cooling effect  

61
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,519
as an excuse to delay the switch 
to a carbon neutral economy.

62
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,039
Even if geoengineering slows down global 
warming, humanity is still adding extra CO2  

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,639
to the atmosphere. More CO2 in the air means 
that the oceans absorb more CO2, which makes  

64
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,719
them more acidic. This is already beginning to 
be deadly to huge ecosystems like coral reefs.  

65
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,559
And the longer this continues, the 
more severe the effects will be.

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,599
But it gets worse: Once we start pumping 
particles into the atmosphere on a massive scale,  

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,959
we might be forced to do so for a long 
time, or we could risk a termination shock.

68
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,439
What that means is that if humanity 
continues to enrich the atmosphere with CO2,  

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,359
but at the same time prevents the planet 
from heating up by blocking solar radiation,  

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,519
we are sitting on a time bomb.

71
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,279
Once we stop geoengineering, the 
natural cycle will take over again,  

72
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,839
and earth would heat up. But after a few 
decades of keeping the planet artificially  

73
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,359
cold while still releasing massive amounts of 
CO2, it would heat up, much, much quicker. An  

74
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,479
increase in temperature that would take 50 
years today, could happen in just 10 years.

75
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,919
Such a temperature shock in such 
a short time would disrupt every  

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,959
major system on earth so much that it 
would be impossible to adapt in time.  

77
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,999
The worst case scenario could be dramatic 
famines and the rapid destruction of ecosystems.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,879
Humanity might survive. But the survivors would inhabit an unfamiliar and hostile world. 

79
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,919
The best case scenario is that once the world has 
finally fully understood the existential danger  

80
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,799
of rapid climate change,geoengineering 
can buy us a crucial decade or two.  

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,119
Time to transition our economies 
and maybe even pull CO2 out of the  

82
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,567
atmosphere. Maybe with technologies 
that we’ll discuss in a future video.

83
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:51,919
# Conclusion

84
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,599
Geoengineering is a scary concept. It is not a 
solution to climate change and it might even be  

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,719
a welcome excuse for the fossil fuel industry 
to delay the end of the fossil fuel age.

86
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,599
Over the last few decades geoengineering has 
been so controversial that it stopped many  

87
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,599
scientists from doing the experiments 
necessary to understand it better.  

88
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,519
But blankly opposing 
geoengineering is short sighted.

89
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,999
The sad truth is that we are already 
running a geoengineering experiment.  

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,239
We are testing how fast the world changes if 
we add about 40 billion tons of CO2 each year.  

91
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,919
This experiment is about to get really exciting.

92
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,039
Hopefully we never have to use Geoengineering. 
But if we need to in the future,  

93
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,919
we better have done the science. We better 
be prepared. Or a panicking humanity  

94
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,919
might accidentally press the self destruct button.

95
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,559
You probably won’t have to do any of that 
yourself – but who knows! Better brush up  

96
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,159
on your science knowledge, just in case. Our 
friends from Brilliant can help you with that.

97
