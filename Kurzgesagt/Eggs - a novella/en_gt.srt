1
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:06,104
You were on your way home when you passed away.

2
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:08,919
It was a car accident.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,499
Nothing particularly notable,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,759
however, fatal.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,459
It was a painless death.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,194
The paramedics did what they could to save you,

7
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,904
but to no avail.

8
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:22,614
Your body was so broken,

9
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:25,334
that in the end it was for the best, believe me.

10
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:28,214
And that's how you met me.

11
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:30,204
- What happened?

12
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:31,734
Where I am?

13
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:35,254
- You died - I exclaimed.

14
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:37,959
- No need to smooth it out.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,559
- There was... there was a truck,

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,139
and it was skidding.

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,584
- Yes

18
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:47,399
- Did I die?

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,239
- Yes

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,439
- But don't feel bad about it,

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,779
everyone dies.

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,919
You looked around you,

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,099
there was only "nothing".

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,634
Just you and me.

25
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:02,254
- What is this place?

26
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:04,634
Is this the afterlife?

27
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:06,894
- More or less

28
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:09,294
- Are you God?

29
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:12,394
- Yes, I am God

30
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:15,944
- My children! My wife!

31
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:18,334
- What about them?

32
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:21,019
- They'll be fine?

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,659
- That's what I wanted to see - I exclaimed - You just died,

34
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,319
and your biggest concern is your family.

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,259
That's wonderful.

36
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,659
You looked at me with fascination,

37
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,659
for you I did not see myself as "God".

38
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,759
I just see myself as

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,199
any man or possibly woman.

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,799
An authority figure, perhaps.

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,659
- Don't worry - I clarified - They'll be fine.

42
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,279
Your children will remember you flawlessly.

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,039
They didn't have time to cultivate

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,854
resentment towards you.

45
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:56,879
Your wife will cry on the outside

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,859
but will be secretly relieved.

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,339
To be fair, your marriage was falling apart.

48
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,339
If it's any consolation,

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,594
Ella will feel guilty for her relief.

50
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:12,799
- Oh, and what will happen now?

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,539
Will I go to heaven?

52
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,859
Or to hell or something?

53
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,699
- None.  You will reincarnate

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,599
- Oh

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,199
, so the Hindus were right?

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,639
- All religions have some reason.

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,054
Walk with me.

58
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:35,384
You followed me as we walked in the void.

59
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:37,274
- Where we go?

60
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:40,374
- Nowhere in particular.  It's nice to walk

61
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,004
while we chat.

62
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:44,934
- What's the point then?

63
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,974
When I reincarnate I'll be a blank slate,

64
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,594
right?

65
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,114
A baby.

66
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:54,544
So, all my experiences and so on,

67
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:57,434
everything I've done in this life, it doesn't matter.

68
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:58,814
- Not quite.

69
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,654
You have within you all the knowledge

70
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:04,859
and experiences of your past lives.

71
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,099
You just don't remember them right now.

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,244
I stopped

73
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:11,339
and hugged you.

74
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,979
- Your soul is even more wonderful,

75
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,219
beautiful and majestic than you can imagine.

76
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,799
The human mind can only contain a tiny fraction

77
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,459
of who you really are.

78
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,999
It is like putting your finger in a glass of water,

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,359
to see if it is hot or cold.

80
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,239
You put a small part of yourself in the container,

81
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,339
and when you take it out you have

82
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,659
gained all the experience it offers.

83
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,639
You were inside a human for the last 48 years,

84
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,899
so you haven't yet stretched out

85
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,279
and fallen into the rest of your vast consciousness.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,814
If we stay here long enough, you'll

87
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,659
start to remember everything.

88
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,959
But there's no reason to do that between lives.

89
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,579
- How many times have I reincarnated?

90
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,359
- Many times... many times.

91
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,739
and in different types.

92
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,839
This time you will be a Chinese peasant in 540 AD.

93
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,119
- Wait, what did you say?  Will you send me to the past?

94
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,419
- Technically yes.

95
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,259
Time as you know it only exists in your universe.

96
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,519
Things are different where I come from.

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,359
- "From... where do you come from?"

98
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,999
- Oh, of course, I come from somewhere, another place.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,379
And there are others like me there.

100
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,959
I know you'd like to know what that place is like,

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,359
but honestly, you wouldn't understand.

102
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,019
- Oh - you exclaimed, somewhat disappointed

103
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,139
- But wait, if I reincarnate in another place and time.

104
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,759
I may have found myself at some point.

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,259
- That's right, it happens all the time

106
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,439
And since each life only experiences itself,

107
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,319
you'll never notice.

108
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,299
- So what's the point of existing?

109
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,239
I look into your eyes

110
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,979
- The meaning of life,

111
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,719
the reason for creating this whole universe,

112
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,619
is for you to mature.

113
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,959
- You mean humanity?  Do you want us to grow up?

114
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,819
- Not only you.

115
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,239
I made this whole universe for you.

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,799
Every time you reincarnate you grow and mature,

117
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,919
becoming a bigger and better intellect.

118
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,739
- Just me?

119
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,979
What about the others?

120
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,699
- There is no one else.

121
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,879
In this universe it's just you and me.

122
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,239
You look at me stunned.

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,719
- But what about the rest of the people on earth?

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,159
- They're all you.  Different reincarnations of you.

125
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,199
- Wait, am I everyone?

126
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,619
- Do you understand now.

127
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,259
Am I all the humans who have ever lived...

128
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,199
...and will ever live?

129
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,599
- That's how it is.

130
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,899
- Am I Abraham Lincoln?

131
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,419
- And you're John Wilkes Booth, too.

132
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,279
- I'm Hitler!

133
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,519
You exclaimed in astonishment.

134
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,119
- And you're the millions he killed.

135
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,099
- I'm Jesus!

136
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,859
- And you are each one of his followers.

137
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,179
You kept silent.

138
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,259
Every time you attacked someone,

139
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,499
you attacked yourself.

140
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,879
Every act of compassion,

141
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,859
you did to yourself.

142
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,579
Every happy or sad moment lived by any human,

143
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,859
you will experience it.

144
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,819
You brooded for a long time.

145
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,399
Why?  Why did you do all this?

146
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,679
Because one day you will become me.

147
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,839
Because that is what you are.

148
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,759
You are one of mine.  You are my son.

149
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,739
- Wow!  - you exclaimed incredulously.

150
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,739
- Do you mean I'm a god?

151
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,519
- No not yet.

152
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,779
You are just a fetus,

153
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,139
you keep growing.

154
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,079
Once you have lived each life through time,

155
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,739
you will have grown enough to be born.

156
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,199
- So the whole universe, it

157
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,219
's just...

158
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,519
... an egg.

159
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,139
- I answered.  -

160
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,339
- It's time for you to move on to your next life.

161
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:32,579
And I sent you on your way.
