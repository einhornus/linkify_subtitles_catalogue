1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,099
Imagine someone coming into your kitchen and
taking a few tools, a pan and your garbage.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,885
Then they bury everything in the woods. 12,000
years later an archeologist is trying to figure who you were.

3
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:17,167
What was important to you,
what video games you played, what you believed in

4
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:24,412
and what informed your decisions. Because you happened to live during a remarkable time in human history:

5
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:31,165
The Planetary Revolution, when humanity transitioned,
becoming a multiplanetary species. 

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:41,073
In that  time, our numbers would explode by orders of magnitude, our technology and standard of living would improve to levels previously thought impossible

7
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:51,029
and our self conception would change forever. And all the future archaeologist has to learn about is your junk in the woods.

8
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,685
While we can only hope this will be someone's
problem in 12,000 years, we have the same problem today.

9
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:02,678
We are trying to reconstruct
a revolution that took place 12,000 years ago.

10
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:10,441
Today, only shadows remain of the people
who experienced our distant past as their present.

11
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:14,889
What Remains from our past

12
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,859
We can look at our present in crispy 4K, in
color and sound.

13
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,597
Three generations ago the world was just black and white.

14
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:27,982
One more generation
and we see the world through blurred photographs.

15
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:33,847
Further back paintings and texts become our
main way of experiencing the past. 

16
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:39,598
A mere 20 generations before us today, every written
word had to be copied by hand 

17
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,042
and reports became more scarce and less reliable. 

18
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:47,637
The first historian lived a mere 100 generations ago. 

19
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:54,299
Before him, there are only epics and
legends and dead kings bragging on pieces of stone. 

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:02,930
250 generations ago there are only fragments left in the ground and images stripped of their original meaning.

21
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:06,935
Eventually humanity
becomes basically invisible. 

22
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:10,564
Still, we do know some things about our ancestors. 

23
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:15,759
Let's try to tell their story and what it means for us today.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,738
#1 The Greatest Transition in Human History

25
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:26,098
For some two million years or roughly 80,000
generations, the life of our ancestors was basically the same. 

26
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:33,121
It was around 20,000 years,
or 800 generations ago that the behaviorally modern humans began a process

27
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:36,143
that would change our lifestyle forever.

28
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:44,273
At first, gradually, for some of us. Then faster for more of us.
And then suddenly for almost all of us.

29
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:48,723
Back then there were about one million modern
humans on earth. 

30
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:53,265
Most other human species had died out, probably with a little help
from us. 

31
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:56,999
Our ancestors' biology had given them the necessary tools: , 

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,527
A general intelligence
to understand things a social intelligence to understand each other 

33
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,311
and language to express
abstract ideas and create new concepts.

34
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:15,580
These were people just like you. They suffered
and experienced joy, were bored, cried and laughed.

35
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:18,627
 They lived in communities of a few
dozen people.

36
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:23,922
They controlled fire and had tools made from wood, stone and bone,

37
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:27,889
told
stories, mourned their dead and created art.

38
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,866
They traded with other tribes, from obsidian
to shellfish. 

39
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:38,641
Some hunted big game and were very mobile, others relied more on plants
they collected 

40
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:43,256
and others mostly stayed in one area with an abundance of seafood.

41
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:47,338
This was the common state of humanity for
most of our history. 

42
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:53,818
Until a slow transition, step by step, turned into a revolution.

43
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,969
#2 Step by Step

44
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,142
The first solid evidence for this stems from the Jordan Valley, 

45
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:05,530
where our ancestors collected wild wheat more than 20,000 years ago. 

46
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:09,583
They noticed that seeds in the ground made more plants the next year. 

47
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:14,353
If they put good ones in one place, the next year they had more of the good ones.

48
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,879
This was a great supplement to hunting and gathering. 

49
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,188
You could prepare some crops, return next year, build a temporary settlement and have a secure food supply.

50
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:30,282
 Our ancestors used these bonus crops to bake the first bread and to brew the first beer.

51
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:35,210
With every generation, they gathered deeper knowledge about the plants
and animals around them 

52
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:38,439
and how to manipulate them to their advantage.

53
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,009
But there was a lot to learn.

54
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,859
Very slowly, from generation to generation pockets of knowledge expanded 

55
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,696
and were passed along to be expanded again. 

56
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:54,379
This early agriculture
started to drastically reduce the space our ancestors needed to feed one individual. 

57
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,529
Which
made it possible to stay in one place longer. 

58
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:03,329
Around 12,000 years ago these little pieces
of progress had reached a critical mass.

59
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,149
Most of the calories we consume today stem from
about 15 different founder crops 

60
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,587
that humans began to domesticate in earnest in the next
few thousand years. 

61
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:17,712
What we call the agricultural revolution was not a thing that began suddenly
one day. 

62
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:22,653
It was a slow process driven by small groups over many generations. 

63
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:28,567
Eventually gradual
change gave rise to a new era.

64
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:31,352
#3 The Human Era.

65
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:36,691
During the next few thousand years, progress would speed up and turn hunter gatherers into farmers

66
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:40,269
who lived in villages, towns and then
cities. 

67
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:46,582
When farmers moved into new areas they replaced the nomadic tribes or turned them into farmers too.

68
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,467
This was neither easy nor painless. 

69
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:55,981
In the early days people had a diverse diet made of up to 250 different plants and animals.

70
00:05:55,982 --> 00:06:01,998
For some of the groups transitioning to agriculture the variation in their diets declined drastically

71
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,328
and some even seem to have been undernourished.

72
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:10,911
And living close together and with animals
created a breeding ground for disease.

73
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:18,615
Virtually every infectious disease caused by microorganisms
that have adapted to humans arose in the last 10,000 years.

74
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:23,854
Cholera, smallpox, measles,
influenza, chickenpox and malaria.

75
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:28,210
Mortality, especially among children, rose drastically.

76
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:34,387
Still, our numbers grew because living in the same place enabled women to bear far more children than before â€“

77
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:38,813
and for a farmer more kids mean more hands to work the fields.

78
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:46,356
Even with more people dying younger, villages and towns grew. The number of humans on earth exploded. 

79
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:53,065
About 100 generations after the beginning of the Human era, there were already four million of us.

80
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:59,459
This increased the need for food and forced people to come up with ever more efficient ways of producing calories -  

81
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,808
solidifying
our new lifestyle. 

82
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:07,999
Going back to hunting and gathering would just have meant death by starvation for most.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,227
One question remains unanswered: Why? 

84
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:20,424
Why would people exchange the freedom of living off nature with a huge variety in food for the grind of agriculture and often more limited diets?

85
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:25,629
Nobody knows for sure. Climate change seems to have made the transition possible

86
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,600
and some scientists argue that it was caused by external factors like undernourishment or overpopulation, 

87
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:34,219
both highly contested.

88
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:42,230
Today the most widely accepted idea is that it was a deliberate choice, made by countless communities around the globe.

89
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:45,569
Maybe it is also connected with what makes us human. 

90
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:51,822
The ability to come together, develop shared identities and exchange stories and knowledge. 

91
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:59,109
Some archaeologists think that groups of hunter gatherers traveled long and far to celebrate, to hold feasts and rituals.

92
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,807
They would have used these occasions to talk about their version of innovation:

93
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:10,679
better hunting and tool making techniques, how to catch and breed animals and which plants could be collected and multiplied,

94
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,814
maybe they even exchanged seeds.

95
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:18,569
 It is not unlikely that these gatherings were the catalysts that spread
the knowledge of agriculture 

96
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,323
through the many isolated groups of humanity. 

97
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:26,537
Ultimately ending a lifestyle that was common to our species for thousands of generations. 

98
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:31,738
So by being able to come together, celebrate, share and learn from one another, 

99
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:38,570
these humans might have taken the steps that lead to our modern world and we have much to be grateful for.

100
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:43,923
We are still the same humans today, even if
it often doesnâ€™t feel that way.

101
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:49,749
Maybe it is time to come together to share what we know and celebrate our existence once again,

102
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:56,522
to begin another peaceful transition, maybe the planetary revolution, that will change everything once more.

103
00:08:56,523 --> 00:09:04,269
So hopefully, in another
12,000 years, our descendants will look back on us today with gratitude,

104
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,283
for the amazing world they are able to inhabit.

105
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:15,686
To celebrate the achievements of our ancestors in the last 12,000 years and to look with hope towards the next 12,000

106
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:20,897
we present you with the fifth Human Era Calendar for the year 12,021 -

107
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:28,206
 this time it is all about the journey
of humanity, beginning tens of thousands of years ago, 

108
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:35,062
leading into the revolution in agriculture, to ancient high civilizations and the beginning of modern times,

109
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:37,738
culminating in a vision for our future.

110
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:43,034
You can get the limited Edition now until we sell out and then never again.

111
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:48,900
As always the calendar features 12 illustrated pages printed on high quality paper in Europe and the US.

112
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:52,157
And this year the cover is especially shiny. 

113
00:09:52,158 --> 00:10:00,689
Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream about a glorious future and realize how far we have come as a species.

114
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:09,911
It is also the best way to support kurzgesagt. The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for free, for everyone.

115
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:16,375
If you want, you can get the calendar with a Hoodie or infographic posters or plushie. We've made a few deals for you.

116
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:25,194
Thank you so much to the thousands of people who get the calendar every year and to the birbs who love what we try to do on this channel.

117
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:33,057
We wish you a happy year 12,021 â€“ And letâ€™s all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020!
