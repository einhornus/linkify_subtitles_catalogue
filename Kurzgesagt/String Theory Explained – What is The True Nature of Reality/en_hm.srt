1
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:04,599
What is the true nature of the universe?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,999
To answer this question,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,699
humans come up with stories to describe the world.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,499
We test our stories and learn what to keep and what to throw away.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,799
But the more we learn,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,629
the more complicated and weird our stories become.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,699
Some of them so much so,

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,199
that it's really hard to know what they're actually about.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,799
Like string theory.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,499
A famous, controversial and often misunderstood story,

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,699
about the nature of everything.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,599
Why did we come up with it and is it correct?

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:47,699
Or just an idea we should chuck out?

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,799
To understand the true nature of reality,

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,959
we looked at things up close and were amazed.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,999
Wonderous landscapes in the dust,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,099
zoos of bizarre creatures,

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,299
complex protein robots.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,599
All of them made from structures of molecules

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,199
made up of countless even smaller things:

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,599
Atoms.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,399
We thought they were the final layer of reality,

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,699
until we smashed them together really hard

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,019
and discovered things that can't be divided anymore:

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,899
Elementary particles.

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,799
But now, we had a problem:

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,299
They are so small that we could no longer look at them.

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,199
Think about it: what is seeing?

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,899
To see something, we need light, an electromagnetic wave.

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,999
This wave hits the surface of the thing

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,999
and gets reflected back from it into your eye.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,499
The wave carries information from the object

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,499
that your brain uses to create an image.

34
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,399
So you can't see something without somehow interacting with it.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,299
Seeing is touching, an active process, not a passive one.

36
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,839
This is not a problem with most things.

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,999
But particles are

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,499
But particles are very,

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,999
But particles are very, very,

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,359
But particles are very, very, very small.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,699
So small that the electromagnetic waves we used to see

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,599
are too big to touch them.

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,599
Visible light just passes over them.

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,899
We can try to solve this by creating electromagnetic waves

45
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,399
with more and much smaller wavelengths.

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,299
But more wavelengths, means more energy.

47
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,399
So, when we touch a particle with a wave that has a lot of energy

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,999
it alters it.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,899
By looking at a particle, we change it.

50
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,499
So, we can't measure elementary particles precisely.

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,979
This fact is so important that it has a name:

52
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,399
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,899
The basis of all quantum physics.

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,499
So, what does a particle look like then?

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,799
What is its nature?

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,899
We don't know.

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,299
If we look really hard,

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,599
we can see a blurry sphere of influence,

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,799
but not the particles themselves.

60
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,699
We just know they exist.

61
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,999
But if that's the case,

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,599
how can we do any science with them?

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,699
We did what humans do and invented a new story:

64
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,299
A mathematical fiction.

65
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,999
The story of the point particle.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,099
We decided that we would pretend that a particle is a point in space.

67
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,499
Any electron is a point with a certain electric charge and a certain mass.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,899
All indistinguishable from each other.

69
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,199
This way physicists could define them

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,999
and calculate all of their interactions.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,199
This is called Quantum Field Theory, and solved a lot of problems.

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,399
All of the standard model of particle physics is built on it

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,499
and it predicts lots of things very well.

74
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,999
Some quantum properties of the electron for example

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,299
have been tested and are accurate up to

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,799
0,

77
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,499
0,00

78
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,199
0,0000

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,899
0,000000

80
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,599
0,00000000

81
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,299
0,0000000000

82
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,999
0,000000000000

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,799
0,0000000000002 %.

84
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,399
So, while particles are not really points,

85
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,299
by treating them as if they were,

86
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,199
we get a pretty good picture of the universe.

87
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,599
Not only did this idea advance science,

88
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,299
it also led to a lot of real-world technology we use everyday.

89
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,999
But there's a huge problem:

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,399
Gravity.

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,799
In quantum mechanics, all physical forces are carried by certain particles.

92
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,499
But according to Einstein's general relativity,

93
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,199
gravity is not a force like the others in the universe.

94
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,899
If the universe is a play,

95
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,599
particles are the actors,

96
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,199
but gravity is the stage.

97
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,599
To put it simply, gravity is a theory of geometry.

98
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,898
The geometry of space-time itself.

99
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,299
Of distances, which we need to describe with absolute precision.

100
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,999
But since there is no way to precisely measure things in the quantum world,

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,399
our story of gravity doesn't work with our story of quantum physics.

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,199
When physicists tried to add gravity to the story by inventing a new particle,

103
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,299
their mathematics broke down

104
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,299
and this is a big problem.

105
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,899
If we could marry gravity to quantum physics and the standard model,

106
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,699
we would have the theory of everything.

107
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,699
So, very smart people came up with a new story.

108
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,009
They asked: What is more complex than a point?

109
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,999
A line-

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,499
A line or a string.

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,999
String theory was born.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,899
What makes string theory so elegant,

113
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,799
is that it describes many different elementary particles

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,699
as different modes of vibration of the string.

115
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,999
Just like a violin string vibrating differently can give you a lot of different notes,

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,799
a string can give you different particles

117
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,999
Most importantly, this includes gravity.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,399
String theory promised to unify all fundamental forces of the universe.

119
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,099
This caused enormous excitement and hype.

120
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,499
String theory quickly graduated to a possible theory of everything

121
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,099
Unfortunately, string theory comes

122
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,399
with a lot of strings attached.

123
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,599
Much of the maths involving a consistent string theory

124
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,299
does not work in our universe with its three spatial and one temporal dimensions.

125
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,799
String theory requires ten dimensions to work out.

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,799
So, string theorists did calculations in model universes.

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,899
And then try to get rid of the six additional dimensions and describe our own universe

128
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,099
But so far, nobody has succeeded

129
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,299
and no prediction of string theory has been proven in an experiment

130
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,199
So, string theory did not reveal the nature of our universe.

131
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,099
One could argue that in this case

132
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,009
string theory really isn't useful at all.

133
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,299
Science is all about experiments and predictions.

134
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,899
If we can't do those,

135
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,199
why should we bother with strings?

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,879
It really is all about how we use it.

137
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,799
Physics is based on maths.

138
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,899
Two plus two makes four.

139
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,899
This is true no matter how you feel about it.

140
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,999
And the maths in string theory does work out.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,159
That's why string theory is still useful.

142
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,299
Imagine that you want to build a cruise ship,

143
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,299
but you only have blueprints for a small rowing boat.

144
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,999
There are plenty of differences:

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,899
the engine,

146
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,899
the engine, the materials,

147
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,399
the engine, the materials, the scale.

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,999
But both things are fundamentally the same:

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,999
Things that float.

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,199
So, by studying the rowing boat blueprints,

151
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,399
you might still learn something about how to build a cruise ship eventually.

152
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,499
With string theory,

153
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,399
we can try to answer some questions about quantum gravity

154
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,799
that have been puzzling physicists for decades.

155
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,399
Such as how black holes work

156
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,399
or the information paradox.

157
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,399
String theory may point us in the right direction.

158
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,799
When used in this spirit,

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,499
string theory becomes a precious tool for theoretical physicists

160
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,399
and help them discover new aspects of the quantum world

161
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,799
and some beautiful mathematics.

162
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,999
So, maybe the story of string theory

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,199
is not the theory of everything.

164
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,599
But just like the story of the point particle,

165
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,499
it may be an extremely useful story.

166
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,399
We don't yet know what the true nature of reality is

167
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,299
but we'll keep coming up with stories to try and find out.

168
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,599
Until one day,

169
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,599
Until one day, hopefully

170
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,229
Until one day, hopefully, we do know.
