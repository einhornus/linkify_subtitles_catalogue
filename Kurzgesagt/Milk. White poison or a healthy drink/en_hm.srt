1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,819
Over the last decade, milk has become a bit controversial.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:10,079
Some people say it's a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,679
but others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,719
So, who's right?

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,459
And why are we drinking it anyway?

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,979
[Intro music]

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,219
Milk is the basis of every mammal's diet after birth,

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,239
when our digestive systems are immature and small.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,979
Basically, it's power food to kick-start our bodies and help us grow.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,619
Milk is rich in fat, vitamins, minerals, and milk-sugar: lactose.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,379
On top of that, for a while after birth, it also contains antibodies and proteins

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,599
that protect us from infections and regulate our immune system.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,319
But it's a lot of effort for mothers to produce.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,059
Eventually, humans stop drinking mother's milk

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,899
and transition to the diet of their parents.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,999
This is how it's been for thousands of years.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,259
Until about eleven thousand years ago,

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,459
when our ancestors settled down in the first agricultural communities.

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,479
Soon, they domesticated the first dairy animals:

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,319
goats, sheep, and cattle.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,119
They found that dairy animals are able to eat useless and abundant stuff

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,439
and turn it into nutritious and tasty food.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,079
This made a huge difference in terms of survival,

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,659
especially in hard times.

25
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,119
So groups that had milk available had an evolutionary advantage.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,799
And through natural selection,

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,079
it changed the genes of communities who consumed a lot of it.

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,719
This adaptation has to do with a specialized enzyme: lactase.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,699
Babies have a lot of it in their system,

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,319
so they can break down the milk-sugar lactose and digest milk easily.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,999
But the older we grow, the fewer lactase enzymes our body produces.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,159
Worldwide, about 65% of the population do not have the enzyme after infancy,

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,239
which means they are not able to digest more than about 150 milliliters each day.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,038
This lactose intolerance is not spread evenly around the world, though.

35
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,639
In some East Asian communities, for example, it's up to 90%.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,939
In Northern Europe and North America, the rates are the lowest overall.

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,219
There are probably a few reasons for this uneven distribution.

38
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,079
The trait was first introduced by random mutation,

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,659
which happened independently of each other in a few populations.

40
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,619
The fact that farming replaced hunting and gathering more and more

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,839
created natural-selection pressure.

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,499
People who were able to digest lactose had more foods at hand,

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,139
which was an advantage.

44
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:52,179
The migration of dairy farmers to the north then spread it further, which probably pushed back populations there that didn't have the trait.

45
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:01,199
Okay, but if milk has been a valuable part of our diet for thousands of years, why is it so controversial?

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,699
There are a number of claims regarding the negative and positive health effects of milk.

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,999
The negative ones cover a wide variety,

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,208
from brittle bones to cancer, and cardiovascular diseases to intolerance and allergies.

49
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,609
So, how do they hold up?

50
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:26,409
Some older studies found a connection between milk and a high risk of breast, colon, and prostate cancer

51
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,729
But meta analyses found no impact on your cancer risk.

52
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,129
On the contrary, the calcium in milk might even have a protective effect against colon cancer.

53
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,219
Although this could be calcium in general, it's not clear milk plays a role in this effect.

54
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,849
Only studies on prostate cancer showed an increased risk for people who consumed more than one and a quarter liters of milk a day.

55
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,089
But again, the association is inconsistent and other studies don't find any effects.

56
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,439
We discuss these studies in more detail in our sources document. All in all, the research seems to show that if you drink between

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:09,299
100 to 250 milliliters of milk per day, cancer is not a concern.

58
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,879
Similarly, meta-analyses could not find any impact from milk or dairy products on

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,199
your risk of heart disease, stroke, or your total mortality.

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,419
Some studies even suggested that high blood pressure might be rarer in people who eat a lot of dairy,

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,159
although the evidence is not strong enough to claim this with confidence.

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,579
The case gets more complicated though when we look at bones.

63
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,559
A number of studies found neither positive nor negative effects for adults.

64
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,219
What most people worry most about though are harmful amounts of pesticides, antibiotics, or hormones.

65
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,179
There are hormones in milk, but only in very low concentrations.

66
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,819
For example to get the same amount of hormones as from the pill,

67
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,519
you'd need to drink about 5000 litres of milk,

68
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,599
and even if you did, most hormones would be destroyed by your digestive system

69
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,599
before they could affect you,

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,299
which is the reason why so much medication is coated to protect it from our digestion.

71
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,549
For pesticides and antibiotics,

72
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,189
there are regulations in most parts of the world that only allow completely harmless amounts.

73
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,559
Milk that surpasses these thresholds is not allowed to go on the shelf.

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,739
So there's nothing in particular to worry about.

75
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,059
Besides allergies and those suffering from lactose intolerances,

76
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:32,399
the best known negative effects of milk are probably acne and general discomfort after drinking milk or eating dairy products,

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,459
and here the effects are very real.

78
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,819
For example, skimmed milk has been found to statistically increase the rate of acne by 24%.

79
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,859
Allergies against milk products are especially prevalent among children, with one in 18 kids in Germany suffering from them.

80
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,299
In general, these allergies tend to get better or disappear as they grow older though.

81
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,979
Okay. Is milk healthy then?

82
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,579
Milk, no matter if it comes from mothers, cows, sheep, goats, or camels is a nutrient-dense food.

83
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,039
It contains all necessary macronutrients and many micronutrients.

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,019
Especially in regions where people struggle to get enough calories,

85
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,939
milk can contribute to a healthy life and lower child mortality.

86
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,419
For those living in the developed world, in general

87
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,899
milk is not harmful if you are not allergic or intolerant to it.

88
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,799
Especially for children, it's a good way to get large amounts of calcium

89
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,929
and for vegetarians, it's a good source of vitamin b12 and B vitamins in general.

90
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:39,759
This does not mean there are not other alternatives with the same effect. You do not need to drink milk to be healthy

91
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,509
Milk is also definitely not a substitute for water.

92
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:51,129
Milk is power food, and the additional calories from drinking a lot of it on a regular basis can contribute to being overweight.

93
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:59,529
Especially flavored milk or chocolate milk is more comparable to beverages like lemonade than a healthy snack, and there's another thing to consider.

94
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,879
Milk production has a significant impact on the global climate.

95
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,638
About 33 percent of cropland is used to feed grazing animals including dairy cattle

96
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,679
Even though the carbon footprint of dairy products has declined since 1990,

97
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,599
Dairy production is still responsible for 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions,

98
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,639
even more than all airplanes combined.

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:29,228
Milk is a huge industry and sadly, most of its production in factory farms causes incredible suffering.

100
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,899
Cows are impregnated over and over, separated from their young shortly after birth,

101
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,679
and slaughtered once their tortured bodies are not productive anymore.

102
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,499
We can't ignore that much of the milk we consume stems from an industry

103
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,719
that is basically torture and contributes to climate change.

104
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,879
What about plant-based milk?

105
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,619
In terms of protein levels and nutritional value, only soy milk can compare to cow milk.

106
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,339
The others need to be artificially enriched to reach similar levels of vitamins and calcium.

107
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,169
So they can be an alternative to milk.

108
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,379
And another option might be available soon.

109
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,899
Several startups have created non-animal milk

110
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,659
that is nutritionally identical to dairy milk,

111
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,319
for example, through fermentation by gene modified bacteria.

112
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,459
This lab-grown milk can even be turned into cheese,

113
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,559
something that plant based alternatives struggle with because they lack casein and whey protein,

114
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,109
the key ingredients that give dairy its taste and structure.

115
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,769
The environmental impact is a different story though.

116
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,199
Many milk alternatives use significantly less energy, land and less water to produce

117
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,699
so they have a much lower environmental impact than animal milk.

118
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:53,039
If you want to have the lowest possible negative impact on the planet, the best choice is whatever milk alternative is regional.

119
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,789
As with almost any topic milk is complicated.

120
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,429
It's not harmful for the majority of the population and it's crucial for many people around the world.

121
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,719
It's good, nutritious food, but also harmful to the planet and causes a lot of suffering.

122
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,079
We need to decide as a society how we want to deal with these facts.

123
