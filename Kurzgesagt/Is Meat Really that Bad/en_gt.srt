Food is arguably the best thing about  being alive. No other bodily pleasure is   enjoyed multiple times every day and never  gets old. It is an expression of culture,   our parents' love and a means  of celebration or comfort. That’s why it hits a special nerve when we are  told we should change what and how we eat to   fight rapid climate change. One of the most  delicious foods, meat gets the worst press.   It doesn’t help that the topic is really  hard to properly research yourself   and debates get emotional quickly. But  clearly science can give us an answer! The reality is, well, it’s complicated. Let’s take a look at three  climate arguments against   meat that are used a lot and see what happens. #   1. Does our Diet REALLY play that  big a role in climate change? Feeding billions of people is impossible without  causing emissions. Even if someday we have   zero-carbon tractors, refrigerators and cookers  running on renewable energy and electric trucks   to move our food, there are still unavoidable  emissions. Rice emits methane. We cut down forests   to make room for pastures and crops. And we emit  nitrous oxide when we use fertilizers and manure. Worldwide food production is responsible for about  26% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions.   Which is unfortunate, since food is not  optional. While 26% doesn’t sound THAT bad   it means that even if we extinguished  all other sources of emissions today,   the emissions from food alone would still  use up our entire carbon budget by 2100.   So no matter how we twist and turn it,  food is a real driver of climate change. Still, emissions from different  food items vary a lot.   How do things look when we compare  their footprints separately? Foods’ climate impact is most often  based on “life cycle assessments”:   an analysis that looks at all the emissions  of a product throughout its existence,   from production to transportation,  packaging, use and waste management. In the most detailed meta analysis of life  cycle assessments to date, beef emissions   stand out at the top. On average, a kilogram  of beef emits 71 kilograms of CO2 equivalents.   Lamb is also high, at 40 kilograms. Pork emits  12 and poultry 10 kilograms. At the bottom we   have lots of plant-based foods: Potatoes, for  example,emit around 150 times less than beef. The most important aspect of food isn’t weight  though,it’s nutrient density. A kilogram of beef   would keep you alive much longer than a kilogram  of potatoes– so how does the ranking change   if we compare emissions per calorie or protein?  Not much. Animal protein is still the most   costly for the environment and beef and lamb  are also outliers in emissions per calorie. But is this fair? After all, not all beef is the  same. There are all sorts of ways to rear cattle,   from pure grass fed to factory farming.  The worst beef comes in at 105 kilograms   of emissions per 100 grams of protein –  the best at only 9 – a tenfold difference.   In contrast, most other  foods, especially plant based,   have a much narrower spectrum. Still, the  best beef is worse than the worst plant. Ok but this seems promising – can we buy  the right beef and lower our emissions?   Maybe by buying locally produced  beef to minimize our footprint? # 2. Does Buying Local Food Actually Matter? Let us stick with beef  since it is such an outlier. By buying locally, you are trying to avoid  emissions from transportation and packaging.   But it turns out these only account for  0.5 to 2% of beef's total emissions.   Actually, transport and packaging combined  are only about 11% of all food emissions. Nearly all food transport emissions  are produced over the last few miles,   the regional travel on the road supplying  the markets and shops in your area.   International food transport happens mostly on  freight ships, which are insanely efficient. For example, shipping one kilogram of  avocados from South America to Europe   generates about 0.3 kilograms of CO2  equivalents in transport emissions   and around 2.5 kilograms overall – while one  kilogram of beef from your local butcher will   come in at 18 kg in CO2 equivalents at least .  So even when shipped great distances, emissions   from almost all plant-based foods cause lower  emissions than locally produced animal products. Ok, so if transport doesn’t play a big role,   what causes the vast amounts  of emissions from beef then? By far the largest share of beef emissions  consists of methane released directly by the   animals. While CO2 hangs around for centuries,  methane only stays in the atmosphere for decades.   But in these short periods, it is very powerful.  All in all, methane has already caused 23 to 40%   of human-made warming so far. There is controversy  about how bad this is exactly and we don’t want   to dive in too deep here – but the way things  stand, any kinds of extra emissions are not great. Still – all cows burp and fart to similar degrees  – what explains the spectrum of beef emissions? There are a couple things: It makes a difference if the beef comes from a  dairy herd or one dedicated to beef production.   44% of the world’s beef comes from dairy cows,  sharing its footprint with dairy products. Dairy   cows tend to get higher quality feed, which  makes them grow faster and emit less methane.   Geography also plays a role, because it  determines which farming methods are possible. The worst factor by far is the destruction  of forests for farmland. Not only does this   release the CO2 that was bound in the  flora, it sets free carbon that was   stored in the soil and destroys its  ability to store it in the future. This aspect accounts for much of  the range of emissions in beef:   the worst emitters are farms burning down  rainforest for farmland, especially in Brazil. There is a sinister truth hidden here: The  more animals suffer, the better they are in   terms of climate change because they are way more  efficient. They use less land and their food is   brought right to them, and so they grow faster  and don’t expend energy on things like walking.   Cattle in a factory farm that never get to roam  pastures can sometimes be less destructive for   the climate than cattle grazing peacefully  on a formally lush piece of rainforest. But isn’t it a bit out of touch with  reality to demonize cows so much?   Some of the land these animals are grazing  on isn’t suitable for crops anyway.   By grazing on pastures they  can turn things we can’t digest   into food. Isn’t farming animals just a smart  way to make the best use of unused resources? #3 Don’t Cows mainly use Land that we  can’t use for agriculture or other things? About half of the world’s ice- and desert-free  land is used for agriculture, an area the size   of the entire Americas plus China. Half of all  agriculturally used land is dedicated to animals.   Most of it is grassland, 65% of which can not be  converted to cropland, so pasturing animals is   actually a very efficient way to use those areas,  since we can’t grow human food there anyway. There are a couple of catches here though. While the idea of cows turning useless grass  into steak is nice, it is a marketing lie.   Even though it is so massive, pastureland  alone can’t support the ruminants living on it.   Globally, grazing systems sustain only 13% of  beef production. So if we were to switch to 100%   grass fed, we’d simply have to  eat much less beef – in the US   beef production would crash by some 70%  if it were to exclusively rely on grass. The only way to sustain our high demand for  meat is by growing crops and feeding them to our   cattle. And we haven’t even talked about chickens  and pigs, who exclusively eat feed crops . Because of this feed demand, less than half of the  world’s cereals are used directly as human food.   41% is fed to animals. The same is true for  soy. There is a lot of talk about Amazon   deforestation for soy production, which makes  us think of soy milk and tofu. But only 19%   of global soy production goes towards products  for humans. About 77% is used to feed animals. Besides, land without food crops isn’t  automatically ecologically useless.   A beef free diet would free up around  2 billion hectares, a vegan diet would   free up around 3 billion hectares of land. We  could use this land to grow forests or restore   wild grasslands – basically anything that could  suck carbon out of the atmosphere. If we spared   3 billion hectares of land, it could remove about  800 billion tonnes of CO2 from the air over 100   years. By comparison we emit about 50 billion  tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year at the moment. Ok to summarize. Food is a huge driver of emissions. Meat  but especially beef is the worst food in   terms of emissions. Buying locally does  not have a big impact on food emissions   compared to the type of food you are  consuming. When it comes to beef,   cattle that are grass fed can sometimes even  be counterproductive because they just need   much more land. Even if you find the most  environmentally-friendly beef in the world,   your burger still comes with a significantly  higher carbon footprint than a veggie pattie.   You can decide for yourself what you  want to do with this information. In fact, you are always only one  decision away from making a change.   You could start learning a new skill or dive into  a new interest today – it’s up to you.
