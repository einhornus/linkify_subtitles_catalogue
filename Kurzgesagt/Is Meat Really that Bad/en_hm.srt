1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,120
Food is arguably the best thing about 
being alive. No other bodily pleasure is  

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,640
enjoyed multiple times every day and never 
gets old. It is an expression of culture,  

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,240
our parents' love and a means 
of celebration or comfort.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,280
That’s why it hits a special nerve when we are 
told we should change what and how we eat to  

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,280
fight rapid climate change. One of the most 
delicious foods, meat gets the worst press.  

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,440
It doesn’t help that the topic is really 
hard to properly research yourself  

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,320
and debates get emotional quickly. But 
clearly science can give us an answer!

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,640
The reality is, well, it’s complicated.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
Let’s take a look at three 
climate arguments against  

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,840
meat that are used a lot and see what happens.

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
#  

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,240
1. Does our Diet REALLY play that 
big a role in climate change?

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,600
Feeding billions of people is impossible without 
causing emissions. Even if someday we have  

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,960
zero-carbon tractors, refrigerators and cookers 
running on renewable energy and electric trucks  

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,600
to move our food, there are still unavoidable 
emissions. Rice emits methane. We cut down forests  

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,840
to make room for pastures and crops. And we emit 
nitrous oxide when we use fertilizers and manure.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,280
Worldwide food production is responsible for about 
26% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions.  

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,720
Which is unfortunate, since food is not 
optional. While 26% doesn’t sound THAT bad  

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,400
it means that even if we extinguished 
all other sources of emissions today,  

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,080
the emissions from food alone would still 
use up our entire carbon budget by 2100.  

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,080
So no matter how we twist and turn it, 
food is a real driver of climate change.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,840
Still, emissions from different 
food items vary a lot.  

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,520
How do things look when we compare 
their footprints separately?

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,440
Foods’ climate impact is most often 
based on “life cycle assessments”:  

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,600
an analysis that looks at all the emissions 
of a product throughout its existence,  

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,920
from production to transportation, 
packaging, use and waste management.

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,840
In the most detailed meta analysis of life 
cycle assessments to date, beef emissions  

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,880
stand out at the top. On average, a kilogram 
of beef emits 71 kilograms of CO2 equivalents.  

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,960
Lamb is also high, at 40 kilograms. Pork emits 
12 and poultry 10 kilograms. At the bottom we  

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,680
have lots of plant-based foods: Potatoes, for 
example,emit around 150 times less than beef.

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,040
The most important aspect of food isn’t weight 
though,it’s nutrient density. A kilogram of beef  

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,160
would keep you alive much longer than a kilogram 
of potatoes– so how does the ranking change  

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,880
if we compare emissions per calorie or protein? 
Not much. Animal protein is still the most  

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,400
costly for the environment and beef and lamb 
are also outliers in emissions per calorie.

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,680
But is this fair? After all, not all beef is the 
same. There are all sorts of ways to rear cattle,  

36
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,440
from pure grass fed to factory farming. 
The worst beef comes in at 105 kilograms  

37
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,120
of emissions per 100 grams of protein – 
the best at only 9 – a tenfold difference.  

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
In contrast, most other 
foods, especially plant based,  

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,800
have a much narrower spectrum. Still, the 
best beef is worse than the worst plant.

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,640
Ok but this seems promising – can we buy 
the right beef and lower our emissions?  

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,840
Maybe by buying locally produced 
beef to minimize our footprint?

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,040
# 2. Does Buying Local Food Actually Matter?

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
Let us stick with beef 
since it is such an outlier.

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,480
By buying locally, you are trying to avoid 
emissions from transportation and packaging.  

45
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
But it turns out these only account for 
0.5 to 2% of beef's total emissions.  

46
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,440
Actually, transport and packaging combined 
are only about 11% of all food emissions.

47
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,320
Nearly all food transport emissions 
are produced over the last few miles,  

48
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,920
the regional travel on the road supplying 
the markets and shops in your area.  

49
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,760
International food transport happens mostly on 
freight ships, which are insanely efficient.

50
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,640
For example, shipping one kilogram of 
avocados from South America to Europe  

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,280
generates about 0.3 kilograms of CO2 
equivalents in transport emissions  

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,360
and around 2.5 kilograms overall – while one 
kilogram of beef from your local butcher will  

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,560
come in at 18 kg in CO2 equivalents at least . 
So even when shipped great distances, emissions  

54
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,680
from almost all plant-based foods cause lower 
emissions than locally produced animal products.

55
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,520
Ok, so if transport doesn’t play a big role,  

56
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,480
what causes the vast amounts 
of emissions from beef then?

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,400
By far the largest share of beef emissions 
consists of methane released directly by the  

58
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,200
animals. While CO2 hangs around for centuries, 
methane only stays in the atmosphere for decades.  

59
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:20,160
But in these short periods, it is very powerful. 
All in all, methane has already caused 23 to 40%  

60
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,160
of human-made warming so far. There is controversy 
about how bad this is exactly and we don’t want  

61
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,600
to dive in too deep here – but the way things 
stand, any kinds of extra emissions are not great.

62
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,160
Still – all cows burp and fart to similar degrees 
– what explains the spectrum of beef emissions?

63
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,400
There are a couple things:

64
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,000
It makes a difference if the beef comes from a 
dairy herd or one dedicated to beef production.  

65
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,800
44% of the world’s beef comes from dairy cows, 
sharing its footprint with dairy products. Dairy  

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,520
cows tend to get higher quality feed, which 
makes them grow faster and emit less methane.  

67
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Geography also plays a role, because it 
determines which farming methods are possible.

68
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,160
The worst factor by far is the destruction 
of forests for farmland. Not only does this  

69
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
release the CO2 that was bound in the 
flora, it sets free carbon that was  

70
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,680
stored in the soil and destroys its 
ability to store it in the future.

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,840
This aspect accounts for much of 
the range of emissions in beef:  

72
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,600
the worst emitters are farms burning down 
rainforest for farmland, especially in Brazil.

73
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,600
There is a sinister truth hidden here: The 
more animals suffer, the better they are in  

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,960
terms of climate change because they are way more 
efficient. They use less land and their food is  

75
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,240
brought right to them, and so they grow faster 
and don’t expend energy on things like walking.  

76
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,880
Cattle in a factory farm that never get to roam 
pastures can sometimes be less destructive for  

77
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,760
the climate than cattle grazing peacefully 
on a formally lush piece of rainforest.

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
But isn’t it a bit out of touch with 
reality to demonize cows so much?  

79
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,680
Some of the land these animals are grazing 
on isn’t suitable for crops anyway.  

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,240
By grazing on pastures they 
can turn things we can’t digest  

81
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,520
into food. Isn’t farming animals just a smart 
way to make the best use of unused resources?

82
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,640
#3 Don’t Cows mainly use Land that we 
can’t use for agriculture or other things?

83
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,120
About half of the world’s ice- and desert-free 
land is used for agriculture, an area the size  

84
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,440
of the entire Americas plus China. Half of all 
agriculturally used land is dedicated to animals.  

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,480
Most of it is grassland, 65% of which can not be 
converted to cropland, so pasturing animals is  

86
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,120
actually a very efficient way to use those areas, 
since we can’t grow human food there anyway.

87
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,600
There are a couple of catches here though.

88
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,240
While the idea of cows turning useless grass 
into steak is nice, it is a marketing lie.  

89
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,320
Even though it is so massive, pastureland 
alone can’t support the ruminants living on it.  

90
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,320
Globally, grazing systems sustain only 13% of 
beef production. So if we were to switch to 100%  

91
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,360
grass fed, we’d simply have to 
eat much less beef – in the US  

92
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,720
beef production would crash by some 70% 
if it were to exclusively rely on grass.

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,600
The only way to sustain our high demand for 
meat is by growing crops and feeding them to our  

94
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:33,200
cattle. And we haven’t even talked about chickens 
and pigs, who exclusively eat feed crops .

95
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,800
Because of this feed demand, less than half of the 
world’s cereals are used directly as human food.  

96
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,840
41% is fed to animals. The same is true for 
soy. There is a lot of talk about Amazon  

97
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,000
deforestation for soy production, which makes 
us think of soy milk and tofu. But only 19%  

98
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,280
of global soy production goes towards products 
for humans. About 77% is used to feed animals.

99
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,040
Besides, land without food crops isn’t 
automatically ecologically useless.  

100
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,360
A beef free diet would free up around 
2 billion hectares, a vegan diet would  

101
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,920
free up around 3 billion hectares of land. We 
could use this land to grow forests or restore  

102
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,920
wild grasslands – basically anything that could 
suck carbon out of the atmosphere. If we spared  

103
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,800
3 billion hectares of land, it could remove about 
800 billion tonnes of CO2 from the air over 100  

104
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,240
years. By comparison we emit about 50 billion 
tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year at the moment.

105
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
Ok to summarize.

106
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,640
Food is a huge driver of emissions. Meat 
but especially beef is the worst food in  

107
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,360
terms of emissions. Buying locally does 
not have a big impact on food emissions  

108
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
compared to the type of food you are 
consuming. When it comes to beef,  

109
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,920
cattle that are grass fed can sometimes even 
be counterproductive because they just need  

110
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,040
much more land. Even if you find the most 
environmentally-friendly beef in the world,  

111
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,840
your burger still comes with a significantly 
higher carbon footprint than a veggie pattie.  

112
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
You can decide for yourself what you 
want to do with this information.

113
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,560
In fact, you are always only one 
decision away from making a change.  

114
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,320
You could start learning a new skill or dive into 
a new interest today – it’s up to you. If only  

115
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,000
that first step wasn’t so hard to take. We have 
something for you to make it a little easier.

116
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,720
We are big fans of Skillshare, an online 
learning community that offers thousands
