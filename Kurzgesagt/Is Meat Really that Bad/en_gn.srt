1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,878
food is arguably the best thing about

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,119
being alive no other bodily pleasure is

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,119
enjoyed multiple times every day and

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,799
never gets old

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,879
it's an expression of culture our

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,518
parents love and a means of celebration

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,279
or comfort

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,879
that's why it hits a special nerve when

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,639
we're told we should change what and how

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,679
we eat to fight rapid climate change

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,919
one of the most delicious foods meat

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,999
gets the worst press

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,598
it doesn't help that the topic is really

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,598
hard to properly research yourself and

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,078
that debates get emotional quickly

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,919
but clearly science can give us an

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,119
answer

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,639
the reality is well it's complicated

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,999
let's take a look at three climate

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,759
arguments against meat that are used a

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,840
lot and see what happens

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,500
[Music]

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,878
one does our diet really play that

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,839
bigger role in climate change

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,999
feeding billions of people is impossible

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,078
without causing emissions

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,318
even if someday we have zero carbon

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,559
tractors refrigerators and cookers

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,559
running on renewable energy and electric

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,959
trucks to move our food there are still

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,559
unavoidable emissions

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,399
rice emits methane

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,399
we cut down forests to make room for

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,158
pastures and crops

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,399
and we emit nitrous oxide when we use

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,118
fertilizers and manure

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,359
worldwide food production is responsible

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,758
for about 26 of all human made

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,078
greenhouse gas emissions which is

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,919
unfortunate since food is not optional

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,719
while 26 percent doesn't sound that bad

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,478
it means that even if we extinguish to

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,639
all other sources of emissions today the

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,639
emissions from food alone would still

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,279
use up our entire carbon budget by 2100

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,919
so no matter how we twist and turn it

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,879
food is a real driver of climate change

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,639
still emissions from different food

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,478
items vary a lot

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,239
how do things look when we compare their

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,879
footprints separately

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,359
foods climate impact is most often based

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,239
on life cycle assessments an analysis

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,919
that looks at all the emissions of a

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,839
product throughout its existence from

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,399
production to transportation packaging

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,878
use and waste management

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,199
in the most detailed meta-analysis of

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,279
life cycle assessments to date beef

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,399
emissions stand out at the top on

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,039
average a kilogram of beef emits 71

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,679
kilograms of co2 equivalents

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,039
lamb is also high at 40 kilograms pork

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,238
emits 12 and poultry 10 kilograms

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,598
at the bottom we have lots of

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,359
plant-based foods

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,479
potatoes for example emit around 150

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,719
times less than beef

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,119
the most important aspect of food isn't

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,999
weight though it's nutrient density

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,999
a kilogram of beef would keep you alive

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,399
much longer than a kilogram of potatoes

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,479
so how does the ranking change if we

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,679
compare emissions per calorie or protein

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,039
not much

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,279
animal protein is still the most costly

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,759
for the environment and beef and lamb

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,919
are also outliers in emissions per

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,359
calorie

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,318
but is this fair after all not all beef

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,439
is the same

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,119
there are all sorts of ways to rear

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,679
cattle from pure grass-fed to factory

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,719
farming

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,439
the worst beef comes in at 105 kilograms

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,079
of emissions per 100 grams of protein

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,719
the best at only nine a tenfold

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,079
difference

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,479
in contrast most other foods especially

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,238
plant-based have a much narrower

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,598
spectrum

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,079
still the best beef is worse than the

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,679
worst plant

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,318
okay but this seems promising can we buy

95
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,279
the right beef and lower our emissions

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,679
maybe by buying locally produced beef to

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,399
minimize our footprint

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,639
two does buying local food actually

99
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,639
matter

100
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,878
let's stick with beef since it's such an

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,919
outlier

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,919
by buying locally you are trying to

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,999
avoid emissions from transportation and

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,119
packaging

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,039
but it turns out these only account for

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,518
0.5 to 2 percent of beef's total

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,639
emissions

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,318
actually transport and packaging

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,958
combined are only about 11 of all food

110
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,238
emissions

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,318
nearly all food transport emissions are

112
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,479
produced over the last few miles the

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,159
regional travel on the road supplying

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,719
the markets and shops in your area

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,638
international food transport happens

116
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,559
mostly on freight ships which are

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,399
insanely efficient

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,239
for example shipping one kilogram of

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,638
avocados from south america to europe

120
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,439
generates about 0.3 kilograms of co2

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,439
equivalents in transport emissions and

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,879
around 2.5 kilograms overall while one

123
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,119
kilogram of beef from your local butcher

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,839
will come in at 18 kilograms in co2

125
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,918
equivalents at least

126
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,159
so even when shipped great distances

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,079
emissions from almost all plant-based

128
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,399
foods cause lower emissions than locally

129
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,559
produced animal products

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,879
okay so if transport doesn't play a big

131
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,198
role what causes the vast amounts of

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,359
emissions from beef then

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,279
by far the largest share of beef

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,519
emissions consists of methane released

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,839
directly by the animals

136
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,799
while co2 hangs around for centuries

137
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,719
methane only stays in the atmosphere for

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,918
decades

139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,319
but in these short periods it is very

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,839
powerful

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,198
all in all methane has already caused 23

142
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,599
to 40 percent of human-made warming so

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,638
far

144
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,719
there's controversy about how bad this

145
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,638
is exactly and we don't want to dive in

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,038
too deep here but the way things stand

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,279
any kinds of extra emissions are not

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,638
great

149
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,198
still all cows burp and fart to similar

150
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,359
degrees what explains the spectrum of

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,038
beef emissions

152
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,038
there are a couple of things

153
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,638
it makes a difference if the beef comes

154
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,119
from a dairy herd or one dedicated to

155
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,799
beef production

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,359
44 of the world's beef comes from dairy

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,439
cows sharing its footprint with dairy

158
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,478
products

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,399
dairy cows tend to get higher quality

160
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,399
feed which makes them grow faster and

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,079
emit less methane

162
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,079
geography also plays a role because it

163
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,679
determines which farming methods are

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,879
possible

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,719
the worst factor by far is the

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,359
destruction of forests for farmland

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,279
not only does this release the co2 that

168
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,439
was bound in the flora it sets free

169
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,439
carbon that was stored in the soil and

170
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,279
destroys its ability to store it in the

171
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,799
future

172
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,559
this aspect accounts for much of the

173
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,638
range of emissions in beef

174
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,559
the worst emitters are farms burning

175
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,038
down rainforest for farmland especially

176
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,559
in brazil

177
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,198
there is a sinister truth hidden here

178
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,279
the more animals suffer the better they

179
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,038
are in terms of climate change because

180
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,959
they are way more efficient

181
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,959
they use less land and their food is

182
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,879
brought right to them and so they grow

183
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,599
faster and don't expend energy on things

184
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,359
like walking

185
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,439
cattle in a factory farm that never get

186
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,079
to roam pastures can sometimes be less

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,318
destructive for the climate than cattle

188
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,478
grazing peacefully on a formerly lush

189
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,719
piece of rainforest

190
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,478
but isn't it a bit out of touch with

191
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,598
reality to demonize cows so much

192
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,439
some of the land these animals are

193
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,359
grazing on isn't suitable for crops

194
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,318
anyway

195
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,638
by grazing on pastures they can turn

196
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,439
things we can't digest into food

197
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,279
isn't farming animals just a smart way

198
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,959
to make the best use of unused resources

199
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,318
three don't cows mainly use land that we

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,318
can't use for agriculture or other

201
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,159
things

202
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,239
about half of the world's ice and desert

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,318
free land is used for agriculture an

204
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,399
area the size of the entire americas

205
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,359
plus china half of all agriculturally

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,999
used land is dedicated to animals

207
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,038
most of it is grassland 65 of which

208
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,198
cannot be converted to cropland so

209
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,198
pasturing animals is actually a very

210
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,198
efficient way to use those areas since

211
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,839
we can't grow human food there anyway

212
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,359
there are a couple of catches here

213
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,638
though

214
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,799
while the idea of cows turning useless

215
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,519
grass into steak is nice it is part of a

216
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,598
marketing lie

217
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,079
even though it is so massive pastureland

218
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,999
alone can't support the ruminants living

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,959
on it

220
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,478
globally grazing systems sustain only 13

221
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,999
of beef production

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,198
so if we were to switch to 100 grass-fed

223
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,478
we'd simply have to eat much less beef

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,719
in the u.s beef production would crash

225
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,038
by some 70 percent if it were to

226
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,999
exclusively rely on grass

227
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,638
the only way to sustain our high demand

228
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,038
for meat is by growing crops and feeding

229
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,878
them to our cattle

230
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,038
and we haven't even talked about chicken

231
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,839
and pigs which exclusively eat feed

232
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,199
crops

233
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,439
because of this feed demand less than

234
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,359
half of the world's cereals are used

235
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,598
directly as human food

236
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,158
41 is fed to animals

237
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,319
the same is true for soy

238
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,838
there's a lot of talk about amazon

239
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,159
deforestation for soy production which

240
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,039
makes us think of soy milk and tofu

241
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,838
but only 19 of global soy production

242
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,079
goes towards products for humans

243
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,759
about 77

244
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,398
is used to feed animals

245
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,719
besides land without food crops isn't

246
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,199
automatically ecologically useless a

247
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,119
beef free diet would free up around 2

248
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,599
billion hectares a vegan diet would free

249
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,879
up around 3 billion hectares of land

250
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,199
we could use this land to grow forests

251
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,759
or restore wild grasslands basically

252
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,599
anything that could suck carbon out of

253
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,879
the atmosphere

254
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,639
if we spent three billion hectares of

255
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,719
land it could remove about eight billion

256
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,359
tons of co2 from the air per year by

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,599
comparison we emit about 50 billion tons

258
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,359
of co2 equivalents per year at the

259
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,999
moment that means we could save 16 of

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,119
emissions by eating a vegan diet okay

261
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,799
to summarize

262
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,679
food is a huge driver of emissions

263
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,239
meat but especially beef is the worst

264
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,319
food in terms of emissions

265
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,919
buying locally does not have a big

266
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,999
impact on food emissions compared to the

267
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,999
type of food you're consuming

268
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,079
when it comes to beef cattle that are

269
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,919
grass-fed can sometimes even be

270
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,919
counterproductive because they just need

271
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,599
much more land

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,799
even if you find the most

273
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,559
environmentally friendly beef in the

274
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,639
world your burger still comes with a

275
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,719
significantly higher carbon footprint

276
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,479
than a veggie patty

277
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,398
you can decide for yourself what you

278
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
want to do with this information

279
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,799
in fact you are always only one decision

280
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,958
away from making a change you could

281
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,039
start learning a new skill or dive into

282
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,078
a new interest today it's up to you if

283
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,319

lots of forgotten dinosaurs and other

323
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,599
