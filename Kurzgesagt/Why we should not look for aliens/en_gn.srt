1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,120
the universe is incredibly big and seems

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,440
full of potential for life with billions

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,440
of habitable planets

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,599
if an advanced civilization had the

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,920
technology to travel between the stars

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,240
at just 0.1 percent of the speed of

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,880
light it could colonize our galaxy in

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,480
roughly 100 million years

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,320
which is not that long given the

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,680
billions of years the milky way has

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,679
existed so in principle any space faring

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,719
civilization should be able to spread

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,239
rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,120
and yet we see nothing hear nothing

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
the universe seems empty devoid of

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,042
others

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,960
this is the fermi paradox which we've

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,879
discussed in more detail in other videos

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,320
confronted with the seemingly empty

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,320
universe humanity faces a dilemma

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,559
we desperately want to know if we are

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,800
alone in the milky way we want to call

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,800
out and reveal ourselves to anyone

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,399
watching but that could be the last

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,920
thing we ever do

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,320
because maybe the universe is not empty

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
maybe it's full of civilizations but

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,320
they are hiding from each other

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,880
maybe the civilizations that attracted

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,119
attention in the past were wiped away by

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,680
invisible arrows

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,0021
this is the dark forest solution to the

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,0021
fermi paradox

34
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,025
[Music]

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,880
the way of life

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,960
the hunter awakes in his hiding place

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,280
and carefully listens for suspicious

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,119
noises from the thick undergrowth before

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,041
he gets up

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,479
another night has passed without

41
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:46,240
incident

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,240
the forest is dark and full of fog

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,920
he considers calling out to others to

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,640
end his loneliness

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,0056
but stops himself at the last moment

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,0056
what if they are like him

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,240
all living things seek to survive secure

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,320
resources and multiply

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,719
their greatest obstacle are other living

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,640
things that share the same objective

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
competition between species favored the

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,919
survival of beings with advantageous

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
traits

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,280
our ancestors were inventive competitive

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
expansionist and greedy for resources

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,640
which led them to winning the

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,280
competition for our planet

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,360
today most other animals are so utterly

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
at our mercy that we wipe out about a

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,840
dozen species a day just as an

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
unintentional byproduct of how we like

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,034
to run things

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,480
but humans are more than individuals

64
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:38,400
from us cultures emerge that also

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,879
compete with each other

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,599
competitive and expansionary cultures

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,239
spread faster and further and merge with

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,160
subdue or destroy others

69
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,280
if we look at our history it becomes

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,720
clear we are dangerous

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,800
not just to others but also to ourselves

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,360
our human nature has driven us to take

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,920
over every corner of our planet and soon

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,319
we will look to the stars both to expand

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,760
our domain and ensure access to ever

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,400
more resources

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,011
and then we might stumble upon others

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,760
trying to do the same thing

79
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:17,017
it's likely that the competition of life

80
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,360
also takes place on far away planets so

81
00:03:17,017 --> 00:03:21,440
it's logical to assume that an alien

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,920
civilization that came to dominate their

83
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,025
planet would be in some regards similar

84
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,200
to us

85
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:28,319
but if they're similar to us

86
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
they too

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,200
may be dangerous

88
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,640
the implication

89
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:39,599
as the hunter sneaks through the dark

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,519
forest all alone he knows that there

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,840
might be others like him

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,560
he can't know their intentions if they

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,879
are aggressive or not

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,920
the hunter knows he would kill to ensure

95
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,959
his own survival so he has to assume

96
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,360
that they would too

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,799
and it might be that if he stumbles upon

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,439
another hunter the one that shoots first

99
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,439
survives

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,159
none of this means that conflict is

101
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,010
unavoidable so far the progress of the

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,799
modern world seems to have made us more

103
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,014
peaceful not more violent

104
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,400
maybe this is true for other

105
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:20,239
civilizations too that eventually

106
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,478
progress means less conflict not more

107
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,119
different alien civilizations also

108
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,840
should vary from the mild and peaceful

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
to the malevolent and

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,800
militaristic

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
the existential problem we're facing is

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,880
that when we meet others between the

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,880
stars we have no way of telling who is

114
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,880
peaceful or aggressive and what their

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,199
true intentions are

116
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,440
similarly they might not understand or

117
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,440
trust our intentions even if we tell

118
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,759
them that we are peaceful

119
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,759
on top of that if we did discover

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,0052
another civilization and they discovered

121
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
us the light years between us would mean

122
00:04:52,0052 --> 00:04:56,160
years of communication delay

123
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,720
both sides would be in a state of

124
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
uncertainty wondering if the wisest move

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,960
is to just attack because there's

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,005
another serious issue technological

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
explosions and the first strike

128
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,400
advantage

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
we don't know where the limits of

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,840
technology are but we do know how much

131
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,479
technological progress matters in war

132
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,120
a few hundred or thousand years can turn

133
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,199
conflict with uncertain results into a

134
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,680
one-sided massacre

135
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,759
caesar's legions would stand no chance

136
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,840
against napoleon's army with their

137
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
cannons and muskets

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,440
which would be eradicated by artillery

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
from the first world war

140
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,240
which would not stand a chance against

141
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
today's drones and guided missiles

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,160
so the power level of different

143
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,400
civilizations may vary massively and

144
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
even if not between the time it takes us

145
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,199
to detect another civilization and us

146
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,120
saying hi we might already be hopelessly

147
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
behind on the tech tree

148
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,320
which is bad enough but the nature of

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,560
interstellar conflict makes this worse

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,280
if your opponent is light years away

151
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,440
sending an invasion fleet takes so long

152
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,160
that by the time it arrives it might be

153
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,800
hopelessly obsolete

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
so war between civilizations might be

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,680
just about eliminating the other to

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,600
remove an existential threat to yourself

157
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,758
someone else who might be so scared of

158
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,520
you that they attack the first chance

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,120
they get

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,120
in this environment the only way to

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
guarantee a win is to strike with such

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
force and speed that the target has no

163
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,600
chance of survival or time to

164
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,800
counter-attack or escape to seek revenge

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,360
later

166
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,199
the stakes are the highest possible with

167
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,720
no room for error

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,800
if we assume that the majority of

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
civilizations live on planets that

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,720
leaves them pretty vulnerable all you

171
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,280
need to do is throw something massive at

172
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
a planet to make it uninhabitable

173
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
so the ultimate interplanetary

174
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,560
annihilation weapon is probably

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,360
something like a relativistic kill

176
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120
vehicle a missile shot at a planet at a

177
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
significant fraction of the speed of

178
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
light

179
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,520
for example a missile the size of a

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,0002
person going 95 the speed of light has

181
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
as much energy as all nuclear bombs on

182
00:07:02,0002 --> 00:07:04,319
earth

183
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479
if you shot a few dozen at the

184
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,880
civilization you wanted to wipe out

185
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,440
success would be fairly certain even a

186
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,319
single hit would suffice

187
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,120
this is not that absurd of an idea

188
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,120
a civilization only slightly above us on

189
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,198
the kardashev scale would have enough

190
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,198
energy to send multiple strikes against

191
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,720
every planet it suspects of harboring

192
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,199
life

193
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,680
what makes these weapons so sinister is

194
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,840
how much they favor a first strike since

195
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,520
they would be so fast that it might be

196
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,035
impossible to protect yourself

197
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,319
effectively against them once they're

198
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:38,479
launched

199
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,479
conflict between civilizations may not

200
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,800
be lengthy affairs but rapid winner

201
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,879
takes all situations where the first one

202
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,960
to shoot wins

203
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,919
this makes any civilization an

204
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,0052
existential threat to any other

205
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,319
and if every civilization is an

206
00:07:52,0052 --> 00:07:56,879
existential threat to every other there

207
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,319
may be only two kinds of civilizations

208
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
out there quiet ones and

209
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
dead ones

210
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,560
so

211
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
what should we do

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,240
should we worry

213
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,840
it's unlikely that anybody has noticed

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
humanity yet

215
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,520
the radio signals we've transmitted in

216
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,758
the last 100 years travelled a

217
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,560
relatively tiny distance and have long

218
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,879
decayed into unreadable noise

219
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,960
at our technological stage if we don't

220
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,960
actively try to get noticed and if

221
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,199
nobody specifically looks at our pretty

222
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,560
unremarkable solar system will stay

223
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,639
hidden

224
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,360
but one day we will venture into space

225
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,036
in a serious way and need to consider

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,479
these kinds of questions again

227
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:41,041
we don't know if there are others or if

228
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,519
we are going through the forest alone

229
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:45,600
but we have no way of knowing for sure

230
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,0048
for the time being it seems the best we

231
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,0050
can do is to carefully listen

232
00:08:48,0048 --> 00:08:51,920
and even if we see others step into a

233
00:08:50,0050 --> 00:08:54,054
clearing and make themselves known we

234
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
should not reply right away but

235
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:56,560
carefully watch them from the

236
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,800
undergrowth

237
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,880
perhaps we are also thinking about this

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
all wrong by allowing our primitive

239
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,120
brain that evolved in the context of the

240
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,240
gruesome competition of life to conjure

241
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,680
fears of predatory aliens all around us

242
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,760
maybe the fact that we are looking at

243
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,320
the universe like this is a sign that we

244
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,016
are not grown up yet as a species

245
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,398
there could be a friendly welcoming

246
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:20,959
community of alien civilizations waiting

247
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,279
to hear from us when we are ready

248
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,279
as for now the good news is there is

249
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,959
actually little we need to do

250
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,200
we just need to be thoughtful about the

251
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,200
signals we send out into the galaxy we

252
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,800
need to watch the sky and learn more

253
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,560
about our galaxy our forest

254
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,839
because whatever the nature of our

255
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,959
forest is

256
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
full of dangers or friends or nobody at

257
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,200
all

258
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,240
only careful observation can tell

259
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,560
so

260
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,680
let's do that

261
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,440
at last the hunter reaches a clearing

262
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,880
and finds a comfortable position

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,480
slowly the sun melts the fog away

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,240
lost in thought

265
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,360
he admires the vegetation until suddenly

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,011
he is eye to eye with another hunter

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,839
frozen in terror just like himself

268
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:16,016
his mind is racing considering all the

269
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,959
different options

270
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:22,320
the hunter takes a deep breath

271
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,800
and makes a decision

272
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,839
maybe the only way out of the dark

273
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,640
forest

274
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:33,279
is to step into the clearing together

275
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,399
and with this hopeful picture we say

276
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,120
goodbye to the year 12021 of the human

277
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,120
era it was a wild year to say the least

278
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,440
still much more fun than twelve thousand

279
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,760
and twenty quadsquezak had its most

280
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,760
successful month ever and published a

281
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,760
book we tried a lot of new techniques

282
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,440
and really got into blender and cinema

283
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,0056
4d hiding more and more 3d in our videos

284
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
we have so many ideas for next year and

285
00:10:56,0056 --> 00:11:00,399
big and ambitious plans that we can't

286
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,120
wait to share with you

287
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,920
and all of this was and is possible

288
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,009
because of your direct support

289
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,640
thank you so much kotzkuzak only works

290
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,560
because of you

291
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,560
so in tune with the end of the year

292
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,880
we've designed a few products that will

293
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,760
help you to visualize your place in the

294
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,519
universe our very shiny the night sky

295
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,519
poster shows you the little piece of

296
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,026
space we can see from earth with our own

297
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,028
eyes or travel further out with our

298
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:29,600
stellar zoom collection that depicts our

299
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:30,959
home in space from an increasing

300
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,839
distance

301
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,399
or dream with our space themed notebooks

302
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,399
scenic posters and pins

303
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,240
we design and produce every single

304
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,760
product with great care

305
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
getting something from our shop is the

306
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,240
best way to support kotskazaks

307
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,0050
we hope you have a wonderful end of the

308
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,480
year and the 12022 is more fun and less

309
00:11:50,0050 --> 00:11:56,056
exciting than the last two years

310
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,056
thank you for watching

311
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:09,309
me

312
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:09,309
[Music]

313
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
