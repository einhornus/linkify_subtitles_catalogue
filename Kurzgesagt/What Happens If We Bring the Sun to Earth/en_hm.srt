1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,719
What would happen if you were to bring 
a tiny piece of the Sun to Earth?

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,419
Short answer: you die.
Long answer: it depends which piece of the Sun.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:16,959
Like most of the matter in the universe, 
our Sun is neither solid, liquid or gas, but plasma.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,559
Plasma is when stuff is so hot that the nuclei and electrons can separate and flow around freely,
which creates a goo like substance.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,199
So, you can imagine our Sun as an extremely big, spherical ocean of very hot goo.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,999
The deeper you, go the denser and weirder the goo becomes.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:53,339
So let's bring 3 samples (each the size of a house), 
to our lab here on Earth and see what happens.

8
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,339
First sample: 
the chromosphere.

9
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,639
The chromosphere is the atmosphere of the Sun, 
a layer of sparse gas up to 5,000 kilometers deep,

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,299
that's covered in a forest of plasma spikes that can be almost as big as Earth.

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,279
It's pretty hot here between 6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius, but if we brought a solvent of it to Earth,

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,559
we're not really getting our money's worth.

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,079
Where we take our sample, the chromosphere is over a million times less dense than air.

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,999
So, compared to our atmosphere at sea level,
it's basically the same as bringing the vacuum of space down to Earth.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,479
The moment our sample arrives, it would immediately be crushed by Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:40,479
Air would rush to fill the vacuum and use as much energy as 12 kilograms of TNT in the process.

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,608
This creates a high pressure shockwave, which shatters glass, ruptures ear drums,

18
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:51,639
and maybe some internal organs. If you're standing too close it could kill you, so you'd better keep your distance

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,979
Let's go deeper.

20
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,979
Second sample, the photosphere

21
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,219
Beneath the chromosphere, is the glowing surface of the Sun: the photosphere, which produces the light we see.

22
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,939
It's covered in a grid of a million hot spots called granules. Each of them about as big as the United States,

23
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,859
and over 5,000 degrees Celsius.

24
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:19,268
These granules are the tops of convective columns, churning gas that brings the heat up from the center of the Sun to its surface.

25
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:27,179
In these columns, a few hundred kilometres down, we take our second plasma sample. It has about the same pressure as our atmosphere on earth

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,399
Though still much less dense for there. Its heat supports it, so it won't implode.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,029
Our sphere now carries twice as much energy, as much as 25 kilograms of TNT, that this time as heat.

28
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,999
For a dazzling instant, this plasma would glow with a million times the brightness of the Sun seen from Earth,

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,318
instantly lighting fires throughout our lab, but a few milliseconds later. Those fires are all that's left.

30
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,949
The plasma has cooled to harmless gas, floating up from the flaming ruins.

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,739
What if we go deeper?

32
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,239
Third sample. The radiative zone.

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:11,018
Here, the plasma is about two million degrees Celsius, and so dense and tightly packed, that it creates a sort of maze for itself.

34
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,319
Energy in the form of photons tries to escape,

35
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,939
but has to wander for hundreds of thousands of years, bouncing endlessly from particle to particle, until it eventually finds an exit.

36
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,439
Bringing matter from here to our lab, is what experts call, a very bad idea.

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,519
As soon as it arrives in our lab, the extreme pressure that holds the plasma tightly together is gone,

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:40,259
and the material explodes with the power of a thermonuclear weapon. Our lab as well as the city around it will be destroyed in an instant.

39
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,619
On the bright side, there won't be any radioactive fallout.

40
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:52,119
With our lab destroyed, we can abandon the illusion that we're trying to do any science today. What if we go much, much deeper?

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,779
Last sample. The core

42
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,859
Here in the central 1% of the star, we find a third of the sun's mass.

43
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,608
The matter here is compressed by the weight of the entire star above it. In the center of the core,

44
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:08,279
the temperature is 15 million degrees,

45
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,919
hot enough to make helium by smashing together hydrogen, powering the Sun by nuclear fusion.

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,917
In billions of years after the death of the Sun, this core will remain as a white dwarf.

47
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,179
If we brought a sample of it to Earth, it would cause a lot of inconvenience

48
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,999
The biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated, had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT, or a cube the size of the Empire State Building.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,079
Our sample has the equivalent of 4,000 megatons.

50
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,259
This is four billion tons of TNT, or a cube 1.3 kilometers high.

51
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,199
To give you a sense of scale this is the cube inside Manhattan.

52
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,959
Once the sphere arrives on Earth, this super dense matter expands instantly and creates an explosion with the force of well,

53
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,648
the Sun.

54
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:03,739
If we get the sample in Paris, in the morning the citizens of London would see what looks like a second sunrise.

55
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,979
But, one that gets brighter and brighter, and hotter and hotter, until London burns to ashes.

56
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,279
In a radius of about 300 kilometres around the blast, everything would be burnt.

57
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,818
The shockwave would travel around the Earth multiple times.

58
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:26,539
Most buildings in Central Europe would be flattened, eardrums would rupture, and windows break across the continent.

59
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,859
The explosion would be apocalyptic.

60
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,418
possibly humans civilization ending.

61
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:37,899
If humans did survive, we could count on the dust blown into the atmosphere to create a small ice age.

62
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,659
So, if there is one tiny bright side, it would be that the explosion might be an effective way to control

63
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,519
human-caused climate change for a few decades.

64
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,940
While this is definitely a good thing, all in all we conclude, that we should not try to bring the Sun to earth
