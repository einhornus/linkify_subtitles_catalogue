1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,198
one of the greatest illusions in life is

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,358
continuity 66 million years ago

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,678
the continuity of the dinosaurs had been

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,399
going on for around

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,718
165 million years already and it didn't

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,319
seem this would change anytime

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,118
soon the world was warm and pleasant and

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,038
most of the land was covered with lush

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,759
forests

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,479
and an incredible diversity of trees

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,358
flowers

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,479
ferns and trillions of critters

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,719
dinosaurs were ubiquitous and had

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,119
diversified into hundreds of species of

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,359
all shapes and sizes

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,479
titanators large gentle giants shared

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,238
the world with famous beasts like

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,679
tyrannosaurus rex

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,759
or edmontosaurus hectinodon hunted in

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,799
the undergrowth

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,679
while edmontosaurus wandered coastlines

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,279
and swamps

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,279
an ancient paradise a world of plenty

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,599
full of life 66 million years ago

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,999
maybe on a tuesday afternoon life was

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,399
the same as it had been the day before

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,639
or a thousand years before or pretty

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,478
much a million years before

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,999
things were good for our feathered

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,519
dinosaur buddies

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,798
until a tiny tiny detail in the sky

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,360
changed

33
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,610
[Music]

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,478
if there were dinosaurs watching the

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,919
stars one night

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,758
they may have noticed the appearance of

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,999
a new star a tiny dot

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,639
that for many weeks slowly became bigger

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,239
and brighter

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,719
until one fateful day it looked like

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,519
another

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,879
small moon in the night sky and then

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,438
it faded from sight as it dipped into

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,798
earth's shadow

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,118
for a few more hours the illusion of

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,239
continuity

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,158
was upheld until it was not anymore

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,919
in the morning the object suddenly

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,199
appears again

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,519
now almost as large as the sun in the

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,679
sky and growing every moment

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,839
heading for the coast near the yucatan

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,118
peninsula

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,359
it takes the asteroid only seconds to

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,877
pass through the thin layer between

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,079
space and the ground

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,479
to make contact as it enters the

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,199
atmosphere

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,359
at almost 60 times the speed of sound

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,639
let's stop time here we see the unnamed

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,519
asteroid

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,878
about to commit specieside

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,958
larger than mount everest it reaches

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,999
from the ocean

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,079
high into the atmosphere higher than

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,919
passenger planes would fly millions of

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,359
years later

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,318
at this moment the world was one way in

69
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,759
a fraction of a second

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,318
it would be fundamentally different

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,399
let's make the transition

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,559
as the asteroid hits the shallow ocean

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,839
and the bedrock below

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,839
the energy of billions of nuclear

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,039
weapons is released

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,119
all at once as the asteroid vaporizes

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,759
a flash of light illuminates the sky as

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,238
an eerie bright white sphere grows over

79
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,999
the gulf of mexico

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,719
bedrock melts into seething hot plasma

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,079
at tens of thousands

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,199
of degrees celsius the thermal radiation

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,238
from the explosion

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,079
travels at the speed of light and

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,999
immediately burns everything within a

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,598
radius of about one thousand

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,759
five hundred kilometers while the energy

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,639
from the impact

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,119
pushes so hard against earth's crust

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,799
that it loses all strength

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,199
and flows away from the impact site like

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,999
a liquid

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,878
creating a hole 25 kilometers deep and

94
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,359
100 kilometers wide

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,439
the ocean is pushed back for hundreds of

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,679
kilometers like when a kid jumps into a

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,878
puddle

98
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,679
as the crust bounces back melted and

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,158
flowing crust forms a temporary mountain

100
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,359
stretching 10 kilometers into the sky an

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,679
incredible amount of material is blasted

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,119
into the higher atmosphere

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,158
or even out into space as much as 60

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,199
times the original mass of the asteroid

105
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,279
the violence of the strike is felt

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,079
everywhere on earth within minutes

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,559
a magnitude 11 earthquake may be the

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,798
most powerful quake any living thing has

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,759
ever witnessed

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,359
in billions of years it is so insanely

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,999
strong

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,919
that in india it might have shaken

113
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,518
gigantic lava fields

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,839
and causes volcanic eruptions that would

115
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,958
last for 30

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,357
000 years and cover half of the indian

117
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,357
subcontinent with lava

118
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,119
even on the side of earth opposite the

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,478
impact the ground

120
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,439
still moved by several meters nobody

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,399
would sleep through this day

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,879
the gigantic explosion crashes against

123
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,918
the atmosphere with

124
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,079
unprecedented violence and causes a

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,999
shock wave that reaches speeds of more

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,239
than 1 000 kilometers per hour near the

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,359
site of impact

128
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,439
similar to the hyper hurricanes on gas

129
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,679
giants like neptune

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,079
in middle america basically any soil

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,879
vegetation

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,599
or animal is just shredded into pieces

133
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,679
and catapulted thousands of kilometers

134
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,879
away

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,959
now the previously displaced oceans

136
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,198
return as the temporary mountain at the

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,719
site of impact collapses

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,638
a ring of tsunamis as high as one

139
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,319
kilometer enough to cover all

140
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,319
skyscrapers humans would ever build

141
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,879
heads in all directions as they crash

142
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,478
into the coasts of the continents

143
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,559
surrounding the impact they will drown

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,279
thousands of kilometers of coastline

145
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,918
15 hours later some of the waves that

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,999
get refracted around south america

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,719
will still tower as much as 100 meters

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,079
into the sky

149
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,359
but we still haven't talked about the

150
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,119
worst thing yet

151
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,359
a lot of the debris heated into space

152
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,918
will orbit earth for thousands of years

153
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,959
some may hit the moon or even mars

154
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,439
but most of it comes right back when

155
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,038
things fall through the atmosphere at

156
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:37,999
such speed

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,478
they get very hot as in hundreds of

158
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,679
degrees hot

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,839
and this happens to millions of tons of

160
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,758
material everywhere

161
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,079
this rapidly heats up the atmosphere to

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,799
insane

163
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,038
temperatures we don't know exactly how

164
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,198
hot it got or how long this heat shock

165
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,758
lasted but there are two ideas here

166
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,839
either the air was heated to hundreds of

167
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,279
degrees for a few minutes

168
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,679
or two thousands of degrees for around

169
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,559
one minute

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,799
in any case the air became as hot as the

171
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,999
inside of an industrial

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,959
oven how bad the global effects of this

173
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,318
were is contested

174
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,478
but if enough heat reached the surface a

175
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,239
lot of plants and animals would have

176
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,638
died

177
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,239
very quickly if they couldn't bury

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,959
themselves or escape into caves

179
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,959
the heat together with raining debris

180
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,439
also may have ignited material on forest

181
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,159
floors

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,799
and sparked wildfires as the earth

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,519
rotated

184
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,999
under the searing hot blue in a few

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,719
hours

186
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,799
massive wildfires were probably burning

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,159
around the globe

188
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,079
some of them may have lasted for months

189
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,198
and turned earth

190
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,079
into a horrifying hot hellish version of

191
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,119
itself

192
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,599
as the day of the impact draws to an end

193
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,079
many of the dinosaurs are already dead

194
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,119
but the worst is still to come

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,679
the gigantic plume of vaporized material

196
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,359
reaches the upper atmosphere

197
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,918
and spreads around the whole globe

198
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,598
together with the soot from the burning

199
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,399
planet

200
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,359
and the aerosols generated at impact the

201
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,758
planet sinks into a deep darkness

202
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,999
with only the remaining raging fires

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,999
illuminating the scenery

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,719
whatever plants survive the firestorms

205
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,799
will now be starved for sunlight

206
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,359
as global photosynthesis is temporarily

207
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,478
shut down

208
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,959
within days temperatures crash as much

209
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,679
as 25 degrees celsius

210
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,559
the oceans were especially hard hit the

211
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,038
lack of sunlight killed over 90 percent

212
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,839
of plankton

213
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,918
which formed the basis of the food web

214
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,198
of marine life

215
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,439
ultimately this would kill off the large

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,559
marine reptiles

217
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,719
and ammonites that used to dominate the

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,839
seas

219
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,999
the biosphere the survivors now find

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,959
themselves in

221
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,399
is like an alien landscape ash debris

222
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,239
and the burned remains of the formerly

223
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,918
lush and blooming life

224
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,719
cover the ground the sky is dark and

225
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,758
it's cold

226
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,478
and fresh food is scarce while fungi

227
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,918
thrive

228
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,239
for months and years the planet will be

229
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,198
a hostile

230
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,918
and deadly place the sudden global

231
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,559
winter

232
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,839
will last for decades at least 75

233
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,559
percent of

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,279
all species on earth will just vanish

235
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,959
from existence

236
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,999
and so as the day ends the world

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,119
is suddenly different the continuity

238
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,279
that went on for millions of years

239
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,719
is no more the era of the dinosaurs

240
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,878
is over just like that

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,878
eventually from the ashes of the old

242
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,359
world survivors emerged

243
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,518
birds that are the direct descendants of

244
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,478
the dinosaurs

245
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,718
and mammals that would eventually become

246
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,119
the dominant animals on the planet

247
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,678
without the asteroid who knows what life

248
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,598
on earth would look like today

249
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,439
without the sudden disruption of

250
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,119
dinosaur continuity

251
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,199
that completely changed the planet and

252
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,559
all life on it

253
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,479
we might have never had the opportunity

254
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,679
to become what we are today

255
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,079
it's not clear how long the human error

256
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,199
will last

257
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,518
so far modern humans have been around

258
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,919
for 0.1 percent of the time the

259
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,439
dinosaurs were

260
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,599
and in this short amount of time we've

261
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,359
achieved impressive feats

262
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,679
from making the world our own to

263
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,719
reaching space

264
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,919
and splitting the atom yet our future

265
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,639
and our long-term survival are not a

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,599
given

267
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,079
if we're not careful it could end in an

268
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,879
instant

269
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,759
like the age of the dinosaurs ended but

270
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,119
in contrast to them

271
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,759
we know that our continuity is fragile

272
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,159
even if it doesn't feel like it

273
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,199
we can be prepared and be vigilant and

274
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,079
hopeful

275
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,199
if we're lucky our journey will go on

276
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,120
for a long long time

277
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,759
speaking of journeys we want to address

278
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,319
something in the spirit of transparency

279
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,559
koskazak has changed in the last two

280
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,799
years we've become more than a youtube

281
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,639
channel or animation studio

282
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,719
and now also run a paper shop that sells

283
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,479
hundreds of thousands of calendars

284
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,439
posters and notebooks that's not a happy

285
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,999
accident

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,679
many of us have a background in graphic

287
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,398
design paper products are our roots

288
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,239
and we actually started out creating

289
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,439
posters books and print infographics

290
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,278
we love that you can touch them smell

291
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,278
them nerd about small details and

292
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,719
printing techniques

293
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,879
just like the channel we started small

294
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,639
and without great ambition

295
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,119
step by step we found the right printers

296
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,838
and papers

297
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,599
learned about shipping and expanded our

298
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,838
shop we put a huge amount of research

299
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,159
love and hours into it because this is

300
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,319
the only way we know how to do things

301
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,319
we don't just want to make generic merge

302
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,838
we want to make things that fit our

303
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,078
mission of making science exciting

304
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,879
and creating beautiful things things

305
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,838
that persist

306
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,879
and are made with high quality and love

307
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,119
our shop gives us another outlet to do

308
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,359
this and as a nice side effect

309
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,199
has turned into our main source of

310
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,278
income for everything we do on this

311
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:53,999
channel

312
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,559
which also keeps us independent and our

313
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,639
videos free for everyone

314
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,958
so we want to build further on that and

315
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,518
create more things that last

316
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,679
we've just started a new notebook line

317
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,719
called pocket log

318
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,039
that will expand on in the future the

319
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,639
first edition is a dinosaur themed

320
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,239
collection that will hopefully serve a

321
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,319
future paleontologist well

322
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,159
there are loads of plans for sciencey

323
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,759
stuff more journals and

324
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,879
calendars and infographics let us know

325
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,319
what you would like us to make

326
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,039
for your room kids classrooms and

327
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,799
yourself

328
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,199
in the end the things we do work because

329
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,999
you like them

330
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,759
and because you enable us to put

331
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,599
thousands of hours into videos

332
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,838
and hundreds of hours into posters and

333
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,879
journals

334
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,958
thank you so much for that we're looking

335
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,199
forward to making fun sciency stuff for

336
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,518
you

337
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,759
no matter if it's a video a poster or

338
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,439
something else entirely

339
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:57,689
thank you for watching

340
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,719
[Music]

341
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
you
