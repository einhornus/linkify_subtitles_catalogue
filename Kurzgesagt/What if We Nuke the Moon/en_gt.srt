1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:06,428
What would happen if we detonated a very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon?

2
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:11,900
Will it blast its orbit towards Earth, causing a huge tsunami and disaster?

3
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:25,498
Could it be that after the moon was blown up, countless debris bathed the earth in a deadly meteor shower?

4
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:32,449
The moon has been the main space exploration site since the cold war, you know, for more military bases

5
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,807
so the US Air Force commissioned  A neglected study was conducted to understand

6
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,158
the effects of nuclear explosions on the lunar surface.  But just quotes are boring

7
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:48,298
so let's do a very important science experiment with a 100 megaton hydrogen

8
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,500
bomb that will be twice as powerful as the most powerful bomb ever detonated

9
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:56,849
and will also find a few curious  Hearty astronauts to act as observers

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:04,098
Let's hit the detonator button and slow down.  For the first few milliseconds from the outside,

11
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:11,798
nothing happened.  But at the same time, the high explosives inside have sent shock waves to the radioactive metal,

12
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,749
compressing it to a critical point, so that the chain reaction of nuclear fusion can begin.

13
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,800
In this first stage, a plasma of up to 100 million degrees is generated, which also triggers the second stage.

14
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:26,719
At this time  Nuclei fuse as in the core of a star.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,508
For a split second, our guys encapsulate one of the hottest places in the universe

16
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:38,789
and now, just 10 microseconds later, the whole universe notices

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,689
something is happening.  Planet Is Born

18
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,000
So far so good!  But everything that starts to happen now will be very different from what we know on Earth

19
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:54,429
for one major reason: the moon has no atmosphere and

20
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:02,998
as the fireball unleashes flashes of X-rays and fiery photons, a silent wave of heat rushes outward towards  In all directions

21
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:11,790
on Earth, this heat wave will burn anything within a 50-kilometer radius beyond recognition

22
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:16,001
. Not only on the moon, there is no such thing as burning without an oxygen-filled atmosphere, and nothing can burn the

23
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:25,692
moon's crunchy topsoil.  Silicate rock and metal composition.  These metals have been smashed into dust by countless meteorites for many years, and mixed with a small amount of water

24
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:30,905
. At the same time as the explosion brings high temperature, the X-rays emitted by the fireball will evaporate a layer of thin rock on the surface of the moon,

25
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:35,001
and the poor dust inside the fireball will be melted into glass.

26
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:37,538
Any astronaut who sees a good show within 50 kilometers

27
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,418
will be fried to a crispy crunch with furious fire.

28
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:46,818
Now, we can witness the most striking difference compared to the explosion of the

29
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,249
earth. The atmosphere on earth resists that giant plasma bubble

30
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:57,758
Atmospheric pressure would violently and violently prevent the explosion from expanding.  But this is not good news.

31
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,840
While the fireball slammed back into the atmosphere, it also created the most destructive part of a nuclear explosion on Earth: the

32
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,840
compressed air around the shock wave explosion would rush outwards at supersonic speeds and

33
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:12,689
smash buildings.  Shattered physical organs

34
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,850
but no shock waves on the moon.  No atmosphere means nothing to stop the explosion from expanding

35
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:22,978
on the moon, because there is no atmosphere to hinder or a fireball that produces a sound

36
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:27,399
explosion just grows in a weird and quiet way

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,508
. It can be very impressive to watch from a safe distance.  The

38
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:35,839
surprising thing is that there is almost no "safe viewing distance" for a lunar nuclear explosion. There is

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,300
no lethal ionizing radiation that can disrupt DNA in a weakened atmosphere.

40
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:47,799
Anyone seeking a great viewing position will be exposed to lethal amounts of radiation.  Down.  And of course, the good drama was just about to kick in

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,898
when the explosion hit the moon like a giant hammer.

42
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:57,689
About one-tenth of the energy was converted into seismic waves, which produced powerful moonquakes.

43
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:05,049
The moon is much smaller than the earth, so no matter where the astronauts stand, they will feel a violent shaking that cannot be ignored. If you

44
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,567
compare the earthquake with a magnitude of 7 on the Richter scale,

45
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:14,079
such an earthquake will seriously damage our infrastructure on the moon.  Even razed to the ground.

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,328
Those hiding on the far side of the moon wouldn't realize that it all stemmed from an explosion. The

47
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,938
shaking felt like being hit by an asteroid the size of the Pyramid

48
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:29,758
of Guf.  Local soil splattered like a splash of a stone thrown into water.

49
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,537
When the explosion pushed the surface, up to 100 million cubic meters of dust and rock could be excavated to

50
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:42,018
form a one-kilometer-wide crater.  The rock is smashed into rubble

51
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:46,109
and the wreckage shoots into the sky in all directions.

52
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,349
Similarly, without the interference of the atmosphere, the wreckage rushes out as if it were no one.

53
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,028
Many sparse wreckage will never return to the moon.  The high speed of escape velocity flew far into the distance. A

54
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,499
series of snowflake-like micrometeorites flew out to start the journey of the solar system.

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,618
Many of them will fall to Earth like rain, but few are larger than ordinary pebbles.

56
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:11,799
Anything blocking the flight direction of these debris  Satellites, astronauts, or space stations are likely to

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,719
be shot at different velocities and angles.

58
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,038
This makes them scatter like bullets on the lunar surface

59
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:24,208
, no matter where our curious astronauts are.  In the

60
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:31,848
end, the explosion came to an end.  On Earth, the fireball takes off like a hot air balloon and turns into a stalk.

61
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:37,059
When it reaches a certain height, the surrounding cold air is continuously sucked in, and the top becomes a mushroom cloud.

62
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,254
But on the moon, well...you  Also got it: no atmosphere, no mushroom cloud.

63
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:48,020
As the plasma ball gets bigger, it cools down, which means less energy for it to pull off some fun or scary tricks

64
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:53,428
after it all starts.  Within a few seconds, this huge bubble turns red and then disappears from view.

65
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:59,449
What can be seen on Earth, like a twinkling star, then immediately disappears

66
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,768
. It flashes quietly, and nothing happens.

67
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,802
The myriad of tiny debris fragments that reach far from the lunar surface

68
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:13,597
will be gleaming in the sun for a few minutes, bringing an eerie aesthetic to anyone who stays to watch the spectacle.

69
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,949
How's the moon's orbit now?  Basically unaffected.

70
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,119
Delusions of moving the moon with nukes are like blowing air on a truck and expecting it to go.

71
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:32,159
Maybe a nuclear explosion is big, but the universe is bigger.  Our powerful explosion left only a single crater.  one in millions.

72
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,748
Anyone who is on the moon next will have no good fruit to eat

73
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:39,678
. The material that ends up falling back to the moon is radioactive.

74
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:46,099
If there were no natural processes to wash it away or bury it, the lunar surface would still be contaminated.

75
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,599
Fortunately, the worst radiation would be  Attenuates

76
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,438
to levels comparable to natural levels of cosmic rays in about a year.

77
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:00,607
In conclusion, we can say with confidence that while the Moon simply doesn't care about being dropped a nuclear bomb or even notices

78
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:08,780
using the Moon as a test site for a nuclear bomb, right?  It's going to cost everyone who wants to do some research or build something useful on the moon

79
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,857
so maybe we just...

80
00:07:10,858 --> 00:08:12,699
don't do that.
