1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,319
Deep in tropical jungles lie floating kingdoms

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,659
ruled by beautiful and deadly masters.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,839
They're sort of the high elves of the ant kingdoms,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,619
talented architects that create castles

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,464
and city-states.

6
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:17,284
But they are also fierce,

7
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:19,204
and, expansionist warriors and

8
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:22,004
their kingdoms are ensnared in a never-ending

9
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:23,644
war for survival -

10
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:32,834
Oecophylla Weaver ants.

11
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:35,624
Oecophylla Weavers walk on long legs,

12
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,424
have slender bodies and large eyes which make them

13
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:41,424
look pretty cute, although their strong mandibles

14
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:44,184
and the ability to shoot acids also

15
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:46,974
make them pretty good at killing, but

16
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:48,814
more on that later.

17
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,904
Their colonies usually have two to three worker classes

18
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:55,174
that vary dramatically in size - Majors,

19
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:58,194
Minors, and sometimes, even tiny

20
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:01,094
Minim workers. Depending on location and

21
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,014
species, they vary in colour from dark brown

22
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:05,904
to emerald green.

23
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:08,284
Other than their fancy looks, what makes

24
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,234
weavers special is that they're in the kingdom building

25
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:14,584
business. They like to build at pretty much all

26
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:17,504
heights, starting in shrubs a few centimetres above the

27
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:21,284
ground, and up to ten metres in the three canopy.

28
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:24,924
But they're not satisfied with ruling just one plant.

29
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:27,244
Weavers will look for twigs or lianas

30
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,964
that bridge the gap to other tress, and expand

31
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,504
to every plant they can reach.

32
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:35,364
This way, colonies spread upwards and sideways

33
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:37,594
through the treetops.

34
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:40,614
The largest Weaver ant kingdoms we know of, occupy

35
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:43,804
up to 1600 square metres,

36
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:46,744
around four basketball courts.

37
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:49,194
A lot of ground to cover for tiny ants,

38
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:52,464
and impossibly hard to control, so

39
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:54,554
Weaver ants construct dozens of

40
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:57,464
nests, scattered all over their territory.

41
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:00,504
Outposts to defend the kingdom, tubes or

42
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:04,244
balls made from leaves and ghostly silk sheets.

43
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:07,184
These masterpieces of high-end architecture

44
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:10,114
are created by the Weaver Majors, the larger worker

45
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:13,144
ants, which are responsible for the more dangerous jobs

46
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:15,414
like fighting, foraging and

47
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,054
nest construction.

48
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,044
To start a new nest, a Major tries to bend

49
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:22,544
different leaves in her surroundings into a tube.

50
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:25,594
If one of the leaves is flexible enough, more workers will

51
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,094
arrive to help.

52
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:30,144
Chains of workers pull the leaf edges together,

53
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:33,184
or reach across gaps and grab distant leaves to

54
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,484
add them to the construction.

55
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:38,614
While the bending and pulling is going on, other workers carry

56
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:41,774
larvae from the closest nest to the construction site.

57
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,714
Usually, ant larvae spin themselves a cocoon

58
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:47,334
to protect themselves, but the Weaver ant

59
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:50,464
larvae give all of their silk to the colony

60
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:53,414
as building material. So when the workers tap

61
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:56,604
the larvae's heads on the leaf, they release their sticky thread

62
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:59,714
like tiny, cute glue guns. This way,

63
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:02,564
the workers sew the bent leaf onto itself,

64
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:04,744
so it won't unfold anymore.

65
00:03:04,745 --> 00:03:07,484
This creates a central chamber that's used

66
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:10,414
as the basis for up to three hundred more leaves that

67
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,994
are wound around it.

68
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:15,024
Together, they form little pockets, and act as

69
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:18,024
additional rooms for the new outpost. To make it even

70
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:20,974
more cozy, Minor workers use the larvae

71
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,694
to weave additional floors and chambers.

72
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:26,514
Nests are usually constructed as barracks on

73
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:29,184
the territory's borders, or as storage for brood and

74
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:32,139
food supplies. This way, the ants don't need

75
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,619
to cross vast distances to the headquarters,

76
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,279
but have soldiers close to any potential point of conflict-

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,244
apart from one special nest in the middle of the network,

78
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:44,294
which is reserved for the queen, and her guards.

79
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:47,164
Here, she produces hundreds of eggs a day, which get transferred

80
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:50,294
to suitable nests with brood chambers.

81
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:52,644
So a colony is a network of little

82
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:54,834
castles and moats, connected by

83
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,284
suspension bridges made from leaves, lianas,

84
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,084
and twigs.

85
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:01,894
An established colony easily has half a million

86
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:04,594
individuals that need to be fed.

87
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,294
Fortunately, Weaver ants evolve to have very

88
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,134
close and beneficial relationships with their hosts,

89
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:12,614
shrubs, and trees.

90
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:15,474
The tree gives the ants a home and access to

91
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:18,544
sweet sap to drink. But maybe even more importantly,

92
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:21,574
it allows them to cultivate cattle, like aphids,

93
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,354
or caterpillars that produce honey dew for them.

94
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,084
This would usually hurt a tree,

95
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:28,519
but these insects belong to a small group of

96
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,464
V.I.Ps - only a few selected neighbours

97
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:34,534
and the ants' cattle are allowed on the fruit tree.

98
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,274
Many other insects, and even larger herbivores

99
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:40,254
are scared off. Or, even killed,

100
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:42,914
and eaten. So, in most cases,

101
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,934
the tree only has to tolerate acceptable levels of

102
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:49,644
damage, while being protected from more dangerous pests.

103
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:52,694
The Weaver ant kingdom could be an ant paradise -

104
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:55,114
if there wasn't competition.

105
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:57,234
Mostly from other kingdoms,

106
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:58,814
just like medieval humans,

107
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:01,814
every queen seeks to conquer others, and make their land

108
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:02,924
their own.

109
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:05,254
Controlling fertile land is the key

110
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,254
to survive in the jungle.

111
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:10,264
And, if a kingdom loses to much of it, it shrinks and

112
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:12,954
is overrun, or starves to death.

113
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:15,984
So, expanding and defending their borders, is

114
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:18,864
critical to keep the colony alive.

115
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,774
When a kingdom invades another, it first gathers an

116
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,104
army of a few thousand Majors, who make their

117
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:27,054
way towards the opposing colony. The goal

118
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:30,814
is to steal a bit of territory, and take it over.

119
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:33,274
Defending Weaver patrols quickly spot the invaders,

120
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:36,314
and immediately release an alarm pheromone.

121
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,234
Some rush to the front to defend, while others

122
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:42,404
rush to the closest outpost for help, marking their route

123
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:43,824
with pheromones.

124
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:46,024
Whenever they meet other sisters, they jerk

125
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:49,094
their bodies as if in a fight, to signal them to follow the pheromone

126
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,544
trail to the front-line.

127
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:54,684
At the site of battle, Majors from both parties raise their

128
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:57,924
bodies, circle each other with mandibles wide open,

129
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,564
and try to seize their opponents. If

130
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,594
an ant gets a hold of her opponent, the victim is pulled into

131
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:06,784
a group of allied Majors, and pinned down.

132
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:09,814
The ants then rip the victim apart, clipping off

133
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:12,874
antennae and legs, and slicing open their

134
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,094
abdomens.

135
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:16,534
To slow down the advance of the attackers, the

136
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,504
defending Majors squirt formic acid over the battlefield

137
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,134
to chemically burn their targets.

138
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:25,854
This is soon answered in the same way by the attackers.

139
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:28,554
In the chaotic battle, both parties lose

140
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,504
countless fighters on the increasingly acidic battlefield.

141
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:35,764
After a few minutes, the backup from the outposts arrive,

142
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:38,324
and the time window for a successful attack, slowly

143
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:41,934
closes. This is when the battle turns.

144
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,384
The defenders slowly push back the attack party.

145
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:48,294
In the end, the attackers can't keep up, and have to

146
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:49,454
retreat.

147
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:52,984
For both parties, it was a costly battle.

148
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:56,064
Thousands of corpses lie piled up on the ground under the

149
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,774
battlefield, and many ants are severely injured.

150
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:02,394
The defending colony's nests and brood,

151
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:03,884
are safe though.

152
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:06,864
The attackers' attempt to steal new, valuable territory

153
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:09,774
has failed, for today. They'll try

154
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,494
again soon.

155
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:14,454
But the kingdom will be ready.

156
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:17,424
For the high ants of the floating kingdoms, war is

157
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:20,464
nothing special - it's just a fact of life,

158
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:23,394
because as we know, empires never ever

159
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:26,404
have enough, and the Weaver ants are ready

160
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,564
to fight.

161
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,454
 

162
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:34,124
 

163
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,054
 

164
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,104
 

165
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:43,124
 

166
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,334
 

167
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:49,374
 

168
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,564
 

169
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:55,624
 

170
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,644
 

171
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,424
 

172
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:04,254
 

173
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:07,114
 

174
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:10,964
 

175
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:14,584
 

176
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:17,514
 

177
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:20,544
 

178
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:21,924
 

179
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:25,094
 

180
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:27,074
 

181
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:30,074
 

182
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:33,254
 

183
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:36,283
 

184
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:39,124
 

185
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:49,154
 

186
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,365
