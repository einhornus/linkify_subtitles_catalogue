1
00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:06,798
Finding a new home in space and leaving the earth is not only a long-standing dream of individual
human beings, but will also become a necessary condition for human survival sooner or later.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,258
Mars is the planet that we humans are most concerned about.  Despite his small size, gas-filled

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,529
and energy-poor planet, that seemed like enough for a group of frustrated humans crammed into underground cities

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,538
.

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,628
But what if we think bigger?
What if we choose Venus, the most unfriendly and deadly place in the solar system,

6
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:32,758
and make it our colony?  Not to build one sky city after another,

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:47,478
but to create a suitable No. 2 Earth?  It might be easier than you think.

8
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:52,578
Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system so far discovered,

9
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:59,029
at 460째C, hot enough to melt lead.
And this heat comes from the extreme greenhouse gases in the solar system.

10
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:07,389
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is very good at trapping heat,
even if the concentration of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere only rises from 0.03% to 0.04%,

11
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,699
it is already making us feel very hot.  And CO2 accounts for 97%

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,059
of the atmosphere of Venus. In addition, the atmosphere of Venus is 93 times denser than that of the earth.
Standing on the surface of Venus is like diving into a

13
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,098
900-meter-deep sea.  Under that kind of pressure

14
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:27,098
you'd be brutally killed in no

15
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:31,188
time. What a terrible place to be!  So why are we so troublesome?

16
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:38,339
First, and foremost, Venus is almost the size of Earth
and has 90% surface gravity

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,468
Surface gravity is a very important issue when colonizing the solar system

18
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,999
because prolonged exposure to a low surface gravity environment is very likely to be detrimental to health

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,499
The size of Venus indicates that it might be the second largest habitat in the solar system

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,188
, a new home for billions of humans and trillions of animals,
with oceans, lush forests, and beautiful skies.

21
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:03,839
A well-transformed Venus might be  It's the

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,309
most beautiful place other than

23
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,089
Earth and although we can't really terraform Venus
in the future maybe a slightly more ambitious one of us can take over the project and

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,309
it will take generations to complete this grand challenge

25
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,108
Just like the pyramids built for our ancestors

26
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:25,238
This isn't the first time we've started a big project that requires more than humans

27
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,179
Ok! Let's do it!

28
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,589
At the very beginning, we had to cool down Venus
and remove the extremely heavy atmosphere that covers Venus.

29
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,480
As mentioned earlier, this gas is very large,

30
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:40,657
about 4.65 billion tons.

31
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:46,249
How to do?  We have a few options.
We could build a giant solar collector that would drive a swarm of laser beams

32
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,508
and heat the atmosphere and explode it into space,

33
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:55,728
although it would take thousands of times as much as the entire human output, and it

34
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:00,317
would take thousands of years.

35
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:06,309
Another way to remove the atmosphere is to "sequester" the atmosphere and
convert CO2 into different compounds through chemical reactions.

36
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,869
We can dig out some elements like calcium or magnesium in Mercury

37
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,899
and pass through the mass projector system - the electric orbit is in comparison.  Small planets make rockets unnecessary - shoot to Venus and the

38
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,828
metals will combine through CO2, essentially permanently synthesizing the different carbonates

39
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,388
but on a scale that makes the whole thing impractical it

40
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:35,288
will take several  It takes hundreds of billions of tons of material to isolate CO2

41
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,747
and it seems like too much waste and too much time.

42
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:44,179
Another equally crazy idea is that we can cover Venus with a shadow, literally

43
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,728
we can cover the sky with a giant mirror  sun, to cool the atmosphere

44
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,347
mirror doesn't need to be very complicated or very heavy
just a very thin foil with a little structural support

45
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:59,258
building a plane that big and so close to the sun
would actually turn it into a solar sail

46
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:04,638
and then push
so instead of using one huge circular object

47
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,918
we'll have the mirrors will have many different parts forming

48
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,988
several angled ring mirrors that will reflect sunlight from one to the other. The

49
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,487
mirrors will be angled to reflect light until  The light was redirected back

50
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,448
so that the forces were balanced and they all held their

51
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:27,989
place. After a few years of these infrastructures in place, things started slowly and then intensified.

52
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,338
In the first few decades, the atmosphere cooled slowly but remained dense.  Deadly again

53
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:40,258
until almost 60 years later, the temperature reaches a critical 31째C

54
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,758
Suddenly a massive flood falls on Venus
Carbon dioxide becomes liquid at this pressure and starts to rain

55
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,958
A global torrential rain of unbelievable scale will continue for 30 years

56
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,679
And the air pressure and temperature would suddenly start to drop together.

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,628
Nearly a century later, the puddles turned into lakes and oceans.

58
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:07,268
At this time, the surface temperature was already -56째C and the atmospheric pressure became only 7 times that of the earth.

59
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:14,119
Finally, in the very uncomfortable  -81째C, the CO2 ocean starts to freeze

60
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,768
and the rain turns to snowfall
leaving a frozen Venus covered in a rocky ocean

61
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:26,190
and huge CO2 glaciers
At almost three times Earth's pressure there is almost nothing left in the atmosphere  Nitrogenous

62
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:31,278
If you don't mind freezing or suffocation,

63
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,388
you can now walk on the surface of Venus.

64
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,539
But there are still some problems with frozen CO2.
At some point we will want to warm the planet

65
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,818
but if we do, the frozen CO2 will melt and be released into the atmosphere again

66
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:46,888
that.
So we need some way to prevent this  One thing

67
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,407
is to simply cover it all with cheap plastic insulation
and then cover it with ground Venusian rock or ocean,

68
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:56,128
although some planetary scientists will

69
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:02,429
be very nervous about us building a new planet that contains a potential ticking time bomb.

70
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,727
Some unfortunate timed volcano could melt a lot of CO2 instantly and ruin everything.

71
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:11,828
Another obvious way would be to shoot them all into space and
collect them on small satellites to store for future use.

72
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,717
We could use mass projectors more efficiently instead of rockets

73
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:21,378
but moving such a large amount would still be very powerful.  The challenge

74
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,128
and will take a while to figure out.

75
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:27,648
Whatever the problem with the air,
we need water next, from a frozen moon

76
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:34,249
Europa, a moon of Jupiter that has twice the water content of Earth's oceans

77
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,018
to grab one  It is not easy to satellite and transport him in the solar system.

78
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:44,268
So instead, it might be easier to use a lot of drones to cut ice on Europa

79
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:50,068
and shoot at Venus with more mass projectors.

80
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,078
Space tethers save us a lot of effort and energy
-- we've made a whole video explaining how they work.

81
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,128
All in all, they're slings that can carry effective loads on both ends.

82
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,878
On Europa, they would do most of the work to catapult the ice onto Venus. The

83
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:12,208
ice would hit the Venus tether, and then fall gently into the atmosphere like snow

84
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:17,268
.  carbon dioxide ice
and accelerate it into orbit.

85
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:25,338
We can reduce the atmospheric pressure even further by removing excess nitrogen in the same way. In a

86
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:30,250
few decades or centuries, Venus will be covered by a beautiful shallow frozen ocean hundreds of meters deep.

87
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:35,728
This will look the same as it does now.  Very different.

88
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:41,258
Several continents and countless islands have been formed.  This is starting to look a bit like our planet!

89
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:46,001
Now the last and most magnificent stage of terraforming begins:

90
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:49,198
making the air breathable, and adding life

91
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,398
First we need light, we need to heat the planet again.

92
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:02,037
A Venus day has 2802 hours, which is longer than 116 Earth days
so if we just remove our giant mirrors it

93
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,109
will bake half of the planet and
even without the thick air the temperature will still rise to unbearable levels

94
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,328
one of the easiest  The way to create a day and night cycle and let the energy in again

95
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:18,628
is to illuminate our continents and melt our oceans with another set of mirrors.

96
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,508
This will give us complete control over the energy we get and where it goes.

97
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:29,148
The atmosphere is now mostly composed of nitrogen, with essentially no oxygen.

98
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:35,178
The original inhabitants may have been trillions of blue-green algae
that photosynthesized and released oxygen.

99
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:40,307
We know that can rapidly change our atmosphere

100
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:44,888
because billions of years ago, they may have transformed the toxic atmosphere of our young Earth

101
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:50,398
into an oxygen-rich atmosphere for more sophisticated animals.

102
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,798
But more than that, blue-green algae fix nitrogen, taking nitrogen from the atmosphere and

103
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,428
turning it into nutrients for life to use.
In this way, they will essentially nourish our dead seawater

104
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:04,908
and prepare it for more complex organisms

105
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:10,178
On the ground, our colonists need to grind up some of the former surface of Venus

106
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:15,749
to provide soil for nitrogen-fixing plants to grow.
Eventually, billions of trees will spread out to

107
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,908
form vast forests that cover most of the continent.  And Venus will turn green

108
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:25,859
first with oceans, then land. To speed up the process, CO2
is strategically released

109
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,168
to supply plants and blue-green algae.
Areas already covered by plants can be removed from our  Get extra light in orbital mirrors

110
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:35,808
so plants are active most of the day.

111
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:40,470
Perhaps, it doesn't have to be done with the same plants and animals we know today.

112
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:45,878
As genetic engineering matures and our understanding of genetics and the mechanics of life expands,

113
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,288
we may only engineer life when we need it.

114
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,619
All in all, it will take thousands of years to have an atmosphere that humans can breathe.

115
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,719
At the same time, you can roam freely with only your daily clothes and an oxygen mask. The

116
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,398
settlers will enjoy this vast new planet, full of resources and basking in the sun, and

117
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,808
they may come up with new ways to use the

118
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:15,038
vast amount of  CO2 Ice and Nitrogen.
Industrial processes, rocket fuel,

119
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,388
and even facilitate the terraforming of other planets, like the little

120
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:27,018
Mars Venus has fully terraformed
animals roaming vast ecosystems.  Cities are undergoing major construction.

121
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:31,339
Billions of settlers and their descendants call this world their home.

122
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,219
They see images of the past.  How Venus was the least friendly planet in the past.

123
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,008
How it took hundreds of years to freeze this hell and sail on the sea
and how it took thousands of years to

124
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:47,349
let people breathe freely.
They would be very unbelievable.

125
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,949
Ok. Maybe terraforming Venus is not that easy, and there are a lot of things that

126
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,349
have to be done right in the future to make it a reality
but it is possible and the technology is in the

127
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,658
hands of a slightly advanced human who wants to venture into space  achievable.

128
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,378
The only thing that limits us is our imagination,

129
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:12,839
which is at least an easy problem to overcome.

130
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,209
If you think about it, imagination is the only thing holding you back from doing everything and all

131
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,479
you need is a little nudge

132
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,778
and we just did the right thing to get you started
