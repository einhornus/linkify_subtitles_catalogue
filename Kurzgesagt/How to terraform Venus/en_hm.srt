1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:06,800
Leaving earth to find new homes in space is
an old dream of humanity and will sooner or

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,259
later be necessary for our survival. The planet
that gets the most attention is Mars, a small,

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,530
toxic and energy poor planet that just about
seems good enough for a colony of depressed

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,539
humans huddled in underground cities.

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,630
But what if we think bigger? What if we take
Venus, one of the most hostile and deadly

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,759
places in the solar system and turn IT into
a colony? Not by building lofty cloud cities,

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:47,480
but by creating a proper second earth? It
might be easier than you think.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,580
Venus is by far the hottest planet in the
solar system with a surface temperature of

9
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:59,030
460°C, hot enough to melt lead. This heat
is due to the most extreme greenhouse effect

10
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:07,390
in the solar system. CO2 is great at trapping
heat – even a rise from 0.03% to 0.04% in

11
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,700
Earth's atmosphere is heating up our planet
right now. Venus's atmosphere is 97% CO2.

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,060
Also, Venus's atmosphere is 93 times denser
than earth’s. Standing on Venus’ surface

13
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,100
would feel like taking a dive about 900 meters
deep into the ocean. The pressure would kill

14
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,100
you instantly.

15
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,190
It’s a truly horrible place! So why should
we even bother?

16
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:38,340
First and foremost, Venus is almost as big
as Earth and has 90% of its surface gravity.

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,470
Surface gravity is a big problem when colonizing
the solar system because it is very likely

18
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,000
that long stays in low gravity places will
have negative health effects.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,500
Venus’ size means it could be the second
largest habitat in the solar system. A new

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,190
home for billions of humans and trillions
of animals. With oceans, lush forests and

21
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,840
a beautiful blue sky. A properly terraformed
Venus may be the most pleasant place to live

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,310
outside of Earth.

23
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,090
While we can’t exactly terraform Venus today,
a slightly more ambitious future version of

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,310
us COULD take this project on. It will take
a few generations to complete and be a huge

25
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,109
challenge – like building the great pyramids
was for our ancestors. But then it’s not

26
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:25,239
like humans have never started projects that
took more than a lifetime to complete.

27
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,180
Ok! Let’s do it!

28
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,590
Before anything else, we need to cool Venus
down and remove the gas that makes up the

29
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,659
extremely heavy atmosphere. As mentioned,
there is a lot of it. Around 465 million billion

30
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,659
tons.

31
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:46,250
How do we do that? There are a few options.
We could create giant solar collectors powering

32
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,510
a huge array of laser beams, that heat up
the atmosphere so much that it is blasted

33
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,730
into space. Although we would need thousands
of times the entire power generating capacity

34
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,319
of humanity and it would still take thousands
of years to remove the atmosphere.

35
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,310
Another way is to sequester the atmosphere.
Binding the CO2 in different compounds through

36
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,870
chemical reactions. We could mine elements
like Calcium or Magnesium on Mercury and shoot

37
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,900
them at Venus via mass driver systems – Electric
rails that make rockets unnecessary on smaller

38
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,829
planets. The metals would combine to bind
the CO2 into different carbonates basically

39
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,389
forever. But the scale makes the whole thing
impractical. We would need several hundred

40
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:35,290
billion tons of material to sequester the
CO2 this way. Seems like a waste of material

41
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,749
and might take too long.

42
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:44,180
An equally ridiculous idea that could actually
work is to put Venus in the shade. Literally.

43
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,730
By constructing a huge mirror to blot out
the sun to just freeze the atmosphere. The

44
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,349
mirror does not need to be complex or massive,
just a very thin foil with a little structural

45
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:59,260
support. Building such a large flat surface
so close to the sun will turn it effectively

46
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,640
into a solar sail and push it out of position,
so instead of one giant circular object, our

47
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,919
mirror will consist of many different pieces.

48
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,989
Annular slats of angled mirrors can reflect
sunlight from one set of mirrors to the next.

49
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,489
Mirrors would be angled, reflecting light
from one to another until the light is redirected

50
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,448
to the back - balancing the force on the front
and holding them in position.

51
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:27,990
After a few years of getting the infrastructure
in place, things start slowly and then escalate.

52
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,340
For the first few decades, the atmosphere
slowly cools down but stays dense and deadly.

53
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,259
Until, after some 60 years it reaches the
critical temperature of 31° Celsius. Suddenly,

54
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,759
the Great Flood begins on Venus, as CO2 turns
to liquid at this pressure and begins to rain

55
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,960
down- a constant global rainstorm of unbelievable
proportions lasting 30 years. The pressure

56
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,680
and temperature suddenly begin to drop in
unison. For almost a century, puddles turn

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,630
into lakes and oceans.

58
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,270
The surface temperature is now -56° Celsius
and the pressure has dropped to only seven

59
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,120
times the pressure on earth. Finally, at a
really unpleasant -81°, the CO2 oceans begin

60
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,770
to freeze and the rain turns into snow. This
leaves us with a frozen Venus covered in oceans

61
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:26,160
as hard as rock and gigantic CO2 glaciers.
What remains of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen,

62
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,280
at about 3 times earth’s surface pressure.
If you don’t mind freezing and suffocating,

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,389
you can now take a stroll over Venus' surface.

64
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,540
But the frozen CO2 remains a bit of a problem.
At some point we want to warm up the planet,

65
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,820
but if we do, the CO2 ice will melt and fill
up the atmosphere again.

66
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,889
So we need some way to keep it from doing
that.

67
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,409
One is to simply cover it all with cheap plastic
insulation and cover it up with ground-up

68
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:56,130
venus rock or water oceans. Although some
planetary scientists will be very stressed

69
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:02,430
out about us building a new planet containing
a potential timebomb like that. A few unfortunately

70
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,729
timed volcanoes could melt a lot of CO2 at
once and ruin everything.

71
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:11,830
Another obvious solution is to shoot it all
out into space and collect it into a small

72
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,719
moon for storage and future use. We can make
this more efficient by using mass drivers

73
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:21,379
instead of rockets, but moving all that mass
will still be a pretty intense challenge that

74
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,129
will take some time to solve.

75
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:27,650
Whatever we end up doing with the atmosphere,
to move forward we need water, which we could

76
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:34,250
get from Ice-Moons. Europa, a moon of Jupiter,
has twice as much water as Earth’s oceans.

77
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,020
Now catching a moon and transporting it through
the solar system is not exactly easy.

78
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,270
So instead it might be easier to cut chunks
of ice off Europa with an army of construction

79
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,070
drones and shoot them at Venus using more
of those mass drivers. Space tethers could

80
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:55,080
save us a lot of effort and energy here – we
made a whole video explaining how they work,

81
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,129
but in a nutshell, they are slings that can
take a payload on both ends.

82
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,879
On Europa, they do most of the work needed
to catapult our ice to Venus. The ice hits

83
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:12,210
the Venus tethers, which gently drop it into
the atmosphere, where it falls down as snow.

84
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,270
In exchange, the Venus tethers get to catch
CO2 ice shot up from below and accelerate

85
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,729
it into orbit.
We can remove excess nitrogen using this same

86
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,340
method to further lower our atmospheric pressure.

87
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,099
After a few decades or centuries, Venus would
be covered by a nice, shallow frozen ocean

88
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,949
a few hundred meters deep. It would look extremely
different from today. A few continents and

89
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:41,259
countless islands have formed. This is beginning
to look a bit like our planet!

90
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:46,289
Now the last and most magnificent phase of
terraforming begins: Making the atmosphere

91
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,199
breathable and adding life.

92
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,400
First we need light though and we need to
heat the planet up again. A Venus day is 2802

93
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,039
hours long. More than 116 Earth days. So if
we just remove our giant mirror, we would

94
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,110
grill half of our planet. Even without the
massive atmosphere, temperatures would reach

95
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,330
unbearable levels. The simplest way to create
a day/night cycle and let some energy in again,

96
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,629
is with another set of mirrors to illuminate
our continents and melt our water oceans.

97
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,509
Which would let us completely control how
much energy we get and where it goes.

98
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:29,150
The atmosphere is now mostly made up of nitrogen
and basically devoid of oxygen. So the first

99
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:35,150
inhabitants will likely be trillions and trillions
of Cyanobacteria, which can get photosynthesising

100
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,310
and release oxygen. We know that they can
quickly turn around the atmosphere of a planet

101
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:44,889
because billions of years ago, they were probably
responsible for turning the toxic atmosphere

102
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,400
of our young Earth into an atmosphere with
enough oxygen for more complex animal life.

103
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,800
But not only that – Cyanobacteria can fix
Nitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into

104
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,430
nutrients that can be used by living beings.
This way they will essentially fertilize our

105
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,910
dead ocean water and prepare it for more complex
organisms.

106
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,180
On land, our colonists need to grind down
some of the former venusian surface to make

107
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,750
soil for nitrogen fixing plants to grow on.
Eventually billions of trees would spread

108
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,910
creating large forests, covering massive parts
of the continents. Venus would turn green.

109
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,860
First the oceans, then the land. To speed
things up, CO2 would be strategically released

110
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,170
to supply the plants and cyanobacteria. Areas
already covered with plants could get extra

111
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,810
daylight from our orbital mirrors, so the
plants would be active for most of each day.

112
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,471
Maybe, we won’t have to do this with the
same plants and animals we know today. As

113
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:45,880
genetic engineering matures and our understanding
of genetics and the machinery of life expands,

114
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,290
we might just engineer life as we need it.

115
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,620
All in all, it would take several thousand
years to make the atmosphere breathable by

116
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,720
humans. In the meantime, you could stroll
around with nothing more than regular clothes

117
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,380
and an oxygen mask. Settlers would enjoy a
vast new planet, filled with resources and

118
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,810
bathed in sunlight. They might think of new
ways to use the vast amounts of carbon dioxide

119
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:15,040
ice and nitrogen orbiting in space above.
Industrial processes, rocket fuel or even

120
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,390
boosting the terraforming of another planet,
like tiny Mars

121
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:27,020
Venus is fully terraformed. Animals roam through
vast ecosystems. Cities are being constructed.

122
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,340
Billions of settlers and their descendants
make this world their home. They will see

123
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,220
images of the past. How Venus was once the
most hostile planet around. How it took hundreds

124
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,010
of years to freeze hell and to ship in the
oceans and another few thousand years to make

125
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,350
it possible to breathe freely. They will barely
be able to believe it.

126
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,950
Ok. Maybe it is not that easy to terraform
Venus and a lot of things must go right for

127
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,350
this future to become reality. But it is possible
and with technology that is within the reach

128
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,660
of a motivated and slightly more advanced
humanity that wants to venture into space.

129
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,380
The only thing that is stopping it is our
imagination. And that at least is a problem

130
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,840
that’s easy to overcome.

131
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,210
If you think about it, your imagination is
the only thing stopping you from doing all

132
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,480
kinds of things. All you need is a little
nudge – and we might just have the right

133
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,780
thing to get you started.

134
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,280

explains her four-phase process for exploring
and figuring out your direction as an artist.

147
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,190
For us, it was a great way to get into the
flow of creating something.

148
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,080
But anything that makes you feel excited and
sparks new ideas is a great first step.
