1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,040
Wrapping your mind around your life is pretty
hard, because you are up to your neck in it.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,510
It's like trying to understand the ocean while
learning how to swim. On most days you are

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,980
busy just keeping your head above water. So
it is not easy to figure out what to do with

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,080
your life and how to spend your time.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,970
There are a million distractions. Your family,
friends and romantic partners, boring work,

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,460
and exciting projects. Video games to play
and books to read. And then there is your

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:37,140
couch that somebody needs to lie on. It’s
easy to get lost. So let us take a step back

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:49,540
and take a look at your life from the outside.

9
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,210
The average Kurzgesagt viewer is around 25
years old. Which is a pretty good time in

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,950
the life of most people: The insecurities
of the teenage years have begun to recede.

11
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,170
Maybe you find yourself in a job or a long
term relationship. Maybe you’ve started

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,770
a family, or are working on an advanced degree.
Maybe you are not doing any of that and still

13
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,369
want to enjoy life, whatever that means to
you. Or maybe you feel stuck and don’t know

14
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,540
where to go yet.

15
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,921
About one in twenty people watching this video
will get to live to 100. Let’s assume you

16
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:27,860
are one of the lucky ones, which means you
had a total of 5200 weeks of life at your

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,860
disposal when you were born.

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,410
You spent the first 600 weeks of your life
being a kid and 400 being a teenager. During

19
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,500
this time you were pretty useless for society
and also not very free to make your own decisions.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,830
As a payoff, you were somewhat spared from
the consequences and responsibilities of adulthood.

21
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,670
Mostly because well meaning adults protected
you by cleaning up your mess and giving you

22
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,180
time to find yourself. This time is necessary
to make you, at least in theory, a functioning

23
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,280
human. Although most people probably don’t
feel like that after puberty. In any case,

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,280
by the time you are 20, over 1000 of your
5200 weeks have passed.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,049
Depending on what you aspire to, at this point
you are either working already or have entered

26
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:17,739
further education. The amount of fun you can
have in this phase of your life varies a lot.

27
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,809
If you pick up a trade or need to work to
support yourself or others, the serious side

28
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:27,419
of life begins earlier, if you go to university
you get to push back work life a bit longer.

29
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,250
In any case, most people start working for
real in their twenties at the latest. Which

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,251
begins the productive or potentially grindy
or soul crushing period of your life. People

31
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:43,700
tend to work until the age of 65. Which means
that you’ll spend at least 2000 weeks of

32
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,620
your life, with serious adult work – hopefully
in a job that makes you feel good and appreciated

33
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,900
or that makes the world better. This is such
an important thing that we’ll look at work

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,079
and how you can try to find a satisfying career
in another video!

35
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,409
This is the main block of life for most people
– The time when you might have kids and

36
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:10,349
travel a bit and climb the career ladder and
build a house, may get divorced and fall in

37
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,139
love again. In this phase you transition from
being young to middle aged to old – not

38
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:24,629
old, old but the “young old” of your sixties.
At 65 you have used up 3400 of your 5200 weeks.

39
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:30,469
The last phase of your life begins. If you’ve
managed to acquire enough wealth to retire,

40
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:36,819
in theory you are now free to do whatever
you like, for up to 1800 weeks. But of course,

41
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:41,790
this is not how it works for the majority
of you watching this video. 19 out of 20 people

42
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,150
will not live to one hundred. The average
lifespan in the US is 79. In Germany it is

43
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,150
81. In Japan 84. In Brazil it is 75.

44
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,919
If you die at age 80, which is still not bad,
you only have 780 weeks of freedom after you

45
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,589
retire. That’s roughly as many weeks of
freedom as an old person as you spent as a

46
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:10,529
child. Unfortunately disease and the tiredness
of age trip you up here, because with old

47
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:16,199
age the human body begins to decline sharply.
For example the vast majority of cancer related

48
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,949
deaths occur in people over 70. If you bet
all your fun cards on being free and happy

49
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,650
in your retirement you might be bitterly disappointed.

50
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,370
And all of this is still assuming things work
out and you even get to grow old. You can

51
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:39,650
drown in a pool at age 7, get cancer at age
32, die in a car crash at age 48. You can

52
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,270
fall from a ladder at age 60. Every day the
universe rolls a bunch of dice for every human

53
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,460
– and everyday, someone somewhere on this
planet, rolls a critical failure and their

54
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,680
life ends that day. The older you get, the
more dice are rolled for you.

55
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,569
Usually when you swim through the ocean that
is your life, you do not think about all of

56
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:06,969
this too much and that is fine. Life is engaging
enough by itself and the future is this undefined

57
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:12,849
weird thing. But thinking about it from time
to time is helpful in refocusing on what you

58
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:18,729
want to do and to minimize regrets you will
have when you look back. And to remind you

59
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:24,009
that if you don’t use your time today, you
might not get a chance to use it tomorrow.

60
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,180
Life is complicated and it is hard to make
decisions between all the things and people

61
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,650
that are important to you.

62
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,889
This has become painfully obvious to billions
of people during the Coronavirus pandemic.

63
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,470
If you respected social distancing, so many
things that we took for granted were not available

64
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,680
anymore. Traveling and public places and eating
out and seeing friends and meeting new people.

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,190
Spending time together became limited and
precious. But actually, the time you have

66
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,919
with the people you love is already precious.

67
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,250
Think of your parents. As a child you spend
basically every day with them. Your time spent

68
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,370
together begins to decline as you transition
and become a teenager and fight to develop

69
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,150
your own identity. But as teenagers you probably
still see them regularly, which changes as

70
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,300
you enter your twenties, when most people
move out. For university, for work or just

71
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,160
to be on their own.

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,759
If you are making an effort to be with your
parents for two full weeks each year for the

73
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,759
rest of their lives, which covers the main
holidays, birthdays and a bit extra you still

74
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,480
have already spent more than 90% of the time
you will ever spend with them, even if they

75
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,710
grow pretty old. If they die earlier or if
you see them only a few days each year this

76
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,430
number shrinks even more. So in all likelihood,
the vast majority of time you will ever spend

77
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,290
with your parents has passed.

78
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,550
The same holds true for your siblings or old
friends that moved to the other side of the

79
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,830
country. You are at the tail end of the time
with some of the most important people in

80
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,400
your life. One day you will see them for the
last time. And it is actually the same with

81
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,099
everything else. The concept of doing something
for the last time feels eerie, like something

82
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,930
that you should only experience when you are
on death row or extremely old or something

83
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,389
like that. But it happens all the time.

84
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,740
Is there a hobby you have been lazy about
for a long time? Maybe you still have those

85
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,249
Warhammer minis that you wanted to paint?
Did you always want to revisit that place

86
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:26,919
where you had an amazing time a decade ago?
Is there someone you wanted to reach out to

87
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:33,270
for a long time but haven’t yet? Or pick
up that sport again to meet new friends? Maybe

88
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,499
you will never do any of these things again,
because life gets in the way and at some point

89
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,710
it is too late.

90
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,330
As the global Pandemic begins to wind down,
we will all soon be able to be with each other

91
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,359
again and do fun things together.

92
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,460
It is never a bad time to reach out to a friend,
or a potential friend and let them know that

93
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,789
you are looking forward to hanging out.

94
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,330
But no matter when you are watching this:
our life is an incredible gift and there are

95
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:05,530
so many fun, engaging and fulfilling things
to do. And you get to decide what and who

96
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,759
matters to you. But what matters the most
is that you actually make decisions from time

97
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,129
to time.

98
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:22,240
This video was based on and inspired by an
article by our friend Tim Urban of Wait but

99
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,009
Why, the best blog on the internet. Be sure
to check it out to get more new perspectives

100
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,240
on things.

101
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,279
Also, if you want a reminder about the things
we still want to do in life, with Tims permission

102
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,550
we created a kurzgesagt version of the “Calendar
of Your Life” that lets you track how many

103
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:43,299
weeks of your life you have spent already
and how many you have left. You can also color

104
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,309
in the weeks to keep track of exactly how
you are spending them. If you are just looking

105
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,800
for a visual reminder to put things in perspective,
we’ve made a “Timeline of your Life”.

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,571
It is printed in vibrant neon colors on high
quality paper and will look great as an art

107
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,470
piece on your wall.

108
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,160
Like all of our products, these posters were
designed with love and produced with care

109
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,199
by us here at kurzgesagt. Getting something
from our shop is the best way to support our

110
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:15,540
channel while getting something beautiful
in return. Because of you we can keep making

111
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,800
elaborate videos like the one you just watched,
and release them for free, for everyone. Thank

112
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,630
you so much for your support!
