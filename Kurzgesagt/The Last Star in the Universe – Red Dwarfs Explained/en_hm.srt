1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,679
One day the last star will die and the universe will turn dark forever.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,579
It will probably be a red dwarf; a tiny kind of star.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:18,299
That's also one of our best bets to find alien life, and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:32,039
So, what do we know about them, and why are they our last hope?

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,759
At least 70% of stars in the universe are red dwarfs.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,299
They are the tiniest stars out there, with only about 7 to 50% of the mass of our sun.

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,879
Not that much bigger than our planet Jupiter, which is still huge though.

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,399
They are also very dim.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,939
It is impossible to see them with the naked eye.

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,059
You have never seen one in the night sky.

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,019
Even with all our technology, we can only clearly observe red dwarfs in our neighborhood.

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,119
Approximately 20 of the 30 stars close to earth are red dwarfs.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,719
Like all stars, red dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,839
But while more massive stars accumulate all the fused helium in their cores,

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,199
red dwarfs stay convective, meaning that the  helium and hydrogen constantly mix.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,199
So they use up their fuel incredibly slowly, before they are extinguished.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,119
Red dwarfs burn so slowly, that their average lifespan is between 1 and 10 trillion years

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,259
by comparison, the Sun will survive for another 5 billion years

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,779
Because the universe is only 13.75 billion years old

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,379
not a single red dwarf has reached the later development stages

21
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,039
Every single one of the trillions that exist is still a baby.

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,719
Speaking of babies, the smallest star in the entire

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,779
universe is also a red dwarf because small red dwarfs
are right on the verge of being a star at all.

24
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,459
Just a tiny bit less hydrogen and
they are mere brown dwarfs: failed stars

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,599
that cannot sustain a fusion reaction
for long.

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,979
So what about aliens or a new home for Humanity?

27
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,549
Since our Sun will die one day, we'll eventually need to look for

28
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,179
a new home and where there are habitable
planets, there might also be aliens.

29
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,539
The Kepler space observatory found that at
least half of all red dwarfs host rock

30
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,639
planets between half and four times the
mass of our Earth.

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,499
Many of them are in the habitable zone -- the area around a star where water can be liquid --

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,629
but since red dwarfs burn at relatively
cold temperatures, a planet would need to

33
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,729
be really close to be hospitable,
probably as close as Mercury to our Sun

34
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:43,129
or even closer, which brings with it all
kinds of problems. For example, a planet

35
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,839
this close to a star would probably be
tidaly locked, meaning the same side

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,219
would always face it. This side would be
incredibly hot while the shadow side

37
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,579
would be frozen, which makes it hard for
life to develop.

38
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:03,139
Although a planet with a big enough ocean might be able to distribute the star's energy and create some kind of stability.

39
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,859
All the gravitation forces of a Red Dwarf could squeeze the planet and heat it up so much

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,699
that it might loose all its water over time.

41
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,359
These planets could end up like Venus, a hot burning hell.

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,339
Another problem is that, many Red Dwarfs vary in their energy output

43
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,179
They could be covered in star spots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% for months

44
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,999
Wich would cause oceans on planets to freeze over.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,039
At other times, they can emit powerful solar flares; sudden outbursts of energy incredibly powerful.

46
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,639
These Red Dwarfs could double their brightness in minutes

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,279
Wich could strip away sizable portions of a planet's atmosphere and burn it, rendering its

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,199
On the other hand, their extremely long life span is a big plus.

49
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,759
A Red Dwarf with just moderate levels of activity, could be an amazing place for a planet that hosts life.

50
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,819
Life on Earth has existed for about 4 Billion years

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,699
And, we have about a Billion years left before the sun becomes so hot, that complex life on Earth

52
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,179
will become impossible.

53
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,239
We will either die out or leave Earth and look for a new home.

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,239
We could build a civilization for potentially trillions of years, around a Red Dwarf with the right conditions.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,278
About 5% of the Red Dwarf in the Milky Way, may host habitable, roughly Earth sized planets.

56
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,838
That would be more than 4 Billion in total.

57
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,659
But, life may not even need a planet like Earth.

58
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,819
Candidates for life around a Red Dwarf may be the moons of Gas Giants, also called Super Earths

59
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,339
Really massive rocky planets.

60
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,199
All alone, there are an estimated 60 Billion potentially habitable planets around Red Dwarfs.

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,259
And, that's in the Milky Way alone.

62
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,259
So, Red Dwarfs might become really important for our survival in the future

63
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,479
But, everything has to die at some point, even Red Dwarfs.

64
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:56,079
When in Trillions of years, the life of the last Red Dwarf is about to end, it will not be a very spectacular event.

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,039
As its hydrogen runs out, it shrinks, becoming a Blue Dwarf, burning out completely.

66
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,379
After its fuel is spent, it's transformed into a White Dwarf, an object about as small as Earth

67
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,919
Packed very densely and made of degenerate gasses, mostly of Helium-4 nuclei.

68
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,819
Having no more source of energy, it will cool extremely slowly over trillions of years.

69
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,959
Until it becomes its final form: A cold Black Dwarf.

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,999
White and Black Dwarfs are so fascinating, that they deserve their own video.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,239
Anyway.. It's going to be a long time before the last in the Universe vanish

72
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,559
It's kind of uplifting to know that, if humanity succeeds in venturing into Space

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,899
We have plenty of time, before the Universe turns out the lights.
