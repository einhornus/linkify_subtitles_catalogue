1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,379
Neutron stars are the densest things that are not black holes.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,339
In their cores, we might find the most dangerous substance in existence:

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,839
Strange matter.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,319
A bizarre thing so extreme,

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,419
that it bends the rules of the universe

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,859
and could infect and destroy everything it comes into contact with--

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,559
--or it could teach us about how the universe began.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,899
Maybe both.

[Intro music]

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,779
To understand how extreme strange matter really is, we first need to get a few basics.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,259
What is a neutron star, and how does strange matter break the rules of the universe?

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,459
To get all of this into one video, we'll grossly oversimplify a few things,

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,259
but we'll provide you with further reading if you want more details.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,079
A neutron star is what remains after a very massive star explodes in a supernova.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,039
When this happens, the star's core collapses under its own gravity

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,939
with such a strong inward force that it squeezes nuclei and particles together violently.

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,819
Electrons are pushed into protons, so they merge and turn into neutrons.

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,919
All the "nothing" inside of atoms is suddenly completely filled with particles

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,719
that really don't want to be close to each other, but have no choice.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,719
They desperately push back against gravity, against the collapse.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,859
If gravity wins, they will become a black hole.

22
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,219
If they win, they become a neutron star.

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,899
This makes neutron stars like giant atomic nuclei the size of a city,

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,259
but holding the mass of our Sun.

25
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,779
And here, things get weird.

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,079
The environment in the core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of nuclear physics change.

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,979
And this could lead to a strange and extremely dangerous substance.

28
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,599
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,019
We first need to know the rules before we learn how they can be broken.

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,419
Protons and neutrons, the particles making up the nuclei of atoms,

31
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,019
are made up of smaller particles called quarks.

32
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,299
Quarks really don't want to be alone.

33
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,999
They are what we call confined.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,659
You can try to separate them,

35
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,859
but the harder you pull, the harder they try to pull themselves back together.

36
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,739
If you use a lot of energy, they just use this energy to create new quarks.

37
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,519
Quarks only exist together as the building blocks of other particles

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,439
and have never been observed by themselves.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,339
They come in many types, but only two appear to make stable matter:

40
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,619
the 'up' and 'down' quarks found in protons and neutrons.

41
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,659
All other quarks seem to decay away quickly,

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,119
but this may be different inside neutron stars.

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,699
The forces operating in their cores are so extreme

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,499
that they are actually similar to the universe shortly after the Big Bang.

45
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,539
Neutron star cores are like fossils, which can let us peer back in time to the beginning of everything.

46
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,759
So learning how quarks behave inside a neutron star

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,299
is a way of understanding the very nature of the universe itself.

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,639
One hypothesis is that, inside a neutron star core, protons and neutrons deconfine.

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,959
All the particles crammed shoulder-to-shoulder dissolve and melt into a sort of bath of quarks.

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,739
Uncountable numbers of particles become one giant thing made purely from quarks:

51
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,559
Quark matter.

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,399
A star made from this is called a Quark Star.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,619
Though from the outside, it may not look any different than a regular neutron star.

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,119
Now, we can finally talk about the most dangerous substance.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,119
If the pressure inside a quark star is great enough, it may get stranger,

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,059
literally.

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,559
In the cores of neutron stars, some of the quarks may be converted into 'strange' quarks.

58
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,339
Strange quarks have bizarre nuclear properties,

59
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,759
and they are heavier, and for the lack of a better word, stronger.

60
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,139
If they turn up, they could create strange matter.

61
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,439
Strange matter might be the ideal state of matter,

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,219
perfectly dense, perfectly stable, indestructible,

63
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,459
more stable than any other matter in the universe.

64
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,999
So stable that it can exist outside neutron stars.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,778
If this is the case, we have a problem.

66
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,679
It might be infectious.

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,699
Every piece of matter it touches might be so impressed by its stability

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,559
that it would immediately turn into strange matter, too.

69
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,739
Protons and neutrons would dissolve and become part of the quark bath,

70
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,839
which frees energy and creates more strange matter.

71
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,879
The only way to get rid of it would be to throw it into a black hole.

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,019
But then again, who cares?

73
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,579
All of it is inside neutron stars,

74
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,199
except when neutron stars collide with other neutron stars or black holes.

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,059
They spew out tremendous amounts of their insides,

76
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,159
some of which could include little droplets of strange matter called strangelets.

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,059
Strangelets are as dense as the core of a neutron star.

78
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,199
They could be really small, maybe even subatomic,

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,279
but even the largest strangelets wouldn't be any bigger than a rocket.

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,279
These strangelets would drift through the galaxy for millions or billions of years

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,579
until they meet a star or planet by chance.

82
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,919
If one were to strike earth, it would immediately start converting it into strange matter.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,659
The more it converts, the more it would grow.

84
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,699
Ultimately, all of the atoms making up earth would be converted.

85
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,799
Earth would become a hot clump of strange matter, the size of an asteroid.

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,219
If a strangelet strikes the sun, it would collapse into a strange star,

87
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,539
eating through it like fire through a dry forest.

88
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,959
This would not change the Sun's mass much,

89
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,819
but it would become way less bright.

90
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,039
So Earth would freeze to death.

91
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,759
And like a tiny virus, we'd have no way to see a strangelet coming.

92
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,099
Worse still, some theories suggest strangelets are more than common,

93
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,239
outnumbering all stars in the galaxy.

94
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,399
The strangelets could've formed very early after the Big Bang,

95
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,579
when it was as hot and dense as a neutron star core everywhere.

96
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,359
They might be clumping around the gravity of galaxies

97
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,679
as the universe expanded and evolved.

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,799
Strangelets could even be so numerous and massive,

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,519
that they might actually be the dark matter we suspect holds galaxies together.

100
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,919
But then again, maybe not.

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,279
This is speculation.

102
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,899
And the Earth and Sun and planets haven't been consumed

103
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,979
in a wildfire of strangelets in the past few billion years.

104
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,899
So the odds seem good that it won't happen any time soon.

105
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,399
Understanding these strange objects today

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,279
may be the key to understanding the birth of our universe,

107
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,659
and why it grew to look the way it does now.

108
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,759
When scientists first started playing with magnets and wires and thinking about electrons,

109
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,319
they had no idea how technology would evolve in the next hundred years.

110
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,679
The scientists thinking about the cause of neutron stars and strange matter today

111
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,859
may be setting up humans for a future beyond our wildest imaginations

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,259
...or maybe not.

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,839
Time will tell...

114
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,079
So, while you're waiting to see if the universe gets destroyed,

115
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,959
you might still want to find out more about it.
