1
00:00:01,275 --> 00:00:03,677
Being a citizen 
of the European Union

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:05,959
means that many aspects 
of our lives

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,049
are regulated 
by a weird entity.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,853
It feels like a huge bureaucracy
is making decisions over our heads.

5
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:15,619
Many Europeans think

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,024
that their vote 
in the EU elections doesn't count,

7
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,161
and that the EU 
is not democratic.

8
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:23,763
How democratic 
is the EU really?

9
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:27,133
And, does your vote 
actually achieve anything?

10
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:28,599
In democratic states,

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,604
public policies are based 
on the will of the people.

12
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:32,919
But, the people

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,908
are not a coherent thing.

14
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,111
Countless different groups
are battling for influence and power

15
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:41,281
to establish laws 
and rules that benefit them.

16
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:42,749
In a working democracy,

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,539
there are checks 
and balances

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,486
that are supposed 
to create a fair environment

19
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:49,356
where these battles 
can be fought.

20
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:53,159
Term limits stop factions 
from dominating too much.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,296
But all of this ends 
at our borders.

22
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:59,139
International politics 
are not democratic,

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,967
but anarchic.

24
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:05,505
No central authority is powerful enough
to ensure fairness, or enforce laws,

25
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:10,543
so the only law is the tyranny
of the strongest, and anarchy.

26
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:12,359
So for most of human history,

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,848
powerful countries
took what they wanted from others

28
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,219
either by extortion

29
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,351
or by violence.

30
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:19,819
After World War Two,

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,889
the United Nations
were founded to overcome this anarchy

32
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,226
by establishing rules 
on how countries should behave.

33
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:28,939
But since the UN has 
virtually no power,

34
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,398
and its members 
often have opposing interests,

35
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:34,067
it's usually politely ignored.

36
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:38,071
The EU is a construct that tries
to have rules and laws for its member nations

37
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:39,859
that are actually enforceable,

38
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,344
as the European Court
of Justice is able to make binding decisions.

39
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:45,299
Originally,

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,219
the EU was founded
to ensure peace

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,581
between European nations

42
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:50,917
and prosperity 
for the continent.

43
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:54,888
But it's also an attempt
to gain international power for its members.

44
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,723
It's like a super state

45
00:01:56,724 --> 00:02:01,461
and it's striving to be democratic
and legitimized by all of its citizens.

46
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:02,439
To do that,

47
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,499
it has to solve the problem of
different actors wanting different things.

48
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,637
Only, that its members
are countries with very different priorities.

49
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:11,379
So,

50
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,106
how does this work?

51
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,842
Since the EU 
is ridiculously complex,

52
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:19,245
and politicians are even worse 
than scientists at naming things,

53
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:20,999
we'll simplify massively

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,949
and omit 
a lot of details.

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,487
You can find further reading
and explanations in our Sources Document.

56
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:28,459
OK,

57
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,879
if you want to create
a democratic union

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,125
of independent nations,

59
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:32,125
you have two options.

60
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:33,927
you have two options.

61
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:34,839
One:

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,699
Let everybody vote 
for national politicians

63
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,033
who then make decisions 
for the Union together.

64
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:40,759
Or,

65
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,601
two:

66
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:43,779
Let every citizen vote directly

67
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,619
for an independent
institution

68
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,141
that's able to make 
binding decisions.

69
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:50,610
Both approaches have 
their upsides and downsides,

70
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:53,847
and the EU ended up 
with a mix of both of them.

71
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:55,899
Next to the European 
Court of Justice,

72
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,452
there are four main institutions 
that we'll talk about today.

73
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:00,920
The European Council,

74
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:04,757
which is made up of the heads of government
or states of the member countries.

75
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,392
The Council of the EU,

76
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:08,928
with ministers 
from the member countries.

77
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:11,297
The third one is 
the European Commission,

78
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,679
which is the de facto 
government of the EU,

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,236
having one Commissioner 
for each member state.

80
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,399
And, lastly,

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,372
the European Parliament.

82
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,559
The Parliament 
is the only part of the EU

83
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,444
that is directly elected 
by you, dear Citizen,

84
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:26,613
in the European elections.

85
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:32,418
In principle, all of these institutions of the EU
originate from your direct or indirect vote,

86
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,721
be it at the national or EU level.

87
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:36,956
But some 
do more than others.

88
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:37,959
For example,

89
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,926
you vote for 
your national representative

90
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,695
and therefore contribute 
to form a national government

91
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:45,865
whose head of state has a seat 
in the European Council.

92
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:49,869
These leaders choose the president of
the EU Commission and its fellow commissioners,

93
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,072
who eventually are confirmed 
by the EU Parliament.

94
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:56,042
So, this is a sort of 
indirect democracy.

95
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:57,644
You didn't vote for the Commission,

96
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,999
but you voted for the people 
who appointed them

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,916
and for those who confirmed 
and police them.

98
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,299
So, in effect,

99
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,154
2.5 of the 4
main European Union institutions

100
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:10,857
depend on the member state governments.

101
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:15,395
But since you, as a citizen,
can only directly vote for the European Parliament,

102
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:16,679
the question is,

103
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,431
"â€‹How powerful is it?"

104
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:22,235
How much influence 
does your vote have?

105
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:25,338
The European Parliament
started out with very little influence

106
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:29,242
but has become more and more
powerful over the past two decades.

107
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,519
Today, it has 
to approve new laws

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,914
which can be binding 
for the member countries.

109
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:37,619
It also votes on how 
the EU budget is spent

110
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,687
and on international treaties.

111
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:43,099
All of this makes 
the Parliament very powerful

112
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,958
and, thus, your vote 
very influential,

113
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,660
even on an international level.

114
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:52,599
Compared to national parliaments,
one major power is still missing though.

115
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,369
The EU Parliament officially
can't propose new laws on its own

116
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,373
which is often the core of the argument
the EU is not Democratic enough

117
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:04,577
and that the European Parliament
should be given more influence.

118
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:09,349
Right now, the member states' governments
pretty much control the European Union.

119
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,319
Giving the Parliament more power would make
the EU, as a whole, more democratic

120
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,422
but it would also take power 
from member states.

121
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:19,292
It's not clear 
which approach is better.

122
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:25,632
Ultimately it's for the Member States and us as citizens
to decide how the Union should develop.

123
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:29,068
OK, so can we draw 
a conclusion here?

124
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:29,979
As a whole,

125
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,773
the EU is not as democratic 
as most of its member states.

126
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:35,942
But it is democratic.

127
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:37,944
If you don't like decisions they make,

128
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,846
regarding copyright, for example,

129
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:44,284
you can look up what your representatives
voted for and vote them out.

130
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:46,779
The struggle to make it 
more democratic

131
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,323
is closely tied 
to who holds power over what.

132
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,358
The EU keeps changing.

133
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,799
You, dear Citizen,

134
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,862
are not only voting 
on the current politics

135
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:59,259
but also on what the system 
will look like in the future.

136
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,759
There are many parties and politicians
that vow to make the EU Parliament,

137
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,171
and therefore 
your vote, stronger.

138
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:07,259
Many others want 
to keep it as it is,

139
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,608
or even diminish it.

140
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,199
It's for you to decide

141
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,680
what you think
is better for the future of the Union.

142
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:18,051
Currently, it's equally important
for the EU who you vote for at home,

143
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:24,190
because these are the people who have
the most influence in the European Union right now.

144
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:26,159
Opinion

145
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,363
At home is also where the EU 
is often used as a scapegoat.

146
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:31,479
Politicians,

147
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,499
especially 
before national elections,

148
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,835
like to pretend the EU is all-powerful

149
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:39,439
and mix up rules and laws
over the heads of the governments and citizens.

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,277
Although, often, they were
directly responsible for what the EU did.

151
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,179
Democracy is annoying

152
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,559
and complicated,

153
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,115
and often very boring.

154
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:50,619
In the European Union,

155
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,553
even more so 
than in the Member States.

156
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,279
But,

157
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,092
voting and caring about
how our political institutions change and develop

158
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:02,862
is one of the most powerful things 
we can do as citizens.

159
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:08,034
The last few years have shown that
extreme things can happen through elections.

160
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:12,472
We have to decide if we want
to be an active part of this process.

161
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:17,377
If we don't take part in the struggle
for power that is politics, others will.

162
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:21,748
And we might not like 
what they decide for us.

163
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:24,650
Because Europe is 
an important topic for us,

164
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:29,088
we've translated this video
into as many European languages as possible.

165
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,739
A couple of European YouTubers narrated it,

166
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,460
and uploaded it 
to their own channels.

167
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,799
Thank you to Funk

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,730
and all YouTubers who helped us.

169
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:41,233
You can find the playlist
with all language versions in the description.
