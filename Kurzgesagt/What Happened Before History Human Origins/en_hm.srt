1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,719
The world we live in feels normal, ordinary.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,399
It feels like this is just how humans exist and always existed.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,679
But, it's not.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,539
Never before have we humans lived in a world as sophisticated and engineered to our needs as today.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,219
Giving us the luxury to forget about ourselves and not worry about survival.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,739
Food, shelter, security – all of this is, more or less, taken for granted.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:36,659
But we're a special few; for more than 99.99% of human history, life was completely different.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:48,999
And there's no such thing as just one human history.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,619
Our story begins 6 million years ago, when the tribe of hominini split and our relationship with the apes ended.

10
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,199
2.8 million years ago, the genus of homo, the first humans, emerged.

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,699
We like to think about ourselves as the only humans, but this is far from the truth.

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,939
When we, homo sapiens sapiens, came into existence 200,000 years ago, there were at least six other human species around.

13
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:23,939
Cousins of comparable intelligence and ability, which must have been incredibly scary, kind of like living with aliens.

14
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,299
Some of them were very successful.

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,079
Homo erectus, for example, survived for 2 million years.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,239
Ten times longer than modern humans have existed.

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,119
The last of the other humans disappeared around 10,000 years ago.

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,319
We don't know what caused them to die out.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,739
Modern humans have at least a few percent of neanderthal and other human DNA, so there was some mixing,

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,119
but certainly not enough to be a merger between species.

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,719
So we don't know if our cousins went away because they lost the battle over resources, or because of a series of minor genocides.

22
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,279
Either way, only we remain.

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,459
Back to the beginnings of humanity.

24
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,059
2.8 million years ago, early humans used tools, but did not make a lot of progress for nearly 2 million years.

25
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,799
Until they learned to control fire.

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,019
Fire meant cooking, which made food more nutritious, which contributed to the development of our brain.

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,619
It also produced light and warmth, which made days longer and winters less gruesome.

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,479
On top of that, it not only scared predators away, it could also be used for hunting.

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,699
A torched wood or grassland provided small animals, nuts and tubers that were pre-roasted.

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,059
From 300,000 years ago, most of the different human species lived in small hunter-gatherer societies.

31
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,159
They had fire, wood and stone tools, planned for the future, buried their dead, and had cultures of their own.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,359
But most importantly, they spoke to each other.

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,899
Probably in a kind of proto-language, less complex than ours.

34
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,279
If we had a time machine, how far would we be able to go back,

35
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,219
steal a few babies and raise them today without anyone noticing that they're a bit different?

36
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,039
There is much debate.

37
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,999
Anatomically, modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago,

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,299
but probably 70,000 years is as far as we could travel back and still snatch a behaviourally modern human.

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,339
Before that, the babies would probably lack a few crucial gene mutations

40
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,239
Necessary to build a brain with modern language and abstract thinking abilities.

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,439
At some point, around 50,000 years ago, there was an explosion in innovation.

42
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,339
Tools and weapons became more sophisticated and culture became more complex,

43
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,479
because at this point, humans had a multi-purpose brain,

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,559
and a more advanced language to communicate information with each other effectively,

45
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,619
and down to the last detail.

46
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:55,199
This allowed much closer cooperation, and is what really makes us different from any other creature on Earth.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,899
Not our comparatively weak bodies and inferior senses,

48
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,539
but the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups, unlike, for example, rigid beehives

49
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,599
or intimate, but tiny wolf packs.

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,959
As our brain evolved, we became able to do something, life had been unable to do up to this point.

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,819
One – expand knowledge quickly.

52
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,539
Two – preserve the knowledge gained over generations.

53
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,839
Three – build on past knowledge, to gain even deeper insight.

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,219
This seems daft, but until then, information had to be passed on from generation to generation,

55
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,299
mostly through genetics, which is not efficient.

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,779
Still, for the next 40,000 years, human life remained more or less the same.

57
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,859
There was little to build upon.

58
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,319
Our ancestors were only one animal among many.

59
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,799
Building a skyscraper without knowing what a house is… is hard.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,739
But while it is easy to be arrogant in our attitude to our ancestors, this would be ignorant.

61
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,839
Humans 50,000 years ago were survival specialists.

62
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,259
They had a detailed mental map of their territory,

63
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,819
their senses were fine-tuned to the environment,

64
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,219
they knew and memorized a great amount of information about plants and animals.

65
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:17,019
They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor skills

66
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,359
Their bodies compared to our athletes today just because of their daily routines,

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,899
and they lived a rich social life within their tribe

68
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,999
Survival required so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,879
might even have been bigger than it is today

70
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,119
As a group we know more today, but as individuals our ancestors were superior to us

71
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,299
But then around 12,000 years ago, in multiple locations, humans developed agriculture.

72
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,339
Everything changed very quickly.

73
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:54,379
Before, survival as a hunter and forager required superb physical and mental abilities in all fields from everybody

74
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:02,039
With the rise of the agricultural age, individuals could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival.

75
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,259
This meant that some of them could specialize.

76
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,019
Maybe they worked on better tools, maybe they took time to breed more resistant crops or better livestock,

77
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,159
Maybe they started inventing things.

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,059
As farming got more and more efficient, what we call civilization began

79
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,159
Agriculture gave us a reliable and predictable food source,

80
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,659
which allowed humans to hoard food on a large scale for the first time,

81
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,919
which is much easier to do with grains than meat,

82
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,999
The food stock required protection, which led to communities living together in tighter spaces

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,739
First, early defense structures were built, the need for organization grew

84
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,399
The more organized we got, the faster things became efficient

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,299
Villages became cities, cities became kingdoms, kingdoms became empires

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,039
Connections between humans exploded which led to opportunities to exchange knowledge

87
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,879
Progress became exponential

88
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,459
About 500 years ago the Scientific Revolution began

89
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,579
Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Biology, and Chemistry transformed everything we thought we knew

90
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,119
The Industrial Revolution followed soon after laying the foundation for the modern world

91
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,759
As our overall efficiency grew exponentially,

92
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,519
more people could spend their lifetime contributing to the progress of humanity

93
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,979
Revolutions kept happening.

94
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,259
The invention of the computer, its evolution into a medium we all use on a daily basis,

95
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,199
and the rise of the Internet shaped our world

96
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,999
It's hard to grasp how fast all of that happened

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,059
It's been about 125,000 generations since the emergence of the first human species

98
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,459
About 7,500 generations since the physiologically modern humans saw the light of day

99
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,559
500 generations ago, what we call civilization began

100
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,239
20 generations ago, we learned how to do science

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,959
And the Internet became available to most people only one generation ago

102
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,679
Today we live in the most prosperous age humanity has ever experienced

103
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,919
We have transformed this planet, from the composition of its atmosphere to large-scale changes in its landscape

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,259
and also in terms of the other animals in existence.

105
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,419
We light up the night with artificial stars and put people in a metal box in the sky

106
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,319
Some have even walked on our Moon

107
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,399
We put robots on other planets

108
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,499
We've looked deep into the past of the universe with mechanical eyes

109
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,199
Our knowledge and our way of acquiring and storing more of it has exploded

110
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,319
The average high school student today knows more about the universe than a scholar a few centuries ago

111
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,298
Humans dominate this planet, even if our rule is very fragile

112
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,779
We are still not that different from our ancestors 70,000 years ago

113
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,559
But your lifestyle has existed for less than 0.001% of human history

114
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,199
From here on, there's no saying what the future holds for us

115
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,519
We're building a skyscraper, but we're not sure if it's standing on a solid foundation

116
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,039
or if we're building it on quicksand

117
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,579
Let's leave it with that for now

118
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,259
The next time you miss your train, your burger is not hot enough, or someone cuts in line

119
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,139
Remember how special this made-up human world is

120
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,023
Maybe it's not worth being upset about all those little things.

121
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,263
OK, so this was our first take on making a history-related video

122
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:24,023
we'd love to make much more of them, but they take even more time than our average video.

123
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:26,023
So we might do 3 or 4 a year.

124
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,023
Your feedback's very welcome here
