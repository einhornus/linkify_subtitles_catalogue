1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,318
What if the state covered your cost of living, would you still go to work?

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,179
Go back to school?

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,449
Not work at all? What would you do?

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,188
This concept is called a universal basic income or UBI

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,919
And it's nothing less than the most ambitious social policy of our times

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,659
in 2017, basic income is gaining momentum around the world

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,499
First trials are ongoing or on their way

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,309
and a growing number of countries are considering UBI as an alternative to welfare

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,289
How would it work and what are the key arguments for and against?

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,419
Right now people can't really agree. What universal basic income is or should be

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,499
Some want to use it to eliminate welfare and Cupp bureaucracy

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:55,859
Others want it as a free extra for existing programs, or even want it to be so high that work itself becomes optional

13
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,579
For this video we'll talk mostly about the minimum basic income

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,599
enough money to be above the poverty line

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,739
in the US this means about $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,819
The money would not be taxed and you could do whatever you wanted with it in

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,159
In this scenario UBI is a way of transferring the wealth of a society

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,499
while still keeping the free market intact

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,039
But if we hand out free money will people just spend it on booze and stop working?

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,859
A 2013 study by the World Bank

21
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:36,739
specifically examined if poor people waste their handouts on tobacco and alcohol if they receive it in the form of cash

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,239
The clear answer, no they don't. The opposite is true

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,559
Other studies have shown that the richer you are, the more drugs and alcohol you consume

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,899
The lazy and drunk poor person is a stereotype rather than reality

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,359
What about laziness?

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,279
Universal basic income test runs done in Canada in the 1970s showed that around

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,619
1% of the recipients stopped working, mostly to take care of their kids

28
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,339
On average people reduced their working hours by less than 10%

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,539
The extra time was used to achieve goals like going back to school or looking for better jobs

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:22,039
But if laziness and drugs are not a huge deal, Why doesn't our current welfare state solve poverty

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,499
Welfare or unemployment programs often come with a lot of strings attached

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,639
Like taking part in courses,

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,099
Applying to a certain number of jobs a month or accepting any kind of job offer

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,479
no matter if it's a good fit, or what it pays

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,649
Besides the loss of personal freedom, these conditions are often a huge waste of time and only served to make the unemployment statistics

36
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,839
Seem less bad

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,799
Often your time would be much better spent looking for the right job

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,879
continuing education or starting a business

39
00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:01,039
Another unwanted side effect of many welfare programs is that they trap people in poverty and promote passive behavior

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,699
Imagine a benefit of $1,000 each month

41
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,299
in a lot of programs if you earn a single dollar extra the whole thing is taken away

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,099
If you take a job, that's paying $1200 you might not only lose your benefits,

43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,899
but because of your taxes and another costs like transportation

44
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,759
You might end up having less money than before

45
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,179
So if you actively try to better your situation, and your total income is not improving or even a shrinking

46
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,999
welfare can create a ceiling that traps people in poverty

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,859
and rewards passive behavior

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:42,059
A basic income can never be cut and  therefore getting a job and additional income would always make your financial situation better

49
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,299
Work is always rewarded

50
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,999
instead of a ceiling it creates a floor from which people can lift themselves up

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,099
But even if UBI is the better model, is it economically feasible?

52
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,959
What about inflation?

53
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,619
Won't prices just rise making everything just like it was before?

54
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,499
Since the money is not being created by magic or printers it needs to be transferred from somewhere

55
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,759
It's more of a shift of funds than the creation of new ones

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,119
Hence; no inflation

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,939
Ok, but how do we pay for it?

58
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,518
There's no right answer here because the world is too diverse

59
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,379
How well-off the country is, what the local values are,

60
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,259
Are things like high taxes or cutting the defence budget politically acceptable or not?

61
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,429
How much welfare state is already in place and is it effective?

62
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,689
Each country has its own individual path to a UBI

63
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,469
The easiest way to pay for a UBI is to end all welfare and use the free funds to finance it

64
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:54,239
Not only would this make a number of government agencies disappear, which in itself saves money, it would also eliminate a lot of bureaucracy

65
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,699
on the other hand cutting them could leave many people worse off than before

66
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:06,639
If the goal is to have a foundation for everybody there still need to be programs of some sort because just like countries,

67
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,959
People are not the same

68
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,819
The second way - higher taxes especially for the very wealthy

69
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,819
In the US for example there's been a lot of economic growth but most of the benefits from it have gone to the richest few percent

70
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,328
the wealth gap is rapidly widening

71
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:30,359
and many argue that it might be time to distribute the spoils more evenly to preserve the social peace

72
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,649
There could be taxes on financial transactions, capital, land value, carbon, or even robots

73
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,799
But UBI is not necessarily expensive

74
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,099
According to a recent study

75
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,979
a UBI of $1,000 per month in the US

76
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,299
Could actually grow the GDP by 12% over eight years

77
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,539
because it would enable poor people to spend more and increase overall demand

78
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,979
What about the people who do the dirty work?

79
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,679
Who will work in the fields, crawl through sewers, or lift pianos?

80
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,349
If you don't need to for survival, will people still do hard boring and unfulfilling labor?

81
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,599
UBI might give them enough leverage to demand better pay and working conditions

82
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,219
a study calculated that every extra dollar going to wage earners would add about $1.21 to the national economy

83
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,899
While every extra dollar going to high-income Americans would add only 39 cents

84
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,419
There would still be very rich and poor people

85
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,939
but we could eliminate fear, suffering, and existential panic for a significant part of the population

86
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,709
Making poor citizens better off could be a smart economic tactic

87
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:49,589
For some this isn't enough. They want a UBI large enough to live a middle-class existence

88
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:57,149
If we set the financial obstacle aside, this idea fundamentally challenges, how our society is constructed

89
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:04,199
By earning money, you earn the possibility to take part in society this determines your status and options

90
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:11,379
But it also forces many people into spending huge chunks of their time on things they don't care about

91
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,619
in 2016 only 33% of US employees were engaged at work

92
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:23,319
16% were actively miserable and the remaining 51% were only physically present

93
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,899
Would 67% of people stop working if they could?

94
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,566
It would be unfair to portray work as just a chore

95
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,079
work gives us something to do. It challenges us

96
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,559
it motivates us to improve, it forces us to engage

97
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,839
Many find friends or partners at work, we work for social status wealth and our place in the world

98
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,419
We're looking for something to do with our lives and for many people work gives them meaning

99
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,839
There are other concerns with UBI

100
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,799
If all welfare programs were exchanged for one single payment, this gives the government a lot of leverage

101
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,139
individual programs are easier to attack or cut than a multitude

102
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,639
or populist smite promise drastic changes to the UBI to get into power

103
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,139
and a universal basic income doesn't tackle all problems when it comes to equality

104
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,599
Rents for example

105
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,399
while $1,000 might be great in the countryside, it's not a lot for expensive metropolitan areas

106
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,158
which could lead to poor people moving outwards and the difference between rich and poor

107
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,819
becoming even more extreme

108
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,719
and of course, for some people, the concept of work itself not being essential for survival is appalling

109
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,939
Conclusion

110
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:49,328
So is the universal basic income a good idea? The honest answer is that we don't know yet

111
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,648
There needs to be a lot more research more and bigger test runs

112
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:59,919
We need to think about what kind of UBI we want and what we're prepared to give up to pay for it

113
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,329
The potential is huge. It might be the most promising model to sustainably eliminate poverty

114
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:16,289
It might seriously reduce the amount of desperation in the world and make us all much less stressed out

115
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,869
This video was made possible by a

116
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,889
