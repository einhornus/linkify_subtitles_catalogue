1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,719
An ant is pretty stupid.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,519
It doesn't have much of a brain, no will, no plan,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,679
and yet, many ants together are smart.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,319
An ant colony can construct complex structures.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,119
Some colonies keep farms of fungi, others take care of cattle. They can wage war or defend themselves.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,039
How is this possible?

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,179
How can a bunch of stupid things do smart things together?

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,899
This phenomenon is called emergence,

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,919
and it's one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of our universe.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,919
In a nutshell, it describes small things forming bigger things that have different properties than the sum of their parts.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,479
Emergence is complexity arising from simplicity, and emergence is everywhere.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:00,899
[Intro]

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,859
Water has vastly different properties to the molecules that make it up, like the concept of wetness.

14
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,599
Take wet fabric, If you zoom in far enough, there is no wetness.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,159
There are just molecules sitting in the spaces between the atoms of the cloth.

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,979
Wetness is an emerging property of water.

17
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:25,199
Something new only created by a lot of individual interactions between water molecules.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,639
And this is sort of it. Many things interact under a certain set of rules, creating something above and beyond themselves.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,079
It turns out that more is different.

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,679
This different property is itself a new thing, and that new thing can couple with other new things to repeat the process.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,039
You can imagine this as layers stacked upon each other every, layer made from more complex parts.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,739
Atoms form molecules.

23
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,739
Molecules form proteins.

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,579
Proteins make up cells.

25
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,259
Cells make up organs.

26
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,219
Organs form individuals.

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,179
Individuals form societies.

28
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,599
But how can something be more than the sum of its parts?

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:14,059
How do ants form the sort of cloudy entity that is a colony? By following a ruleset that produces order through chaos.

30
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,259
For example, let's look at how an ant colony distributes jobs.

31
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,079
Let's assume that a colony shall have 25% workers, 25% caretakers,

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,879
25% soldiers and 25% gatherers.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:35,279
Ants communicate their current job via chemicals. For example, the worker ant constantly secretes chemicals that say: "I'm a worker".

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,939
When ants meet other ants, they smell each other to gather information, telling each other their job and what they're doing.

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,699
Both keep track of who they met in the past.

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:52,399
Now, imagine an anteater kills most of the gatherers. If this isn't fixed quickly, the colony will starve.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,859
Many worker ants need to switch jobs, but how do you tell this to thousands of them?

38
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,319
Simple. You don't.

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,479
Our worker ant will still meet and smell other ants, but it will encounter almost no gatherers at all.

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,439
It counts too few gatherers, until it reaches a critical point, and then it changes its job.

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,639
The worker becomes a gatherer. Other ants will do the same, until after a while there are enough gatherers again.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,579
The balance is restored all by itself.

43
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:30,439
The actions and interactions of an individual are random. You can't plan which ant will encounter which other ant.

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,419
But the simple set of rules is so elegant that a colony's many operations emerge as a consequence.

45
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:45,719
On an even more fundamental level, hundreds of millions of complicated molecules interact to maintain a robust and amazing structure.

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,339
A being with vastly different properties than the sum of its dead parts emerges.

47
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,819
The smallest unit of life: a cell.

48
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,919
We still don't have a clear definition of what living things are, we just know they emerge from things that are not alive.

49
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,859
Cells combine and cooperate. They specialize and respond to one another,

50
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,179
and over time, we develop into complex organisms with remarkable capacities.

51
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:20,039
Your arms and legs and heart are an incredibly complex and complicated system made of trillions of individual stupid things...

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,239
...and yet we breathe, digest and watch YouTube videos.

53
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,019
How do your cells know what to do?

54
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,019
Think of the pacemaker cells in your heart.

55
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,319
Billions of them need to send out an impulse just at the right moment to collectively create a heartbeat.

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,119
Our cells exchange chemical information with their neighbor cells to see what they're up to, and then decide what to do.

57
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,719
If it's among a lot of cells that are working on the same task, it will start working on that task as well, and sync up with them.

58
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:00,479
There is no master mind giving commands. Just single units communicating with their neighbors, and acting according to the feedback they get.

59
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,079
What about our most important part? What is the thing that asks these kinds of questions?

60
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,479
Is our consciousness then an emergent property of the cells in our brain?

61
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,139
This question is too big and important, it deserves a video of its own.

62
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:24,859
Some things that emerge are hard to define. You can't touch an ant colony, only its parts.

63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,099
It has neither brain nor face, nor body.

64
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,619
And yet the colony interacts with the world.

65
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,299
Just like colonies emerge from ants, things emerge from humans, like Nations.

66
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,019
What actually is a nation, is it its population?

67
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,719
Is it its institutions, its symbols like its flag, colours or anthems?

68
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,579
The physical things it makes like cities, the territory it occupies?

69
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,719
All of these things are fluid.

70
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,299
Populations change and are replaced.

71
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,739
Institutions come and go, cities can be constructed and abandoned.

72
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:10,059
Borders have changed all the time for most of history, and symbols get replaced by new symbols.

73
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,559
A nation has no face, no brain, no body.

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,159
Are nations not real, then? Of course they are, just like ant colonies, nations interact with the world.

75
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,099
They can change landscapes, wage wars, grow or decline, and they can stop existing.

76
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,039
But they only exist because of a lot of humans interacting with each other.

77
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,839
But not just nations. All the complex structures that surround us emerge from us.

78
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,679
Even if we don't intend to, we are constantly creating.

79
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,839
Communities, companies, cities, societies.

80
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:55,959
All of these things are entities that have fundamentally different properties and abilities than the pretty stupid apes they emerged from.

81
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,419
We don't know why any of this happens.

82
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,379
We just observe it, and it seems to be a fundamental property of our universe.

83
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,979
It may be the most beautiful and wonderous property of our universe.

84
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:18,580
