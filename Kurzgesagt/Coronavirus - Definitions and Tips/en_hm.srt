00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,159
In December 2019 the Chinese authorities

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,259
notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,199
In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,339
This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,559
that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,099
What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do?

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,479
A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing.

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,279
It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,359
Corona may spread via surfaces,

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,139
but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,739
Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face,

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,079
say rubbing your eyes or nose.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,859
The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,899
Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect.

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,639
Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,419
The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,559
These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected.

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,679
Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material.

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,659
The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple:

21
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,779
copy and reassemble.

22
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,239
It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order,

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,259
self-destruct.

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,519
The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells.

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,979
The number of infected cells grows exponentially

26
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,699
After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs.

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,059
The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you,

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,799
your own immune system.

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,939
The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation.

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:26,479
And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,279
Cells have neither ears nor eyes.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,959
They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,679
Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,279
Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:50,359
In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,419
Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc.

37
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,579
First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells.

38
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,939
As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies.

39
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:13,299
The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide.

40
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,229
Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too.

41
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,259
The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill.

42
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,099
This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities.

43
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,519
In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control.

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:41,079
It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,739
Recovery begins.

46
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,199
The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms.

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,679
But many cases become severe or even critical.

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,239
We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified,

49
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,119
but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases,

50
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,399
Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone.

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,899
That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem.

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,459
Patients get pneumonia.

53
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,979
Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive.

54
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,599
The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons.

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,119
And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed.

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,179
They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely.

57
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,239
The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous.

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,619
While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic,

59
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,979
we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu.

60
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,879
There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow.

61
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,559
Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak.

62
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,359
A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives;

63
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,119
a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books.

64
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,259
The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection

65
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,519
because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down.

66
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,359
Why is this so bad?

67
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,559
In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time.

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,839
If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it.

69
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,539
There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody.

70
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,759
People will die untreated.

71
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,659
And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further.

72
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,279
If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't.

73
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,859
The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario.

74
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:01,419
To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic.

75
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,559
A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses.

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,319
Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals.

77
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,779
Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour,

78
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,379
to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things:

79
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,459
1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others.

80
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,979
Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands.

81
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,759
The soap is actually a powerful tool.

82
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,839
The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat;

83
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,619
soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you.

84
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,899
It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away.

85
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,959
To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeÃ±os and want to put in your contact lenses next.

86
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,519
The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience,

87
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,799
but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes.

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,519
If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function:

89
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:17,419
from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick.

90
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:24,599
On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home.

91
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,399
Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular.

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,319
But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time

93
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,339
So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it.

94
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,699
None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay.

95
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,019
The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start;

96
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,559
if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly.

97
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,979
If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish.

98
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,399
And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands.

99
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,059
Literally, and

100
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,159
figuratively.

101
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,879
A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video,

102
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,899
specially Our World In Data,

103
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,619
the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems

104
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,399
and how to make progress solving them.

105
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,979
Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona pandemic
