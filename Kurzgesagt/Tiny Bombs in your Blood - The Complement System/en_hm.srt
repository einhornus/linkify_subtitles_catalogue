1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,719
Every living being needs to fight off other living beings

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,739
That want to feast on them.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,579
So as multicellular live evolved over billions of years

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,059
It came up with ways to defend itself.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,579
Today, humans have a sophisticated defence network.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,939
Like physical barriers, defence cells, and weapons factories.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,079
But one of the most important defences of our body is largely unknown.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,059
The Complement System.

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,719
It evolved over seven hundred million years ago,

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,479
And is an army of over thirty different proteins,

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,379
That work together in a complex and elegant dance,

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,979
To stop intruders.

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,799
All in all,

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,379
About fifteen quintillion of them are saturating every fluid in your body right now.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,359
Guided by nothing but chemistry

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,899
These proteins are one of the most effective weapons we have against invaders.

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,899
Many other parts of the immune system are just tools

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,059
To activate the compliment system.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,919
But it's also really dangerous.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,519
Imagine having trillions of little bombs inside your blood

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,519
That could go off at any moment.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,159
So our cells use numerous mechanisms

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,219
To prevent complement from accidentally attacking them.

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,719
Ok,

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,159
What exactly does it do?

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:23,899
And, what makes it so dangerous?

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,119
In a nutshell,

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,639
The complement system does three things.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,879
It cripples enemies. It activates the immune system.

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,059
And it rips holes in things until they die.

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,239
But how?

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,099
After all,

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,679
These are mindless proteins.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,099
Randomly drifting around without will or direction.

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,599
Well,

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,319
This is actually part of the strategy.

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,859
Complement proteins float around in a sort of passive mode.

38
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,059
They do nothing.

39
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,719
Until they get activated, and change their shape.

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,319
In the world of proteins

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,559
Your shape determines what you can and cannot do.

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,959
Because shape determines what you can interact with

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,579
And in what way.

44
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,439
For example,

45
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,219
In your passive shape you might do nothing.

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,038
In your active shape however,

47
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,139
You might, for example, change the shape of other proteins.

48
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,599
Activating them, so they can activate others.

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,019
Mechanisms like this one

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,819
Can start cascades that spread very quickly.

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,179
Imagine the compliment proteins as being like

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,979
Millions of matches, very close together.

53
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,499
Once one catches fire, it ignites the ones around it.

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,259
They ignite more, and suddenly, you have a big fire.

55
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,179
To show the actual mechanisms of the complement system

56
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,819
Is a tad complicated and overwhelming.

57
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,079
So we'll simplify here.

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,219
Now, let's imagine you cut yourself

59
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,559
And a bunch of bacteria enter the wound and make it into the surrounding tissue.

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,279
Now a complement attack begins with C3.

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,539
C3 is the first match.

62
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,619
The initial spark that will start our fire.

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,759
And to do that, C3 needs to switch from passive to active.

64
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,399
How this happens is complex,

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,899
But let's just say it can happen randomly,

66
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,899
Through other complement proteins that bind to enemies,

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,759
Or through antibodies.

68
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,699
All you really need to know is that C3 breaks into two smaller proteins,

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,559
C3a and C3b,

70
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,059
That are now activated.

71
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,599
One of these parts, the C3b protein,

72
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,499
Is like a seeker missile, specialised in bacteria,

73
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,499
Fungi, and viruses.

74
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,139
It has a fraction of a second to find a victim,

75
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,179
Or it will be neutralised by water molecules.

76
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,179
If C3b does find a target,

77
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,419
It anchors itself very tightly to its surface and doesn't let go.

78
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,539
By doing so, the protein changes its shape again.

79
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,039
In its new shape, it is now able to grab other proteins,

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,659
And start a small cascade.

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,679
Changing its shape multiple times,

82
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,479
Adding other complement proteins to itself.

83
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,899
Finally, it transforms itself into a recruiting platform

84
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,699
Known as, C3 Convertase.

85
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,899
This platform is an expert at activating more C3 proteins,

86
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,799
That start the whole cycle anew.

87
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,119
An amplification loop begins.

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,299
Soon, thousands of proteins cover the bacteria.

89
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,999
For the bacteria, this is very bad.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,819
It can cripple the bacteria, and make them helpless or slow them down.

91
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,219
Imagine being covered by thousands of flies.

92
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,559
But there's more.

93
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,819
Do you remember the other part of C3?

94
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,739
The C3a protein.

95
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,319
C3a is like a distress beacon.

96
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,939
Thousands of them flood away from the site of battle.

97
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,819
Screaming for attention.

98
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,599
Passive immune cells notice the C3a proteins,

99
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,159
And awake them from their slumber,

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,299
To follow the protein tracks to the site of infection.

101
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,559
The more alarm proteins they encounter,

102
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,539
The more aggressive they get.

103
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,099
This way, complement guides reinforcements exactly to the place where they're needed the most.

104
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,759
So far,

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,719
The complement has slowed down the invaders and called for help.

106
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,619
Now, it's beginning to actively help to kill the enemy.

107
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,299
The first immune cells to arrive at the battlefield,

108
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,359
Are Phagocytes.

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,099
Which means cells that swallow you whole, trap you in a tiny prison,

110
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,199
Then kill you with acid.

111
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,219
But to swallow an enemy, they need to catch it first.

112
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,879
Which is not easy, because bacteria prefer not to be grabbed,

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,719
And are sort of slippery.

114
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,819
But now the complement that has anchored itself to the bacteria,

115
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,819
Acts as a sort of glue that makes it easy for the immune cells to catch their victims.

116
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,219
But it gets even better.

117
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,799
Imagine being covered in flies again.

118
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,079
Now imagine them turning into wasps.

119
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,539
Another cascade is about to begin.

120
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,079
On the surface of the bacteria,

121
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,979
The C3 recuritment platform changes its shape again,

122
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,399
And begins to recruit new proteins.

123
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,179
Together, they begin the construction of a bigger structure.

124
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,539
A Membrane Attack Complex.

125
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,979
Piece by piece new proteins, shaped like long spears,

126
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,779
Anchor themselves deep into the bacteria's membranes.

127
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,479
Until they rip a hole into them, that can't be closed again.

128
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,199
Fluids rush into the bacteria,

129
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,259
And their insides spill out.

130
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,459
They bleed to death.

131
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,059
The remaining bacteria are mained and distracted by the complement,

132
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,679
And quickly taken care of by the arriving immune cells.

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,759
The invasion has been nipped in the bud,

134
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,699
Before it had the opportunity to become dangerous.

135
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,159
You probably didn't even notice it.

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,099
But while bacteria are not happy about complement,

137
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,759
The enemies it might be the most useful against,

138
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,019
Are actually viruses.

139
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,839
Viruses have one problem.

140
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,119
They need to travel from cell to cell.

141
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,319
Outside of cells,

142
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,119
They're basically hoping to randomly bump against a cell to infect by pure chance.

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,659
Here, they're completely defenceless.

144
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,119
And here, complement is able to intercept and cripple them,

145
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,459
So they become harmless, and guide the immune system to devour them.

146
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,699
Without complement, virus infections would be a lot more deadly.

147
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,339
But wait, if we have such an effective weapon,

148
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,319
Why do we ever get sick?

149
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,659
The problem is that in a war, both sides adapt.

150
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,399
For example, when the vaccinia virus infects a cell,

151
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,999
It forces it to produce a protein that shuts complement activation down.

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,639
This way, the virus creates safe zones around the cells it infects.

153
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,599
When it kills them and tries to infect more, it has a higher chance of being successful.

154
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,599
Or some bacteria for example,

155
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,339
Can grab certain molecules from the blood that keep the complement system calm,

156
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,499
And make themselves invisible.

157
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,799
So the complement system, while being extremely important,

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,519
Is only one player in the complex and beautiful organisation, that is our immune system.

159
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,479
A beautiful example of how many mindless things, can do smart things together.

And it's hard to overstate how grateful we are for that.

165
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,839
In 2019, an average Kurzgesagt video took at least one thousand two hundred hours to produce.

166
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,619
We need months to research and write our scripts,

167
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,019
Clear them with experts,

168
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,779
Illustrate and animate every scene from scratch,

169
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,039
And to compose original music.
