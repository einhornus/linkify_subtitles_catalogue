1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:08,119
The Universe is incredibly big and seems full
of potential for life, with billions of habitable

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,590
planets.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,760
If an advanced civilization had the technology
to travel between the stars, at just 0.1%

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,150
of the speed of light, It could colonize our
galaxy in roughly 100 million years.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,710
Which is not that long given the billions
of years the milky way has existed – so

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,990
in principle any spacefaring civilization
should be able to spread rapidly over huge

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,050
sectors of the galaxy.

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,570
And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the
universe seems empty.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,579
Devoid of others.

10
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,280
This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed
in more detail in other videos.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,539
Confronted with the seemingly empty universe,
humanity faces a dilemma.

12
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,890
We desperately want to know if we are alone
in the Milky Way.

13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,900
We want to call out and reveal ourselves to
anyone watching but that could be the last

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,789
thing we ever do.

15
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,300
Because maybe the universe is not empty.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,720
Maybe it’s full of civilizations but they
are hiding from each other.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,450
Maybe the civilizations that attracted attention
in the past were wiped away by invisible arrows.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:27,940
This is the Dark Forest solution to the Fermi
paradox.

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,380
The Way Of Life

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,720
The hunter awakes in his hiding place and
carefully listens for suspicious noises from

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,610
the thick undergrowth before he gets up.

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,690
Another night has passed without incident.

23
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,479
The forest is dark and full of fog.

24
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,860
He considers calling out to others to end
his loneliness but stops himself at the last

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,930
moment.

26
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,649
What if they are like him?

27
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:01,619
All living things seek to survive, secure
resources and multiply.

28
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,400
Their greatest obstacle are other living things
that share the same objective.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,260
Competition between species favored the survival
of beings with advantageous traits.

30
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,550
Our ancestors were inventive, competitive,
expansionist and greedy for resources, which

31
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,500
led to them winning the competition for our
planet.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,270
Today, most other animals are so utterly at
our mercy that we wipe out about a dozen species

33
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,790
a day, just as an unintentional byproduct
of how we like to run things.

34
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,160
But humans are more than individuals.

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,690
From us cultures emerge, that also compete
with each other.

36
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,340
Competitive and expansionary cultures spread
faster and further and merge with, subdue

37
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,500
or destroy others.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,550
If we look at our history it becomes clear:
We are dangerous.

39
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,360
Not just to others but also to ourselves.

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,790
Our human nature has driven us to take over
every corner of our planet and soon we will

41
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,099
look to the stars, both to expand our domain
and ensure access to ever more resources.

42
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:10,280
And then we might stumble upon others trying
to do the same thing.

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,370
It is likely that the competition of life
also takes place on far away planets, so it

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,390
is logical to assume that an alien civilization
that came to dominate their planet would be

45
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,519
in some regards similar to us.

46
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,540
But if they are similar to us, they, too,
may be dangerous.

47
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,540
The Implication

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:40,340
As the hunter sneaks through the dark forest
all alone he knows that there might be others

49
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,690
like him.

50
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,760
He can’t know their intentions, if they
are aggressive or not.

51
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,590
The hunter knows he would kill to ensure his
own survival, so he has to assume that they

52
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,230
would too.

53
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:03,819
And it might be that if he stumbles upon another
hunter, the one that shoots first survives.

54
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,099
None of this means that conflict is unavoidable.

55
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:13,209
So far the progress of the modern world seems
to have made us more peaceful, not more violent.

56
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,910
Maybe this is true for other civilizations
too, that eventually progress means less conflict,

57
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,738
not more.

58
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:26,190
Different alien civilizations also should
vary from the mild and peaceful to the malevolent

59
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,430
and militaristic.

60
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,340
The existential problem we are facing is that
when we meet others between the stars, we

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,970
have no way of telling who is peaceful or
aggressive and what their true intentions

62
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,970
are.

63
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,150
Similarly, they might not understand or trust
our intentions even if we tell them that we

64
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,660
are peaceful.

65
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,620
On top of that, if we did discover another
civilization, and they discovered us, the

66
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,860
light years between us would mean years of
communication delay.

67
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,430
Both sides would be in a state of uncertainty,
wondering if the wisest move is to just attack,

68
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,930
because there's another serious issue: technological
explosions and first strike advantage.

69
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,639
We do not know where the limits of technology
are, but we do know how much technological

70
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,970
progress matters in war.

71
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:21,390
A few hundred or thousand years can turn conflict
with uncertain results into a one sided massacre.

72
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:28,160
Caesar's legions would stand no chance against
Napoleon's army with their cannons and muskets.

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,740
Which would be eradicated by artillery from
the first world war.

74
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,479
Which would not stand a chance against today's
drones and guided missiles.

75
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,590
So the power level of different civilizations
may vary massively and even if not, between

76
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,650
the time it takes us to detect another civilization
and us saying “hi” we might already be

77
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,440
hopelessly behind on the tech tree.

78
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,590
Which is bad enough, but the nature of interstellar
conflict makes this worse.

79
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,770
If your opponent is light years away, sending
an invasion fleet takes so long that by the

80
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,310
time it arrives it might be hopelessly obsolete.

81
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:10,050
So, war between civilizations might be just
about eliminating the other to remove an existential

82
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,980
threat to yourself.

83
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,699
Someone else who might be so scared of you
that they attack the first chance they get.

84
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,199
In this environment, the only way to guarantee
a win is to strike with such force and speed

85
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,150
that the target has no chance of survival
or time to counter-attack or escape to seek

86
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,479
revenge later.

87
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,400
The stakes are the highest possible with no
room for error.

88
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,140
If we assume that the majority of civilizations
live on planets that leaves them pretty vulnerable

89
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,480
– all you need to do is throw something
massive at a planet to make it uninhabitable.

90
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,410
So the ultimate interplanetary annihilation
weapon is probably something like a Relativistic

91
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,130
Kill Vehicle – a missile shot at a planet
at a significant fraction of the speed of

92
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,380
light.

93
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,389
For example, a missile the size of a person
going 95% the speed of light has as much energy

94
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,130
as all nuclear bombs on earth.

95
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,830
If you shot a few dozen at the civilization
you wanted to wipe out, success would be fairly

96
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,780
certain – even a single hit would suffice.

97
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,539
This is not that absurd of an idea – a civilization
only slightly above us on the Kardashev scale

98
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,759
would have enough energy to send multiple
strikes against every planet it suspects of

99
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,990
harboring life.

100
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,889
What makes these weapons so sinister is how
much they favor a first strike, since they

101
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,560
would be so fast that it might be impossible
to protect yourself effectively against them

102
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
once they’re launched.

103
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,199
Conflict between civilizations may not be
lengthy affairs but rapid winner takes all

104
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,130
situations, where the first one to shoot wins.

105
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,330
This makes any civilization an existential
threat to any other.

106
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,290
And if every civilization is an existential
threat to every other, there may be only two

107
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:02,550
kinds of civilizations out there: quiet ones
and dead ones.

108
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,210
So what should we do?

109
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,610
So, should we worry?

110
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,130
It is unlikely that anybody has noticed humanity
yet.

111
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,449
The radio signals we’ve transmitted in the
last 100 years traveled a relatively tiny

112
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,120
distance and have long decayed into unreadable
noise.

113
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,389
At our technological stage, if we don’t
actively try to get noticed and if nobody

114
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,840
specifically looks at our pretty unremarkable
solar system, we’ll stay hidden.

115
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,990
But one day we will venture into space in
a serious way and need to consider these kinds

116
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,330
of questions again.

117
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,690
We don’t know if there are others or if
we are going through the forest alone.

118
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,380
But we have no way of knowing for sure.

119
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,269
For the time being, it seems the best we can
do is to carefully listen.

120
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,700
And even if we see others step into a clearing
and make themselves known, we should not reply

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,839
right away but carefully watch them from the
undergrowth.

122
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,530
Perhaps we are also thinking about this all
wrong by allowing our primitive brain, that

123
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,600
evolved in the context of the gruesome competition
of life, to conjure fears of predatory aliens

124
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,660
all around us.

125
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,210
Maybe the fact that we are looking at the
universe like this is a sign that we are not

126
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,620
grown up yet as a species.

127
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,060
There could be a friendly, welcoming community
of alien civilizations waiting to hear from

128
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,080
us when we are ready.

129
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,510
As for now, the good news is there is actually
little we need to do.

130
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,930
We just need to be thoughtful about the signals
we send out into the galaxy, we need to watch

131
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:35,190
the sky and learn more about our galaxy, our
forest.

132
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,950
Because whatever the nature of our forest
is, full of dangers or friends, or nobody

133
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,430
at all, only careful observation can tell.

134
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,399
So let’s do that.

135
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,680
At last the hunter reaches a clearing and
finds a comfortable position.

136
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:04,450
Slowly the sun melts the fog away, lost in
thought he admires the vegetation until suddenly

137
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:10,560
– he is eye to eye with another hunter,
frozen in terror just like himself.

138
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,220
His mind is racing, considering all the different
options.

139
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,700
The hunter takes a deep breath and makes a
decision.

140
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:30,990
Maybe the only way out of the dark forest
is to step into the clearing together.

141
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:37,300
And with this hopeful picture, we say goodbye
to the year 12021 of the Human Era.

142
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,560
It was a wild year to say the least, still
much more fun than 12020.

143
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,530
Kurzgesagt had its most successful month ever
and published a book.

144
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,329
We tried a lot of new techniques and really
got into blender and Cinema4D, hiding more

145
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,660
and more 3D in our videos.

146
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,740
We have so many ideas for next year and big
and ambitious plans that we can’t wait to

147
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,370
share with you – and all of this was and
is possible because of your direct support

148
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,750
– thank you so much.

149
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,850
Kurzgesagt only works because of you.

150
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,750
So in tune with the end of the year we designed
a few products that will help you to visualize

151
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,260
your place in the universe.

152
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,709
Our very shiny “The Night Sky'' Poster shows
you the little piece of space we can see from

153
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:27,540
Earth with our own eyes, or travel further
out with our Stellar Zoom Collection that

154
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,300
depicts our home in space from an increasing
distance.

155
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,600
Or dream with our Space themed notebooks,
scenic posters and pins.

156
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,490
We design and produce every single product
with great care.

157
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,600
Getting something from our shop is the best
way to support kurzgesagt.

158
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,670
We hope you have a wonderful end of the year
and that 12022 is more fun and less exciting

159
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,140
than the last two years.

160
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,470
Thank you for watching.
