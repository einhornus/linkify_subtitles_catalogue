1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,639
Climate change is very much the same.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,359
There's never any good news,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,739
just graphics that get more and more red and angry.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,319
Almost every year it breaks some terrible record,

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,139
from the most intense heat waves to the fastest melting glaciers.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,919
It doesn't end, and it has no mercy.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,139
We have known for decades that rapid climate change is being caused by the emission of greenhouse gases.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:33,279
But instead of reducing emissions, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than the year before.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,099
And emissions are still growing.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,319
I wonder why?

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,539
Why is it so difficult to stop emitting these gases?

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,779
*Opening Theme*

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,739
~ Kurzgesagt: In a Nutshell ~

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,499
Our collective CO2 emissions can be expressed as a product of 4 factors, and their relationships with each other:

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,579
Two of them explain why the world's emissions are still growing,

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,318
and two  tell me how to stop it.

17
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,699
Population size,

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,279
economic growth,

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,759
energy intensity,

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,579
and emissions per unit of energy produced.

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,259
Number one: population growth.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,459
People need food, a house, clothes,

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,739
and they demand luxury goods -

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,719
from I-phones to $1 cheeseburgers.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,759
More people, higher CO2 emissions.  It's a very simple equation.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,059
The global population is growing and, according to the UN,

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,639
it will settle to around 11 billion by 2100

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,059
, which is 40% more than today.

29
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,539
The only way to slow this growth is through investments in public health,

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,379
access to contraceptives and education in developing countries.

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,479
But even with large investments, it would take a few decades

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,319
for the effects of lower fertility rates to manifest.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,019
So the population will continue to increase for the foreseeable future

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,979
and, as a consequence, global CO2 emissions

35
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,279
will increase over the next few decades.

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,279
Number two: Growth, or getting richer.

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,659
But it's not just about our numbers;

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,999
the richer and more developed we are, the more emissions our lifestyle produces.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,939
A programmer in the US has a larger CO2 footprint than 50 Ugandan farmers.

40
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,259
The wealth of the world grows almost everywhere.

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,959
And, despite being far from a fair distribution,

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,119
economic growth has led to the highest standards of living

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,239
and the greatest reduction in extreme poverty in human history.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,619
"Growth" has become the dominant mantra of the world's economies,

45
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,139
whatever political system they have.

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,179
Rich countries are unlikely to give up the concept of growth anytime soon;

47
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,899
but even if they gave up, developing countries want to get rich too.

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,279
For billions of people, ending growth would likely mean staying poor,

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,939
so developing countries are not willing to stop growing their economies.

50
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,819
Overall, we can be sure that growth as a guiding economic ideology is

51
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,079
not going to leave us anytime soon.

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,459
More countries and citizens around the world will grow and become richer,

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,699
while rich economies will continue to grow their wealth.

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,739
There are some signs that growth can be decoupled from CO2 emissions,

55
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,959
but we're not close to that yet.

56
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,719
As a consequence of this growth, CO2 emissions will rise.

57
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,219
OK.  So far, we've learned that

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,699
because of population and economic growth,

59
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,279
humanity's CO2 emissions will increase -

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,799
the opposite of what should be happening.

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,059
We need to slow down, peak, and then reduce annual emissions.

62
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,699
The next two factors describe how we can actually do this:

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,019
Number three: Energy intensity.

64
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,059
Energy intensity describes how efficiently we use energy.

65
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,939
A street griller in rural Brazil can burn charcoal for roasting,

66
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,339
while a street vendor in France can use an induction oven charged with nuclear energy.

67
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,019
The latter is much more efficient ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

68
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,599
The more efficient the item, the less energy it takes to accomplish something -

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,919
whether it's supplying a metropolitan area, or grilling kebab.

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,459
So making our technology efficient and finding more efficient ways to organize our societies

71
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,079
is one of the most important ways to reduce the modern world's dependence on CO2.

72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,759
This can have many meanings, from reducing energy consumption with artificial intelligence,

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,059
to electrifying the transport and industrial sectors,

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,999
or to sustainable concrete production.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,119
Opportunities for improvement are almost limitless,

76
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,899
and human ingenuity can run wild.

77
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,899
But we know that increasing efficiency alone will not be enough

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,579
, mostly for three reasons:

79
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,699
1/3 - Direct Repercussion Effects.

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,259
This means that as soon as something becomes more efficient,

81
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,659
that "something" is used more so, in general,

82
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,219
the greater efficiency does not generate as significant a reduction as thought.

83
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,119
Or worse: sometimes, more efficiency doesn't make humans use less of this resource, but more of it.

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,779
As planes became more fuel efficient, ticket prices dropped

85
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,879
and more people traveled by plane.

86
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,879
So making things more efficient doesn't automatically mean less energy expenditure in total.

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,839
It can even have the opposite effect.

88
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,239
2/3 - Indirect Repercussion Effects.

89
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,099
Sometimes, when you save money using something efficient, you can spend it on something else.

90
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,959
For example, if you buy a fuel-efficient car,

91
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,059
you save on fuel costs and end up with more savings in your bank account,

92
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,519
which you might spend on an airplane vacation.

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,099
So, in the end, you could end up emitting more CO2,

94
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,399
even though you have a more efficient car.

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,479
3/3 - Lower Return on Investment

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,579
Finally, the

97
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,579
more you invest in efficiency, the

98
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,559
harder and more expensive it becomes to become even more efficient.

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,039
So, over time, the return on investment goes down –

100
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,599
and with many technologies, we are already very efficient.

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,579
But no matter how efficient we make our savings,

102
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,279
as long as we need some energy, we will have emissions.

103
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,879
Efficiency alone will not create a carbon-free world.

104
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,299
This brings us to our last factor:

105
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,379
Number four: CO2 emissions per unit of energy consumed, or our global carbon footprint.

106
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,699
Humanity's global carbon footprint

107
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,259
is the amount of CO2 released per unit of energy generated.

108
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,779
For example, coal plants release much, much more CO2 than solar energy per unit of energy.

109
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,039
This relationship is crystal clear;

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,719
the more fossil fuels we burn, the greater our amount of CO2.

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,659
Fossil fuels are the biggest lever humanity has at the moment.

112
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,359
Of course, it is impossible to turn off coal and oil overnight

113
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,219
without throwing humanity into chaos.

114
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,699
But the reality is, what we do is not close enough to keep fossil fuels in the ground

115
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,319
and utilize low CO2 alternatives.

116
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,939
We need to do two things for this transition away from fossil fuels.

117
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,219
First, we need to use the levers we have today with current technology.

118
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,439
There are many things we can do very quickly:

119
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,819
we can keep nuclear plants online longer;

120
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,039
we can cut subsidies from the fossil fuel industry and target renewables;

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,099
we can charge more for CO2 emissions, and raise the price each year,

122
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,559
to encourage the world's industries to transition;

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,339
we can enforce strict standards for energy efficiency, and for any type of new construction;

124
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,659
we can abandon vehicles to alcohol/gasoline.

125
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,319
Then we also need to invent new and better technologies.

126
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,119
Without new technologies and innovation, it would be impossible to achieve a world free of carbon emissions,

127
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,099
whether through technologies such as carbon capture, or a new generation of nuclear power plants,

128
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,679
to batteries that would revolutionize the storage of energy from renewables.

129
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,999
But innovation takes time;  years, and decades.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,639
And we don't have that time.

131
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,819
Each year, we continue to add more carbon to the atmosphere.

132
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,559
This means that we cannot continue to rely on innovation alone.

133
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,539
We need to find ways to reduce emissions now,

134
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,599
while inventing what we will need in the future.

135
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,399
The less fossil fuel we burn over the next few years, the

136
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,619
more time we will give innovation to catch up.

137
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,719
The more low-carbon energy infrastructure we build today, the

138
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,158
more we can compensate for the economic growth and people born today.

139
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,539
The more coal plants under construction we prevent from being completed, the

140
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,499
more CO2 we "save".

141
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,419
Neither innovation nor the alternatives we use today alone can solve rapid climate change.

142
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,659
But innovation, coupled with a decisive move away from fossil fuels as much as possible today,

143
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,199
can do it.

144
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,579
Solving climate change will be tricky.

145
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,439
We have to consider the needs of billions of people and the reality that, at the moment

146
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,079
, society runs mainly on fossil fuels.

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,259
This will not change overnight, but it needs to change as soon as possible.

148
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,159
And it's still absolutely possible.

149
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,759
We'll look at different aspects of climate change, and how to tackle it, in other videos.  Let

150
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,239
us know what kinds of things you want to know more about -

151
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,819
here on Youtube, or join us on our subreddit.

152
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,999
This video is part of a series on climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy -

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,379
a coalition founded by Bill Gates that works to expand investments in clean energy

154
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,879
and support innovations that will move the world to near-zero carbon emissions.

155
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,059
We also especially thank the Our World in Data team for helping us with data and research.

156
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,059
