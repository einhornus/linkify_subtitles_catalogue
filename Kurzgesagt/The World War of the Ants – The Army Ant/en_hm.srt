1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:03,819
Some groups just don't get along.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:12,239
Every day, billions of soldiers fight a merciless war on thousands of fronts, and it's been going on for over 100 million years.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,759
The World War of the Ants.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:25,739
[Music]

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,879
Ants are ancient beings that arose around

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,119
160 million years ago and took over a wide variety of

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,919
ecological niches so successfully that they became one of the dominant animals on planet Earth.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,899
Today, they count more than

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,479
16,000 different species with over 10,000 trillion individuals.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,079
Collectively, ants alone make up 20% of the entire animal biomass on land.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,939
Similar to humans, their recipe for success is collaboration.

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,679
While a single ant is pretty useless, together, they are able to achieve stunning feats.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:13,359
They construct complex colonies, care for livestock, pursue agriculture, or have complex symbiotic relationships.

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,819
And of course, ants wage war.

15
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,939
Even among the same species, a constant state of conflict is pretty common.

16
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:28,659
Skirmishes, raids, and full-on invasions are happening every day, causing millions of casualties.

17
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,459
Let's look at some of the most interesting ones in a series of videos.

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,939
In this one, the army ant,

19
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,059
a swarm made for war.

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,439
The army ant group consists of about 200 different species.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,359
Army ants do not build nests;

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,099
they live a sort of nomadic lifestyle with groups of millions of individuals.

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,459
On a hunt, some species form large columns up to 100 metres long,

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,259
killing and immediately dismembering every insect or small vertebrate they encounter.

25
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,039
The biggest hunting parties can kill up to

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,499
500,000 animals per day.

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:15,159
Some army ants specialize in hunting and consuming other social insects, like termites, wasps, and especially other ants.

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,999
Wasps are fierce and may seem invulnerable, but if a swarm makes its way to their colonies, they don't even stand a chance.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,719
The much bigger and stronger wasps might kill a few of them, but they are quickly overwhelmed.

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,259
Even if their queen survives an attack, the army ants steal the colony's larvae and quickly devour them.

31
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,019
There is no recovery from that.

32
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,859
When army ants discover another ant colony, they immediately attack.

33
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,878
Now you might think this would be a more even battle, but it's not.

34
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,208
Because army ants act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective.

35
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,529
Most army ants are not particularly impressive individually,

36
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,459
but they can overwhelm their victims with sheer numbers before the victim colony can mount an effective defense.

37
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:11,179
And so invasions tend to be won by the attackers, and the prey colony is damaged significantly or is exterminated.

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,899
Interestingly, army ants don't fight army ants.

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,399
When two swarms encounter each other in the wild,

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,789
they either pass through each other, ignoring the other swarm, or both colonies just move away,

41
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,019
which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint.

42
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,959
Army ants that fought other army ants probably eradicated themselves millions of years ago.

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,079
Indeed they're so deadly that other ant species had to specialize to survive their presence.

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,219
Many species just panic and evacuate their nest when they notice army ant scouts,

45
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,429
carrying as many larvae with them as they can, in order to return and rebuild after the attack.

46
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,339
Other species have invented living bunkers since fighting is so futile.

47
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,439
They have worker classes that have big square heads.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,299
When army ants show up,

49
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,239
they use them to block the entrances to their nests, so the attackers have to give up after a while.

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,379
But not everybody is afraid of army ants.

51
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,259
Leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex societies

52
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,819
of any animal other than humans.

53
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:23,399
They live in extensive nests, many meters deep and across, harboring millions of citizens with a highly sophisticated division of labor.

54
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,979
Like huge soldiers, 100 times more massive than a worker.

55
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,939
Their sole purpose might be to defend their colonies against army ants.

56
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,419
They still have a nemesis though.

57
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:42,299
The diet of the army ant species Nomamyrmex esenbeckii consists mostly of the larvae of other ants.

58
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,939
Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier caste.

59
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,299
So far, they are the only known species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leafcutters.

60
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,879
When they find a leafcutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column.

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,819
The moment the leafcutter ants notice the army ant attack,

62
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,699
they go into crisis mode and immediately alert their soldiers, who very quickly swarm to the site of attack.

63
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,579
A frontline develops that can be a few meters wide and up to a meter deep.

64
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,019
The leafcutter soldiers go head-to-head with the army ants, locking on them and trying to cut through their heads.

65
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,299
Smaller leaf cutter workers help by grabbing the enemies.

66
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:30,059
Small teams carry out attacks behind the frontline, where they dismember their enemies by ripping their legs from their bodies.

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,419
The attackers meanwhile try to swarm their victim's soldiers, and sting them to death in a mob.

68
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:43,199
Despite the powerful defense and the determined response, the army ants are still superior in numbers.

69
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,179
So without knowing if the battle can be won, the leafcutters prepare for the worst.

70
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,739
Workers rush to create barricades and seal off as many entrances to their nest as possible to secure their route.

71
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,959
If the leafcutters are not able to repel the invaders, or at least barricade enough of their entrances in time,

72
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,479
the army ants swarm the nest, overrunning all opposition.

73
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,199
They penetrate deep into the hidden chambers and steal tens of thousands of the leafcutters' brood to eat them.

74
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,459
Even if the leaf cutter colony survives, this is a heavy blow.

75
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,819
Regardless who's won the war, thousands lay slain on the battlefield.

76
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,879
When the army ants attack, death follows them.

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,299
But there are other species that form much more dangerous ant armies.

78
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:39,819
Species that form supercolonies covering thousands of square kilometers over multiple continents engaging in wars kilometers across.

79
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,939
They deserve their own video though.

80
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,039
No matter the scale, war is a part of ant existence.

81
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,899
Be it between huge colonies, or small groups trying to fend off a raid.

82
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,959
In tropical rainforests, but also in the cracks of the concrete we walk over every day.

83
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,699
Humans have decided that war is not a thing that they want to do a lot anymore.

84
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,539
For ants though, the other ant will always be the enemy.

85
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:16,179
No, some groups just don't get along.

86
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:23,379
