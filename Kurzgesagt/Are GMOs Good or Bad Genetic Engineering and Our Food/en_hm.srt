1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,179
GMOs are one of the most controversial areas of science.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,179
Genetic engineering is used in many fields, but even though medical applications like GM insulin are widely accepted,

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,939
The debate heats up when it comes to food and agriculture.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,579
Why is that?

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,499
Why is the same thing treated so differently?

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:42,319
Let's try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts, the fears, and the future of GMOs.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,619
Humans have been genetically modifing plants and animals for thousands of years.

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,239
Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,099
Maybe one of your wolves was especially loyal.

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,119
So you did the smart thing, and bred the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,379
Traits suggest an expression of genes.

12
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,959
So with each generation, those genes got more pronounced.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,259
After thousands of years, almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different from its pre-domesticated state.

14
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,879
If humans have been changing genes for millennia, what makes a so called "Genetically Modified Organism", or GMO, different?

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,879
Selective breeding is basically hoping for lucky hits.

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,459
Genetic engineering eliminates this factor. We can choose the traits we want.

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,139
Make fruit grow bigger,

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,159
immune to pests, and so on.

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,979
So, why are people concerned about them ?

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,359
Let's start with one of the most common objections to GMOs.

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:51,659
Gene flow, meaning GM crops could mix with traditional crops and introduce unwanted new characteristics into them.

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:58,219
There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention, but is a big anti-GMO argument by itself.

23
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,559
Terminator seeds.

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,279
The idea is that they could produce sterile plants, requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,459
The very concept of this, however, caused a public outcry, stopping the technology being put to use.

26
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,659
This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA.

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:26,059
There have been cases of GMOs growing where they weren't planted, and traces of modified genes found in foreign crops.

28
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,299
But GM plants can't run wild entirely.

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,079
Many crops pollinate themselves, and all crops have to be related to mingle.

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,959
There are also cultural methods like buffer zones, to keep unintentional crossing at a minimum.

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,419
But if it's possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally cross with a non-GMO,

32
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,439
there's actually a more important question.

33
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,599
Is food that comes from GM crops different to food from non-GM crops?

34
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,779
This question has been a major concern from the very beginning.

35
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,999
GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible dangers, and the results are evaluated by multiple agencies.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,199
After more than 30 years and thousands of studies, the science is in.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,279
Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent.

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,239
But don't just take it our word for it, the sources for this and other claims are in the video description.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,919
But what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic?

40
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,279
For example, BT crops.

41
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:32,739
A gene borrowed from the bacterium Bacillus Thuringiensis, lets engineered plants produce a protein that destroys the digestive system of specific insect pests.

42
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,159
The plant makes its own pesticide.

43
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,199
Insects that eat it die.

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,059
That sounds alarming!

45
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,439
Pesticide sprays could be washed off.

46
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,959
While the poison in BT crops is inside the plant.

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,299
But actually, it's not a big deal.

48
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,739
Poison is really just a question of different perspectives.

49
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,979
What's harmless to one species, might kill another.

50
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,099
Coffee, for example, is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us.

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,719
Or take chocolate, it's dangerous for dogs but a pleasure for humans.

52
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:13,099
BT crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the digestive tract of certain insects; it's completely harmless for us.

53
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,199
There's also the opposite approach.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,919
Plants that are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers.

55
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,459
This way, farmers can use them widely, killing the other plants competing for resources without harming the crop.

56
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,779
Here, we get to the dark underbelly of GMOs.

57
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,879
For the pesticide industry, they are big business.

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,919
Over 90% of all cash crops in the US are herbicide resistant, mostly to glyphosate.

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,819
As a result, the use of glyphosate has increased greatly.

60
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,579
That isn't only bad, glyphosate is much less harmful to humans than many other herbicides.

61
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:55,199
Still, this means famers have a strong incentive to rely on this one method only, casting more balanced ways of managing weeds aside.

62
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,759
That's one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate.

63
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:08,259
Much of the criticism of this technology is actually criticism of modern agriculture and a business practice of the huge corporations that control our food supply.

64
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,199
This criticism is not only valid, it's also important.

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,119
We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model.

66
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:30,439
GMOs as a technology are actually an ally and not a enemy in that fight, helping to save and protect nature and minimize our impact on the environment.

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,919
Let's look at some positive examples.

68
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,639
Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh but often, whole harvests are destroyed by pests.

69
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,519
Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides.

70
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,359
Not only was this very expensive,

71
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,259
Farmers also frequently got sick.

72
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,659
The introduction of a new GM eggplant in 2013 stopped this.

73
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:57,459
The same BT protein we talked about before, an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans, was engineered into them.

74
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:05,799
This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80%. The health of farmers improved, and their income rose dramatically.

75
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,599
And sometimes, the GM approach is the only option.

76
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,739
In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ringspot virus which threatened to wipe out Hawaiian papaya.

77
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:30,019
The solution was a papaya genetically modified to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed.

78
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:40,559
All these stories show a very narrow application. 99% of all GMOs we use right now produce pesticides, or are resistant against them.

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,819
There is so much more we could do. The scientists are working on GMOs that could improve our diet.

80
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,719
Plants that produce more or different nutrients, like fruit with higher antioxidant levels that help to fight diseases

81
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,039
or rice with additional vitamins.

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,579
On a larger scale, we're trying to engineer plants more resilient to climate change,

83
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,639
plants that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions,

84
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,179
making them resistant to droughts or floods.

85
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,759
GMOs could also not only reduce agriculture's impact on the environment, but actively help to protect it.

86
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,219
Scientists are working on crops that can draw nitrogen from the air, like microbes.

87
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:26,119
Nitrogen is a common fertilizer, but its build-up pollutes the ground water and speeds up climate change.

88
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,439
Plants that collect their own nitrogen could fix two problems at once.

89
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,259
The over use of fertilizers in the developed world, as well as the shortage of it in developing countries.

90
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:44,999
We could even modify plants to become super-effective carbon collectors,  like the American chestnut tree, to mitigate and actually reverse climate change.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,599
With the tools we have today, our imagination is the limit.

92
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,299
The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day.

93
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,339
A UN estimate suggests we'll need 70% more by 2050.

94
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,839
We could grow that food by clearing more and more forests to create fields and pastures and by using more pesticides.

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,859
Or we find a way to do it on the land we've got right now, with more effective methods like GM crops.

96
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,179
Intensifying farming instead of expanding it means GMOs could become the new organic.

97
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:30,019
In a nutshell, GMOs have the potential to not only drastically change agriculture but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior.

98
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:39,579
GMOs could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere.

99
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,139
