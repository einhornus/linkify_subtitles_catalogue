1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,299
Imagine NASA announced today
that they found aliens.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,979
Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish
in the oceans of Europa,

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,459
and also ancient alien ruins on Titan.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,359
Wouldn't that be great?

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,059
Well, no. It would be horrible news,

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,859
devastating even.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,499
It could mean that the end of humanity
is almost certain

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,039
and that it might be coming soon.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,099
Why?

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,379
Why would the most exciting
discovery of our lifetime

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:40,319
be bad?

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,479
Let us imagine the development of life,

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,679
from its inception to us today,

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,579
as a flight of stairs.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,879
The first step is dead chemistry
that needs to assemble itself

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,259
into self-replicating patterns,
stable and resilient,

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,219
but also able to change and evolve.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,919
The second step is for our early life to
become more complex,

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,319
able to build more complicated structures,

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,619
and use the available energy
much more efficiently.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,139
On the next step, these cells combine
to become multicellular beings,

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,299
enabling unbelievable variety
and further complexity.

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,819
The step above sees the species
evolve big brains,

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,019
enabling the use of tools, culture
and shared knowledge,

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,999
which creates even higher complexity.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,579
The species can now become the
dominant lifeform on its planet,

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,179
and change it according to its needs.

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,559
First shy attempts to leave its
planet are happening.

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,439
This is where we are now.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,719
It's in the nature of life as we know it

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,059
to reach out, to cover every
niche it can.

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,899
And since planets have a limited
carrying capacity and lifespan,

33
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,839
if a species wants to survive,

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,959
it will look for more places
to spread to.

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,939
So the steps above the current
ones seem logical:

36
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,319
colonize your own solar system,

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,979
then spread further to reach
other stars,

38
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,959
to the possible final step:
becoming a galaxy-wide civilization.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,259
It's very likely that this is a universal
principle for civilizations,

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,038
no matter where they're from.

41
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,359
If a species is competitive and driven
enough to take control over its planet,

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,079
they'll probably not stop there.

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,379
We know that there are up to 500 billion
planets in the Milky Way,

44
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,159
at least 10 billion Earth-like planets.

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,739
Many have been around billions
of years longer than Earth.

46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,679
But we're observing zero
galactic civilizations.

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,019
We should be able to see something...

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,399
...but there's nothing.

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,579
Space seems
to be empty and dead.

50
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,399
This means something is preventing living
things from climbing the staircase,

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,619
beyond the step we're on right now.

52
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,899
...Something that makes becoming
a galactic civilization

53
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,319
extremely hard, maybe impossible.

54
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,339
This is the Great Filter.

55
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,319
...A challenge or danger so
hard to overcome,

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,919
that it eliminates almost every
species that encounters it.

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,579
There are two scenarios:

58
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,699
One means we are incredibly
special and lucky,

59
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,099
the other one means we are doomed
and practically already dead.

60
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,919
It depends on where the filter
is on our staircase:

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,779
behind, or ahead of us?

62
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,339
Scenario 1:

63
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,119
Scenario 1:
The filter is behind us.

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,219
We are the first.

65
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,059
If the filter is behind us,

66
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,999
that means that one of the steps we passed

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,719
is almost impossible to take.

68
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,479
Which step could it be?

69
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,439
Is life ITSELF extremely rare?

70
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,799
It's very hard to make predictions
about how likely it is

71
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,619
for life to emerge from dead things.

72
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,619
There is no consensus.

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,379
Some scientists think it develops everywhere
where the conditions are right;

74
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,519
others think that Earth might
be the

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,599
ONLY living place in the universe.

76
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,299
Another candidate is the step
of complex animal cells.

77
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,259
A very specific thing happened
on this step,

78
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,439
and as far as we know, it happened
exactly once.

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,119
A primitive hunter cell
swallowed another cell,

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,819
but instead of devouring it,
the two cells formed a union.

81
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,979
The bigger cell provided shelter,

82
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,679
took care of interacting with the
environment and providing resources,

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,699
while the smaller one used its
new home and free stuff,

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,639
to focus on providing a lot of extra
energy for its host.

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,559
With the abundant energy, the host cell
could grow more than before

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,059
and build new and expensive things
to improve itself,

87
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,299
while the guest became the
powerhouse of the cell.

88
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,919
These cells make up every
animal on the planet.

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,979
Maybe there are billions of bacteria-covered planets in the Milky Way,

90
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,059
but not a single one, apart from us,

91
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,179
has achieved our level of complexity.

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,579
...or intelligence.

93
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,919
We humans feel very smart and
sophisticated

94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,359
with our crossword puzzles and romantic novels.

95
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,479
But a big brain, is first and foremost,

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,619
a very expensive evolutionary investment.

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,779
They are fragile,

98
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,179
they don't help in a fistfight with a bear,

99
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,159
they cost enormous amounts of energy,

100
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,999
and despite them, it took modern humans,

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,199
200,000 years to get from sharp sticks
to civilization.

102
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,719
Being smart does not mean you get
to win automatically.

103
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,199
Maybe intelligence is just not so great,

104
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,339
and we're lucky that it worked out for us.

105
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,599
Scenario 2:

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,759
Scenario 2:
The filter is ahead of us.

107
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,699
Plenty of others died already.

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,399
A Great Filter before us is orders of magnitude more dangerous

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,019
than anything we encountered so far.

110
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,419
Even if a major disaster killed most of us or threw us back thousands of years,

111
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,959
we would survive and recover. And if we can recover,

112
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,419
even if it takes a million years, then it's not a Great Filter,

113
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,419
but just a roadblock to an eventual galactic civilization.

114
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,559
On universal timescales, even millions of years are just the blink of an eye.

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,819
If a Great Filter really lies before us,

116
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,639
it has to be so dangerous,

117
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,219
so purely devastating and powerful,

118
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,799
that it has destroyed most, if not all,

119
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,139
advanced civilizations in our galaxy

120
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,319
over billions of years.

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,339
A really daunting and depressing hypothesis

122
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,719
is that once a species takes control over its planet,

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,639
it's already on the path to self-destruction.

124
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,639
Technology is a good way to achieve that.

125
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,179
It needs to be something that's so obvious,

126
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,239
that virtually everybody discovers it,

127
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,179
and so dangerous, that its discovery leads almost universally

128
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,719
to an existential disaster.

129
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,159
A large-scale nuclear war,

130
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,219
nanotechnology that gets out of control,

131
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,899
genetic engineering of the perfect super bug,

132
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,359
an experiment that lights the whole atmosphere on fire.

133
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,799
It might be a super-intelligent AI

134
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,239
that accidentally (or purposely) destroys its creators.

135
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,939
Or things that we can't even see coming right now.

136
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,399
Or it's way simpler:

137
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,579
species competitive enough to take over their planet

138
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,759
necessarily destroy it while competing with each other for resources.

139
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,439
Maybe there are runaway chain reactions in every ecosystem

140
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,659
that once set in motion, are not fixable.

141
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,679
And so once a civilization is powerful enough to change the composition of its atmosphere,

142
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,859
they make their planet uninhabitable

143
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,899
100% of the time.

144
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,299
Let's hope that that's not the case.

145
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,119
If the filter IS ahead of us,

146
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,599
our odds are really bad.

147
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,959
What we can hope for.

148
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,859
THIS is why finding life beyond Earth would be horrible.

149
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,219
The more common life is in the universe,

150
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,719
and the more advanced and complex it is,

151
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,239
the more likely it becomes that a filter is in front of us.

152
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,819
Bacteria would be bad,

153
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,639
small animals would be worse,

154
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,439
intelligent life would be alarming.

155
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,259
Ruins of ancient alien civilizations...

156
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,599
would be horrible.

157
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,979
The best case scenario for us right now

158
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,039
is that Mars is sterile,

159
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,659
that Europa's oceans are devoid of life,

160
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,839
and the vast arms of the Milky Way

161
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,179
harbor only empty oceans hugging dead continents.

162
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,979
...That there are billions of empty planets waiting to be discovered

163
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,579
and to be filled up with life.

164
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,779
Billions of new homes...

165
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,419
waiting for us...

166
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,179
to finally arrive.

167
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,359
How likely is it that we'll find life outside of Earth that is similar to us?

168
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,799
Well, that depends on how many planets there are out there

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,019
in their star's Goldilocks Zone--

170
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,479
the area around the star where water can be liquid.

171
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,439
Because stars come in all sizes and configurations,

172
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,319
this zone is different for every star system

173
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,619
and requires a little bit of physics to figure out.

174
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,879
If that sounds like fun to you, this quiz from Brilliant

175
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,379
helps to break down the maths for exactly how this is calculated.

176
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,519
Brilliant is a problem-solving website

177
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,799
