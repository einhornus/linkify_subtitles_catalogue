00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,633
Three Reasons to Stop Nuclear

2
00:00:03,634 --> 00:00:06,696
Weapons 1. Proliferation of

3
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:10,909
Nuclear Weapons Nuclear Technology Puts the World in Tension

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,151
1944 The following year after a successful experiment

5
00:00:14,152 --> 00:00:18,570
Two bombs destroyed two cities

6
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:20,787
After that Nuclear technology

7
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,508
developed as a power source, but

8
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:32,618
always  Nuclear weapons cannot be made without nuclear weapons technology that was linked to nuclear weapons technology The

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,312
Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Treaty

10
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:37,518
states that the transfer of nuclear weapons technology

11
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,638
is limited to peaceful uses,

12
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:43,728
but now five countries have

13
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:47,295
acquired nuclear weapons with this technology.  It is difficult to distinguish

14
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:57,671
between a nuclear weapons program and the peaceful use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear

15
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:00,893
technology was sold to a small country as a peaceful technology, but

16
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,727
it became a

17
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:09,407
nuclear weapon.

18
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:12,257
2. Nuclear waste and pollution

19
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:16,408
Used nuclear fuel contains radioactive and toxic

20
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,888
plutonium.

21
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:24,744
It takes tens of thousands of years to become non-harmful.

22
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:27,894
Plutonium can be extracted from it by a process called

23
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:31,746
reprocessing, and it becomes a

24
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:34,446
nuclear weapon.  It

25
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:38,683
can be used and reused,

26
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:41,730
but there is no suitable nuclear reactor for reuse.

27
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,745
1 mg kills a person and a bomb can be made with a few kilograms. A

28
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,894
wonderful country Germany

29
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:51,048
has tons of this. In the

30
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,597
old days, reprocessing was good.  It's because I saw it. The

31
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:56,599
dumping place is also a problem. The

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,677
sea is banned, so I'll bury it, but

33
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:11,703
I haven't found a place to last for tens of thousands of years.

34
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:18,764
Only Finland has

35
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,865
3. Accidents and Disasters There were seven major accidents

36
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:26,057
in the use of nuclear weapons for more than 60 years,

37
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:29,639
three of

38
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,803
which

39
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:36,272
released large amounts of radioactivity into the environment

40
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:39,758
1957 1986 2011

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,981
Russia Ukraine Japan

42
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:47,137
has created an uninhabitable place for decades. It

43
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:51,932
is believed that there are thousands of deaths.

44
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:55,524
Disasters occurred in different types of nuclear reactors at

45
00:02:55,525 --> 00:03:01,791
different times in different countries

46
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:04,449
.  Is the energy supply

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,889
worth the disaster every 30 years?  Is

48
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,130
30%

49
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:13,271
worth Fukushima every 10 years

50
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:15,849
? Where can I contaminate?

51
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,757
Where is the line that is impossible anymore

52
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:22,688
? Should nuclear power be used?

53
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:25,367
Risks come with benefits, but

54
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:29,991
you should think more ethically than profits and losses Anyone

55
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:34,019
who wants to know another aspect of nuclear power
