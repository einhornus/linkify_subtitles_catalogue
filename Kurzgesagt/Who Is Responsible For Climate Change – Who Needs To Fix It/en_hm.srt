1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,679
Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,299
over 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide or CO₂, into the Earth's atmosphere.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,659
In the year 2019, we were still pumping out around 37 billion more.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:23,019
That's 50 percent more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago.

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,939
And it's not just CO₂,

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,719
we're also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:39,859
Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we're emitting 51 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year.

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,579
And emissions keep rising.

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,199
But they need to get down to zero.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,739
In recent years, the consequences have become more serious and visible.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,999
Almost every year breaks some horrible record:

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,379
We've had more heat waves, the most glaciers melting, and the lowest amount of ice ever recorded at the North Pole.

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,059
Of the last 22 years, 20 have been the hottest on record.

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,999
The only way to limit this rapid climate change is to decrease our collective emissions quickly.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,419
But although all countries agree on this goal in principle,

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,459
they do not agree who is responsible or who should bear the heaviest load.

17
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,239
The developed countries point at their own efforts to reduce emissions

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,119
and the fact that the large developing countries on the rise, especially China,

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,539
are currently releasing much more CO₂.

20
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,639
On the other hand, developing countries argue that emissions by the West are lifestyle emissions,

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,439
while for developing countries, they are survival emissions.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,119
Others call rich countries hypocrites that got rich by polluting without restraint

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,699
and now expect others not to industrialize and stay poor.

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,919
So who is responsible for climate change and CO₂ emissions?

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,659
And regardless of the past, who needs to do the most today?

26
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,899
In this video, we'll talk exclusively about nation-states.

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,799
We'll look at the fossil fuel industry in another video.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,219
Question 1 of 3: Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today?

29
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,439
In 2017, humans emitted about 36 billion tons of CO₂.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:28,119
More than 50% came from Asia. North America and Europe followed with 18% and 17%.

31
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,359
While Africa, South America, and Oceania together only contributed eight percent.

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,659
China is by far the world's largest emitter with 10 billion tons of CO₂ every year,

33
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,719
or 27% of global emissions.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,719
It's followed by the USA with 15% and the European Union with around 10%.

35
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,099
Together, this is more than half of the world's CO₂ emissions.

36
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,359
So it's clear that without the willingness and action of these three industrial blocs,

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,359
humanity will not be able to become carbon neutral and prevent severe climate change.

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,779
Next on our list is India at seven percent, Russia at five percent, Japan at three percent,

39
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,499
and Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Canada all just short of two percent.

40
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,519
Together with the first three, the top 10 are responsible for 75% of global emissions.

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,259
But if we only look at the current situation, we're not getting the full picture.

42
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,259
Question 2 of 3: Which countries have emitted the most in total?

43
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,019
If we look at emissions throughout history until today, the outlook changes drastically.

44
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,859
The US and the EU both knock China off the top spot.

45
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,979
The US is responsible for 25% of the world's historical emissions emitting 400 billion tons,

46
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,759
mostly in the 20ᵗʰ century.

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,579
In second place is the EU at 22%.

48
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:06,899
China comes in third at just under 13 percent, around half of the USA's contribution.

49
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,119
India's contribution shrinks to 3 percent along with the whole of Africa and South America.

50
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,639
The UK is responsible for one percent of annual global emissions

51
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,339
but takes five percent of the historical responsibility.

52
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,839
Germany, producing two percent of emissions per year today, has contributed almost six percent,

53
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,419
as much as the whole of Africa and South America combined.

54
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,819
So the narrative that rapid climate change is really the responsibility of the developing world

55
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,579
is hard to defend if facts matter to you.

56
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,519
But this is still not the whole story, because focusing on countries mixes two things:

57
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,079
population numbers and total emissions.

58
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,059
If a country has more people in general, its emissions are of course higher.

59
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,519
Things look very different if we look at individuals like you, dear viewer.

60
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,939
Question 3 of 3: Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide per person?

61
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:18,259
The average human is responsible for around five tons of CO₂ each year, but averages can be misleading.

62
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:25,459
The countries with the largest CO₂ emissions per person are some of the world's major oil and gas producers.

63
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,539
In 2017, Qatar had the highest emissions at a hefty 49 tons per person,

64
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:39,279
followed by Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Brunei, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia.

65
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,079
But those are outliers.

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,979
Australians have one of the highest carbon footprints per person: 17 tons a year.

67
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,239
That's more than triple the global average

68
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,579
and slightly more than the average US American and Canadian at 16 tons.

69
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,179
The Germans do a little better at close to 10 tons, but this is still twice the global average.

70
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,759
China may be the world's largest emitter,

71
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,039
but it's also the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people,

72
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,659
18.5% of the world population.

73
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,159
Per person, it's above average at seven tons.

74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,259
Historically, CO₂ emissions have been closely tied to a high standard of living.

75
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,219
Wealth is one of the strongest indicators of our carbon footprint, because as we move from poor to rich,

76
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,879
we gain access to electricity, heating, air conditioning, lighting, modern cooking,

77
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,399
cars or planes, smartphones, computers, and interact with people across the world online.

78
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:50,139
The enormous rise of China's CO₂ emissions is coupled with the greatest reduction of poverty in history.

79
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,819
If we order CO₂ emissions by income,

80
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,559
we see that the richest half of countries are responsible for 86% of global emissions

81
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,999
and the bottom half for only 14%.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,299
The average German emits more than five times as much as the average Indian.

83
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:15,019
In just 2.3 days, the average American emits as much as the average Nigerian in a year.

84
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,819
And not only that, the harsh reality is that

85
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,039
it's the countries that contribute least to the problem that stand to lose the most from rapid climate change.

86
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,119
The developing world will be hit the hardest.

87
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,679
The consequences could be food insecurity, conflicts over resources,

88
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,279
harsher and more frequent natural disasters, and large climate refugee movements.

89
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,559
Question 4... of 3: So who should take responsibility?

90
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,279
Many of today's richest countries are in a convenient position.

91
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,679
They have become rich over centuries of fossil fuel burning and industrial production.

92
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,979
They have a large historical footprint, and their wealth means they still emit a lot per person.

93
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,339
But their country's annual emissions are now dwarfed by other countries,

94
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,899
because the giant that is China is finally catching up, and other giants like India are on their way.

95
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:18,419
Many Germans, for example, wonder how if Germany only accounts for two percent of yearly emissions,

96
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,399
it can have a meaningful impact on reducing emissions.

97
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,159
The answer is simple.

98
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,879
For one, the richest countries have the resources, highly educated workforces, and technology

99
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,819
to develop low-cost, low-carbon solutions and spread them around the world.

100
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,699
If we don't want poorer countries to become as fossil fuel-dependent as we are,

101
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,658
we need low-carbon technology to be cheap and available.

102
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,379
And we're getting there.

103
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:52,159
The cost of renewables is falling quickly and a variety of solutions are on the horizon for many different sectors.

104
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,459
But it needs to happen much faster.

105
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,199
If the rich countries of the West decide to seriously tackle rapid climate change,

106
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,679
the rest of the world would follow, because it has no choice.

107
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,279
Just like when the European Union enforced energy efficiency standards for technology,

108
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,319
the rest of the world adopted them too, because they wanted to be able to continue trading with the block.

109
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,099
Still, this doesn't absolve others of their responsibility.

110
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,279
China is the largest CO₂ emitter today, and it's China's responsibility to grow in a way

111
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,059
that will make it possible to transition to a zero-carbon world in time.

112
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:36,579
Others acting irresponsibly yesterday is a horrible excuse for repeating the same mistakes today.

113
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,719
Climate change is a global problem, and no country alone can fix it.

114
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,579
Working out who's responsible is not as simple as it seems, and in a way, it's a daft question,

115
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,119
but one that has plagued international politics for decades.

116
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,439
In the end, it's pretty simple.

117
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,319
Everybody needs to do the best they can, and right now we are all not doing that.

118
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,779
But we can begin today.

119
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,639
This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy,

120
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,779
a coalition founded by Bill Gates that's working to expand clean energy investment

121
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,779
and support the innovations that will lead the world to net zero carbon emissions.

122
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:25,699
Also, a special thanks to the team at Our World in Data for helping us out with data and research.
