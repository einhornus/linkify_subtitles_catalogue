1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,839
What is the largest star in the universe?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,499
And why is it that large?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,939
And what are stars anyway?

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,739
Things that would like to be stars

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,439
We begin our journey with Earth.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,219
Not to learn anything,

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,839
Just to get a vague sense of scale.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,279
The smallest things that have some star like properties

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,639
are large gas giants or sub-brown dwarfs.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,259
Like Jupiter,

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,559
the most massive planet in the solar system.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,139
11 times larger and 317 times more massive than Earth,

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,139
and more or less made of the same stuff as our sun.

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,759
Just much, much less of it.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,679
The transition toward stars begins with been dwarfs,

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,299
failed stars that are a huge disappointment to their mums.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,519
They have between 13 and 90 times the mass of Jupiter.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,379
So even if we took 90 Jupiters, and threw them at each other,

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,919
although fun to watch, it wouldn't be enough to create a star.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,659
Interestingly, adding lots of mass to a brown dwarf doesn't make it much bigger,

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,619
just it's insides denser.

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:11,359
This increases the pressure in the core enough, to make certain nuclear reactions happen slowly,

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,899
and the object glow a little.

24
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,819
So brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy gas giant

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,359
that don't fit into any category very well.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,339
But we want to talk about stars not failed wannabe stars, so let's move on.

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,959
Main sequence stars

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,479
Once large gas balls pass a certain mass threshold,

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,499
their core become hot and sense enough to ignite.

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,379
Hydrogen is fuss to helium in their cores, releasing tremendous amounts of energy.

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,039
Stars that do that, are called main sequence stars.

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,819
The more massive a main sequence star is, the hotter and brighter it burns, and the shorter its life is.

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,679
Once the hydrogen burning phase is over, stars grow,

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,099
Up to hundreds of thousand of times their original size.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,959
But these giant phases only last for a fraction of their lifespan.

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,719
So we'll be comparing stars at drastically different stages in their lives.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,879
This doesn't make them less impressive,

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,239
But maybe it's good to keep in mind that we'll be comparing babies to adults.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,239
Now, back to the beginning.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,759
The smallest real star, are red dwarfs, about 100 times the mass of Jupiter,

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,459
Barely massive enough to fuse hydrogen to helium.

42
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,219
Because they're not very massive, they are small, not very hot and shine pretty dimly.

43
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,419
They are the only stars in the main sequence that don't grow when they die

44
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,359
but sort of... fizz out.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,679
Red dwarfs are by far the most abundant type [of stars] in the universe

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,159
Because they burn their fuel very slowly, it lasts them up to ten trillion years,

47
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,719
a thousand times the current age of the universe.

48
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,959
For example, one of the closest stars to Earth is a red dwarf star, Barnard's star.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,999
shines too dimly to be seen without a telescope

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,939
We made a whole video on red dwarfs if you want to learn more.

51
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,959
The next stage are stars like our sun.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,119
To say the sun dominates the solar system is not doing it justice,

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,899
since it makes up 99.6% of all it's mass.

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,639
It burns far hotter and brighter than red dwarfs which reduced its lifetime to about 10 billion years.

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,039
The sun is 7 times more massive than Barnard's star,

56
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,139
but that makes it nearly 300 times brighter, with twice it's surface temperature.

57
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,979
Let's go bigger.

58
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,819
Small changes in mass produce enormous changes in a main sequence star's brightness.

59
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:51,279
The brightest star in the night sky, Sirius A, is two solar masses, with a radius 1.7 times that of the sun.

60
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,099
But it's surface is nearly 10,000℃, making it shine 25 times brighter.

61
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,179
Burning that hot reduces it's total lifespan by 4 times, to 2.5 billion years.

62
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:12,519
Stars close to ten times the mass of our sun have surface temperatures near 25,000℃.

63
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:19,838
Beta Centauri contains two of these massive stars, each shining with about 20,000 times the power of the sun.

64
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,099
That's a lot of power, coming from something only 13 times larger [than the sun].

65
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,239
But they'll only burn for about 20 million years

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,679
Entire generations of these blue stars die in the time it takes the sun to orbit the Galaxy

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,459
So is this the formula?

68
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,939
The more massive, the larger the star.

69
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,359
The most massive star that we know is R136a1.

70
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,559
It has 315 solar masses, and is nearly 9 million times brighter than the sun.

71
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,239
And yet, despite its tremendous mass and power, it's barely 30 times the size of the sun.

72
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,119
The star is so extreme and barely held together by gravity that it loses

73
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,099
321 thousand billion tonnes of material through its stellar wind.

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,359
Every single second.

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,359
Stars of this sort are extremely rare because they break the rules of star formation a tiny bit.

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,319
When supermassive stars are born, they burn extremely hot and bright,

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,279
and this blows away any extra gas that could make them more massive.

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,299
So the mass limit for such a star is around 150 times the sun

79
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,839
Stars like R136a1 are probably formed through the merging of several high mass stars

80
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,079
in dense star forming regions, and burn their core hydrogen in only a few million years.

81
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,779
So this means they are rare and short lived.

82
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,619
From here, the trick to growing bigger isn't adding more mass,

83
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,199
To make the biggest stars, we have to kill them.

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,259
Red giants

85
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,979
When main sequence stars begins to exhaust the hydrogen in their core,

86
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,119
It contracts, making it hotter and denser.

87
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,959
This leads to hotter do faster fusion, which pushes back against gravity,

88
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,859
and makes tee outer layer swell, in a giant phase.

89
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,819
And these stars become truly giant indeed.

90
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,779
For example Gacrux, only 30% more massive than the sun,

91
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,339
It has swollen to about 84 times it's radius.

92
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,439
Still, when the sun enters the last stage of its life, it will swell and become even bigger.

93
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,399
200 times its current radius.

94
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,059
In this final phase of its life, it will swallow the inner planets.

95
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,279
And if you think that's impressive, let's finally introduce the largest stars in the universe

96
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,179
Hypergiants

97
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,439
Hypergiants are the giant phase of the most massive stars in the universe.

98
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,199
They have an enormous surface area that can radiate an insane amount of light.

99
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,719
Being so large, They're basically blowing themselves apart, as gravity at the surface is too weak

100
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,939
to hold on to the hot mass which is lifted away in powerful stellar winds.

101
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,419
Pistol star is 25 solar masses, but 300 times the radius of the sun,

102
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,079
a blue hypergiant, aptly named for its energetic bye star light.

103
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,399
It's hard to say exactly how long pistol star will live, but probably just a few million years.

104
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,439
Even larger than the blue hypergiants, are the yellow hypergiants.

105
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,199
The most well studied is Rho Cassiopeiae, a star so bright

106
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,999
it can be seen with the naked eye although it's thousand of light years from Earth.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,399
At 40 solar masses, this star is about 500 times the radius of the sun and 500,000 times brighter.

108
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,839
If the Earth was as close to Rho Cassiopeiae as it is to the sun,

109
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,099
It would be inside it, and you would be very dead.

110
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,739
Yellow hypergiants are very rare though.

111
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,819
Only 15 are known.

112
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,719
This means they're likely just a short-lived intermediate state,

113
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,059
as a star grows or shrinks between other phases of hypergiantness.

114
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,219
With red hypergiants, we can reach the largest stars known to us,

115
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,539
probably the largest stars even possible.

116
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,619
So who's the winner of this insane contest?

117
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,959
Well, the truth is we don't know.

118
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,979
Red hypergiants are extremely bright and far away, which means even tiny uncertainties in our measurements

119
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,538
can give us a huge margin of error for their size.

120
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,579
Worse still, red hypergiants are solar system size behemoths that are blowing themselves apart,

121
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,959
which makes them harder to measure.

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,419
As we do more science and our instruments improve, whatever the largest star is change.

123
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:53,279
The star that is currently thought to be among the largest we've found is Stevenson 2-18.

124
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,999
It was probably born as a main sequence star a few tense of times the mass of the sun

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,259
And has likely lost about half its mass by now.

126
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,479
While typical red hypergiants are 1500 times the size of the sun,

127
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,419
the largest rough estimate places Stevenson 2-18 at 2150 solar radii.

128
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,579
and shining with a list half a million times the power of the sun.

129
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,659
By comparison, the sun seems like a grain of dust.

130
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,959
Our brains don't really have a way of grasping this kind of scale.

131
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,879
Even at light speed, it would take you 8.7 hours to travel around it once.

132
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,679
The fastest plane on Earth would take about 500 yars.

133
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,019
Dropped on the sun, it would fill Saturn's orbit.

134
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:47,959
As it evolves it will probably shed even more mass, and shrink into another, hotter hypergiant phase

135
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,239
Accumulate heavy elements in its core before finally exploding in a core collapse supernova,

136
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,359
giving its gas back to the galaxy.

137
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,979
This gas will then go on to form another generation of stars of all sizes,

138
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,839
starting the cycle of birth and death again, to light up our universe.

139
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,259
Let's make this journey again, but this time, without the talking.

140
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,259
The universe is big.

141
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:37,279
There are many large things in it.

142
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,119
If you want to play a bit more with size stuff, we have good news.

143
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,239
We've created our first app, Universe in a Nutshell, together with Tim Urban, the bring behind Wait but Why.

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,319
You can seamlessly travel between the smallest things in existence,

145
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,679
past the coronavirus,

146
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,739
human cell, and dinosaurs,

147
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,359
all the way to the largest star and galaxies,

148
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,959
and marvel at the whole observable universe.

149
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,219
You can learn more about each object, or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all.

150
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:13,179
The app is inspired by the scale of the universe website by the Huang twins, that we spent a lot of time with when it came out years ago,

151
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,079
and felt that it was finally time to create a Wait but Why and Kurzgesagt version.

152
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,319
You can get it on your app store, there are no in-app purchases, and no ads.

153
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,479
All future updates are included.

154
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,199
And since this is our first app, we'd love to hear your feedback so we can improve it over time.

155
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,359
If this sounds good to you, download the Universe in a Nutshell app now, and leave us a 5 star review if you want to support it.

156
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,719
Kurzgesagt and all the projects we do are mostly funded by viewers, like you.

157
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,279
So if you like the app, we'll make more digital things in future.

158
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,339
Thank you for watching

159
