1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,838
Timer makes sense in small pieces

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:11,289
But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,629
So let's start small, with minutes hours days

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:23,618
You probably spent the last 24 hours of mostly sleeping and working and you probably wasted a good chunk of

5
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,868
yesterday on the internet

6
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,489
Days become weeks weeks become months and then we have a year

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,648
Let's look at 2017

8
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:41,019
France started to Train Eagles to hunt terrorist drones. paycheque nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern and

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,929
People on the internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know ,the usual stuff

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,299
let's go back further...

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,369
A kid born in the first year of the 21st century is 18 years old now

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,808
But the century is still young even if you're not

13
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:05,978
It was largely shaped by the attacks on 9/11 which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq in

14
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:12,339
March 2011 the Syrian civil war began and is still ongoing after seven years

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,529
Most of us were born in the 20th century

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,419
Which had the two most devastating wars in human history and the Cold War for

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,629
The first time ever we could destroy ourselves with the nuclear weapons, and we almost did

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,599
But we also had a space race and left earth for the first time

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,519
The internet was also invented which led to memes but also to Facebook and Twitter

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,989
So all in all we're not sure if this was a good development

21
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:44,078
The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of recent history

22
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,109
The oldest living person on earth is currently Celino Jaramillo who was born in 1896?

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,319
Which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day?

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,679
Only 250 years ago the Industrial Revolution

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,309
Turned the world into a progress machine the farmers became workers and knowledge became easier to distribute

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,959
Around this time we started the progress that is causing climate change today

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,299
Not that long ago actually

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,519
The theory of evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:26,709
Newton wrote down his theory of gravity we discovered distant stars and very close bacteria

30
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,829
The 15th century was very eventful

31
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:36,579
Columbus's discovery of america and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle Ages

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,709
War was all the rage in the Middle Ages

33
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:47,019
But the number one killer was disease the Black Plague killed every third European in just six years

34
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,799
Around 2,000 years ago we set the arbitrary year one of our calendar that most of the world follows today

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,458
But to a Roman the world was already ancient

36
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,339
the great pyramids were constructed

37
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,669
4,500 years ago so to a Roman the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today

38
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,649
so long ago that there was still living mammoths on earth a

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,789
Lot of history happened before that even around 7,000 years ago humans began writing things down

40
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,199
about 12,000 years ago human organization exploded

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,819
We built our first temple and around the world mankind began farming

42
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,869
Which enabled the rise of larger communities our dominance over planet Earth really begins here?

43
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:41,018
Homo sapiens sapiens the modern human evolved at least 200,000 years ago

44
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,259
50,000 years ago the cognitive revolution expanded our minds and innovation back

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,109
Then we shared earth with at least five other human species that either died out or were killed by us

46
00:03:53,110 --> 00:04:01,089
at least 2 million years ago our ancestors already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone

47
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,419
And six million years ago the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed

48
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,569
So this graph is all of human history

49
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:16,569
Our close relative Homo erectus survived 10 times longer than we have existed

50
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:23,799
This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,519
Still all of human history is not that long

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,639
65 million years ago the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion

53
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,699
The dinosaurs ruled the earth for over 165 million years

54
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,429
27 times as long as all humans

55
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:49,479
That's so long that it means a t-rex that lived at 65 million years ago is closer to us today

56
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,989
than to a live Stegosaurus

57
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,329
Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today

58
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,499
Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,519
the earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea creatures then came insects that wrapped ours and

60
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,019
Finally around 200 million years ago mammals joined the party

61
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:21,189
Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it appeared up to 4.1 billion years ago

62
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:28,508
for at least 3.5 billion years life consisted only of single-celled organisms

63
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:37,029
4.5 billion years ago the Sun was born from a gigantic imploding gas cloud 60 million years later earth formed in

64
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,848
In those early years frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the earth with large oceans

65
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:49,188
But as far as the whole universe goes how solar system is pretty new

66
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,359
Thirteen point seven five billion years ago the universe was born

67
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,708
And about half a billion years later our own galaxy formed from billions of stars

68
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:07,158
But what came before the Big Bang the truth is we don't know and maybe we never will.

69
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,248
And there you have it the past

70
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:13,458
Now let's take a look at what we know about the future.

71
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:21,708
In roughly 1 billion years the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible the death of the Sun 4 billion years later

72
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:24,678
Marks the end of life in the solar system

73
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:33,138
If we want to have a chance to survive we need to have ventured to the Stars and what happens after that in

74
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:40,338
The next 100 billion years most of the biggest stars around will die the universe becomes dimmer and dimmer

75
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,908
illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs

76
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:50,268
But they too will eventually burn out and one day the last star in the universe will die

77
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:56,778
The universe will turn dark and at some point even black holes will evaporate and die

78
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:01,489
When they do our universe will reach its final stage heat death?

79
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,299
Nothing changes anymore the universe is dead

80
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,248
forever

81
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:13,788
Now you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now aren't you we are - it's only natural

82
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,868
The good news is this is all far far away

83
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:21,528
The only time that actually matters is now

84
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:27,109
That cute girl or boy you like ask them out time is precious

85
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:35,089
Make it count

86
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,779
One of the questions we get asked the most is how we make animated videos

87
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,769
The short answer is with Adobe After Effects and years of training

88
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,459
But if you'd like to get a glimpse we now have something for you

89
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,699
we made Skillshare tutorials explaining in detail how we animate scenes from our videos if

90
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:59,329
You aren't already familiar with it Skillshare is an online learning community with more than 18,000 classes in things like writing

91
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,549
animation and video editing

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:09,199
Their premium membership gives you unlimited access to high-quality classes from professionals working in their fields so you can improve your skills

93
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,069
Unlock new opportunities and do work that you really enjoy

94
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,199
It's also extremely affordable the annual subscription is less than ten dollars a month

95
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,639
The first 1,000 people to sign up get their first two months for only 99 cents

96
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,769
So if you want to learn new things and support cuts cos øx. Give it a try

97
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:34,279
How did you like this remake. We're thinking about redoing a few of our older videos in the next one or two years

98
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,609
Any videos you would like to see redone?
