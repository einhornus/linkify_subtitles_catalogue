1
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:40,704
Shurik told us this story.
He collected folklore during the holidays:

2
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,251
Maybe this story is
just a legend...

3
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:51,755
But according to Shurik, it really
happened in one of the mountainous regions.

4
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:58,302
He didn't say which one, so as not to
be unfair to other areas

5
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:02,722
where exactly the same story could have happened
...

6
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:12,273
Well, where are you, well...

7
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:16,943
But... Damn it...

8
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,935
Damn the day I
sat down  for the wheel of this vacuum cleaner!

9
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,437
Do not despair!

10
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:08,486
No wonder the great and wise
Abu-Akhmat-ibn-Bey, the first driver of

11
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,781
this car, spoke: mind you, Edik ...
- Edik.  - Sasha.

12
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:17,744
Bear in mind, Edik, Allah alone knows where the
spark goes for this unworthy

13
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:22,289
geek in the glorious family of
internal combustion engines.

14
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:26,751
May his carburetor dry up
forever and ever!

15
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:05,083
- I'm sorry.
- Yes?

16
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,460
Sorry, I
have a big request for you.

17
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:13,923
- You are welcome.  - Can I ask you to
go only along the highway, without turning?

18
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:17,801
- Why is that?  - Yes, my donkey
is following you, as if tied.

19
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:18,844
- Donkey?
- Well, yes.

20
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,931
So he was following me?
- He, he!

21
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:26,392
- And I thought... - No, he is!

22
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,813
- Are you from here?
- Yes, I came to my aunt for the holidays.

23
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:34,441
And I'm on a business trip.
Is it far from the city?

24
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:36,734
- Two kilometers.
- Thanks.

25
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:49,870
You see, not a step without you.

26
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,083
- Year of birth?  - 42nd.

27
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:59,920
- Purpose of visit?
- Ethnographic expedition.

28
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,715
- Understandably.  Looking for oil?
- Not really.  I'm looking for folklore.

29
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,761
I will write down old
fairy tales, legends, toasts.

30
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:16,017
Toast?  Darling, you are extremely
lucky.  I will help you.

31
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:19,978
What is it?

32
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,313
- You need a toast.
- Yes.

33
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:26,359
A toast without wine is like
a wedding night without a bride.

34
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:31,905
- No, I don't drink.
- Do I drink?  What is there to drink?

35
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:39,036
You misunderstood me.
I don't drink at all.  Do you understand?

36
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,916
- I have no physical ability.
- That's about it - the first toast.

37
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:51,796
- Toast?  I'll write it down now...
- Then you'll write it down.  Take a glass.

38
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:59,761
My great-grandfather says: I have a desire to
buy a house, but I don’t have the opportunity ...

39
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:06,225
I have the opportunity to buy a goat,
but I don’t have the desire.

40
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:13,773
So let's drink to ensure that our desires
coincide with our capabilities.

41
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:39,711
- Well done.  - So.
- Listen to another toast.  - So...

42
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:48,177
- I'll be right back.
- Nothing, I'll take a breather.

43
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,264
I'll get some air, otherwise it's all an office, an
office, an office ...

44
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:10,278
- Where are you disappearing to?
- What's the matter?

45
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:15,199
- My niece.
- Very nice.  - Nina.

46
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:18,202
- Student.  Studying at the Pedagogical
Institute.

47
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:23,456
- Will prepare our shift, yes?
- Excellent student, Komsomol member, athlete.

48
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:26,167
- Sportswoman?
- My uncle knows everything about me.

49
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,376
An excellent student and a Komsomol member - is
this just what we need?

50
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:30,295
What do you need?

51
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,672
- I have an unexpected question for you
.  - You are welcome.

52
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:40,553
- How do you feel about marriage?
- Well, generally positive.

53
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,304
It's too early for her to think about it.

54
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:45,891
It’s never too early for anyone to think about this and it’s
never too late, by the way, right?

55
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:51,437
And how do you feel about our celebration of the
opening of the Wedding Palace?

56
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:54,148
- I'll definitely come.  - Come, yes?
- Necessarily.

57
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:58,567
I will have a small but
responsible assignment for you.  - Which?

58
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:02,655
- Let's see, yes.
Waiting for you.  - OK then.

59
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:16,834
And when the whole flock flew
south for the winter,

60
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:25,590
one small bird said:
"Personally, I will fly right into the sun."

61
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:35,433
She began to rise higher and higher,
but very soon burned her wings

62
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:40,520
and fell to the very bottom of the gorge.

63
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:49,152
So let's drink to the fact that none of us,
no matter how high he flew,

64
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:55,449
would never break away from the team.

65
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:03,247
- What, what happened, dear?
- I'm sorry about the bird!

66
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,502
And the princess, out of anger, hanged herself on
her own scythe, because

67
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:14,173
he accurately counted how many
grains were in the bag, how many drops in the sea,

68
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:19,051
and how many stars were in the sky.
So let's drink to cybernetics!

69
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,477
To health!

70
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:34,023
To health!

71
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:58,251
Dear friends!
Today we have a joyful,

72
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:01,670
bright, sunny holiday.

73
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:11,471
In a few seconds, these silver
scissors will cut this silk ribbon

74
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:17,683
and open to all the newlyweds of our
region a direct path

75
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:20,853
forward to a bright future,
you understand,

76
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:23,730
fortunately, love and
harmony, you understand,

77
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:27,609
through our
Wedding Palace.  We give the

78
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,910
honor of opening the

79
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:50,878
Palace to a beautiful woman, a
girl who

80
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,717
personifies the new destiny of
a mountain woman, you understand.

81
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,056
This is a student, a
Komsomol member, an athlete,

82
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,475
and finally, she is just a beauty!

83
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:17,775
This is the small
but responsible task.  I ask you to.

84
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:42,463
As our wonderful
satirist Arkady Raikin says, a

85
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,923
woman is a man's friend.

86
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:52,429
Wait a minute... Please slow down,
I'm taking notes.

87
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,683
- Who is this?  - Probably the press.
- Oh, the press.

88
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:00,644
As our wonderful
satirist Arkady Raikin says, a

89
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:03,355
woman is a man's friend.

90
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:09,110
Grandiose!  Let's drink to a woman... Give me the

91
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:15,574
horn, give me the horn, I'm telling you,
it's my horn.

92
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:24,331
...and disrupted the grand opening
of the Wedding Palace.

93
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:31,796
Then on the ruins of the chapel...
- Excuse me, did I destroy the chapel too?

94
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,923
No, it was before you, in the 14th century.

95
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,306
All this, of course, is true.  All this is true.
The paper is written correctly.  Everything is fine.

96
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:51,186
So it's on the one hand, right?
But there is another side of the coin.

97
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:57,108
A violator is not a violator, but a
major scientific worker, a

98
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:01,862
man of intellectual labor.
You came to visit us, didn't you?

99
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:08,660
Collect our fairy tales, legends there,
you know, toasts ...

100
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:11,870
- Toasts?
- Toast, yes.

101
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:16,207
And he did not calculate his strength, right?

102
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:21,670
We're dealing with an industrial accident here
.

103
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:27,216
I have wonderful toast!

104
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,515
You, comrade Shurik, have a wrong
idea about our places.

105
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:42,813
Everyone knows that Kuzbass is an
all-Union forge,

106
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:49,527
Kuban is a granary, and the Caucasus is an
all-Union - what?  - Health!

107
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:57,742
Not!  The Caucasus is an all-Union
forge, and a health resort, and a granary.

108
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:02,912
Where have you been?  Last night I remembered a
wonderful toast for you.

109
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,624
- Let's go faster.
- No, wait, dear.

110
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,960
We will talk with Shurik, and for now,
write down your toast in 3 copies

111
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:14,672
and then submit it in writing.
- Will be done!

112
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:22,179
I dream of writing down some
old rite, and participating in it,

113
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,347
well, that would be absolutely great.

114
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:31,936
In our area you will no longer meet
these grandfather customs and rituals.

115
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:39,735
Maybe somewhere high in the mountains you
will find something for science.

116
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:44,572
- Let's go to the mountains.  - That's right.
It's your job.

117
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:51,453
You have come to record fairy tales, and we
are working to make the fairy tale come true!

118
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:58,000
I brought you a toast.

119
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:03,213
- Bad, right?  - Well ...
What do you allow yourself, listen?

120
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,257
You asked for 3 copies...

121
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:06,432
To live, as they say, is good!

122
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:12,270
- A good life is even better!
- Exactly!

123
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,986
Aren `t you ashamed.
You hate an orphan.

124
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,488
She has no one but her uncle and
aunt.  25!

125
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:30,744
- Not true.  I appreciate your
niece, but there is a limit to everything.  eighteen!

126
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:37,708
Have a conscience!  After all, you don’t
get a goat, but a wife, and what kind: a

127
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:42,962
student, a Komsomol member, an athlete, a
beauty!  And for all this I ask

128
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:46,424
25 rams, it's even ridiculous to bargain.

129
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:49,593
You're being apolitical, to be
honest.

130
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:54,555
You don't understand the political situation.
You see life from the window of my car.

131
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:00,477
25 sheep!  When our district...

132
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:03,021
did not fully pay
off the state for wool.

133
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:06,815
And you do not confuse your personal wool
with the state!

134
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:16,574
I, comrade Dzhabrail, have been placed here
to look after the interests of the state.

135
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:19,910
Sit down for now.

136
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:33,254
- In general, like this: 20 rams ...
- 25!

137
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:36,632
- 20. Refrigerator "Rosen Lion"...
- What?

138
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:42,804
Finnish, good, certificate of honor...
- And a free ticket... - To Siberia!

139
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,938
- OK then.  - OK then.

140
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:05,948
So so.  The groom agrees,
relatives too, but the bride ...

141
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:12,620
We still educate
our youth badly.  Very bad.

142
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:16,832
Surprisingly frivolous attitude
to marriage.

143
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:21,878
And who even asks the bride?
Head bag and poof!

144
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:28,842
Yes, that's right.
A very correct decision.

145
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:33,304
Only I personally will not have
anything to do with this.

146
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:38,434
Don't worry.  It will be done by complete
strangers.

147
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:43,313
- Yes.  And not from our area.
- Well, of course.

148
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,527
This is not a lezginka for you, but a twist.
I show everything first.

149
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:57,074
With the toe of your right foot, you crush the cigarette butt,
like this.

150
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,746
You crush the second cigarette butt with the toe of your
left foot.

151
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:09,292
And now you crush both cigarette butts together.

152
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,745
Fish ...

153
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:24,488
- Sold?  - It's my business.

154
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:29,074
Just a minute, yes, yes.  It will pass, it will pass.
Right, aha, like this, forward!

155
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:37,081
Baranov in the stall.  Refrigerator in the house.

156
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,587
Where are you going?

157
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:50,009
Go home.

158
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:54,180
You won't get anything.
Steal such a girl.

159
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,598
Athlete, Komsomol member.

160
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:04,146
By the way, in the neighboring area, the
groom stole a member of the party.

161
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:32,294
Well, Sasha, you are making amazing
progress.  - Oh, that's nonsense.  - Nonsense?

162
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:39,258
- A trifle, insurance.
- Well, I give you a more difficult task.

163
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:42,427
So, what is it?

164
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:47,224
- Pack in a sleeping bag.
- There is.  - And as quickly as possible.

165
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:54,187
- Wait.  Time.  - Yes Yes Yes.
- Get ready, attention, start!

166
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:10,034
Ready!

167
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:16,873
Will you sleep standing up?  Time.

168
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,001
Carefully!

169
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,091
Hold on, Shurik.  Now I will take you out.

170
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:16,472
There are two of them...

171
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,601
- And this one has a tail.
- The tail doesn't count.

172
00:26:22,936 --> 00:26:27,564
- Second extra.  - Witness.
- And if...

173
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:30,818
- Only without victims.
- Yes, we have to wait.

174
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:33,528
That's right, we'll wait.  Give it up.

175
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:52,669
- What is it?  Also folklore?
- No, this is our student.

176
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:57,381
- A song about bears.  - Yes?
- But it won't work for you.  - Why?

177
00:26:58,173 --> 00:27:00,926
- This is student folklore.
Let's, let's.  - Yes?

178
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:04,012
Well, okay, listen.

179
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:15,688
Somewhere in the world
, Where it's always cold.

180
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:20,192
Bears rub their backs
on the earth's axis.

181
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:24,738
Centuries are floating by,
Sleeping under the ice of the sea,

182
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:29,742
Bears are rubbing against the axis, The
earth is spinning.

183
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:38,332
... the earth is spinning faster.

184
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,052
They twist, trying,
They turn the earth's axis,

185
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:56,722
So that the lovers had to
meet before.

186
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,101
So that one morning
Earlier, a year or two,

187
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:06,022
Someone said to someone the
Main words.

188
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,582
Following the spring downpour
Dawn will come earlier

189
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:33,461
And for two happy ones
Many, many years.

190
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:37,548
Lightnings will sparkle,
Streams will ring,

191
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:42,427
Fog will swirl,
White as a bear.

192
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:05,196
Somewhere in the world
, Where it's always cold.

193
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,284
Bears rub their backs
on the earth's axis.

194
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:14,245
Centuries are floating by,
Sleeping under the ice of the sea,

195
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:18,874
Bears are rubbing against the axis, The
earth is spinning.

196
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:28,299
... the earth is spinning faster.

197
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:09,625
Well, goodbye, Shurik.  You directly,
and me to the base.

198
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:15,338
- Well, Nina, goodbye.
- Goodbye

199
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:39,482
- Wait, Nina.  - What, Shurik?
- Allow me to accompany you.

200
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,836
You have not justified the high trust placed in you
.

201
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:08,757
- Impossible to work.
- You give unrealistic plans.

202
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:13,636
Is it like him?  Voluntarism!

203
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:23,060
- In my house - do not express yourself!
- What did I say?

204
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:35,320
Ah well?  Here's your advance...
...we refuse.  Take it!

205
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:42,410
- Well, take it, take it.
- Wait a minute.

206
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:59,257
Well, it's all right.  The one who
hinders us will help us.

207
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:11,434
- Ah, this is another matter.
- We'll go for it.  - Well, get ready.

208
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,161
- Go here!
- Go, [ __ ]!

209
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:04,853
Whose shoe?  Mine, thanks.

210
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:10,942
Let's go!

211
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:21,033
Go.  It's already late.

212
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:25,162
Don't get lost?

213
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:32,293
Well, go.

214
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:44,470
- Comrade Shurik?  - Have supper?
- Not.  Alyosha, a bottle of wine.

215
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:49,057
- You're extremely lucky.
- In what?

216
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:52,685
You wanted to see
an ancient, beautiful custom.

217
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:54,228
Of course I dream about it.

218
00:33:54,937 --> 00:33:57,397
- Tomorrow at dawn.
- What are you talking about?

219
00:33:58,022 --> 00:34:01,150
You can not only watch,
you can participate yourself.

220
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,654
- Thank you very much for this.
Do you want juice?  - Not.

221
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:11,826
- What is the name of this ceremony?
- Bride kidnapping.  - Abduction?

222
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:15,954
- No, don't think that the bride herself
dreams of being kidnapped.

223
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:24,044
You can go to the registry office, but before that, the
bride needs to be stolen!  - Steal?

224
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,631
Oh damn, nice custom.
Well, what is my role?

225
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:37,389
- Catch the bride.  Put it in a bag.
- In a bag?  Is this also customary?

226
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:40,641
Brilliant!

227
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:44,602
- And give it to whom?
- To a dzhigit in love.  - Not.

228
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:51,066
- And hand over to the kunaks the
dzhigit in love.  - Ah, kunakam?

229
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,860
- That's the custom.
- Understandably.

230
00:34:54,235 --> 00:34:57,237
By the way, here they are.  I'll
introduce you now.  - With pleasure.

231
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:12,293
- Meet.
- Shurik.

232
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:40,983
They don't speak Russian at all.
But everyone understands.

233
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,828
- What he says?
He says bon appetit.

234
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,604
Bambarbia.  Kergud.

235
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,565
What did he say?

236
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:33,527
He says that if you
refuse, they will kill you.

237
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:39,448
Joke.

238
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:43,785
- It's a joke... I agree.
- Very well.

239
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,830
Nina will be very happy.

240
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:52,293
- So the bride's name is Nina?
- Nina.  My niece.

241
00:36:55,295 --> 00:37:00,883
- Does Nina have a fiancé?
- They adore each other.

242
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:13,143
I completely forgot.

243
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:21,108
Excuse me, I can't
do this.  No way.

244
00:37:26,237 --> 00:37:33,243
Most importantly, Nina asked that you
do it.

245
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:38,164
- Did Nina ask for it herself?  - Highly.

246
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,924
Well, tell
Nina that I agree.

247
00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:58,389
But remember, custom requires
that everything be natural.

248
00:37:58,389 --> 00:37:59,807
Nobody knows anything.

249
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:02,810
The bride will
resist, kick,

250
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,102
even bite, call the police,

251
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:07,355
shout: "I will
complain to the regional committee!" -

252
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:09,273
but you do not pay attention.

253
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:18,447
I understand.  Don't worry.
Everything will be natural.

254
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:40,557
Shurik...

255
00:39:44,935 --> 00:39:46,520
What are you doing, Shurik?

256
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:49,523
Just don't say anything.

257
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:55,111
What's wrong with you, huh?

258
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,114
I have come to say goodbye to you.

259
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:06,078
- Goodbye, Shurik.
- Farewell, Nina.  Be happy.

260
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:09,998
Farewell, farewell.

261
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,734
What are you shipping?

262
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:50,949
The bride was stolen, comrade foreman.

263
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:58,330
Joker!  You will fry the barbecue with this
bride, do not forget to invite.

264
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:50,790
So it wasn't a ritual?
It really was stolen.  - Yes.

265
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:55,419
- Who stole it?  Oh yes... Who is the groom?

266
00:41:56,503 --> 00:42:03,426
- We sometimes learn about it
at the wedding.  - There will be no wedding!

267
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:09,805
I stole it, I will return it!

268
00:42:23,026 --> 00:42:25,319
Comrade Shurik!

269
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:33,367
- What's the matter?  What happened?
- Crime, stolen!  - What was stolen?

270
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:36,495
Was your donkey stolen?
- Girl, Nina.  - Nina?

271
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:39,331
- I'm the only witness.

272
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,960
No, you are not a witness,
you are a kidnapper, a criminal!

273
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,254
Well, I didn't know!

274
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:51,883
What a disgrace, I swear, on my word,
you understand, for the whole district!

275
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:55,427
- I didn't know!
- I'll take care of this myself.

276
00:42:55,761 --> 00:43:00,348
This mysterious groom is an
insignificant scoundrel!  You don't know who it is?

277
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:06,853
- Very sorry.  Scoundrel, scoundrel,
immoral type, simply immoral type!

278
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:11,233
Thank you very much for the signal.  With this
single negative example,

279
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:14,318
we will mobilize the public,
raise the masses... - That's right!

280
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:19,072
- I'll go to the police.  - What
militia, listen?  They arrest you.

281
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,034
They are formally obliged to
imprison you - they will imprison you.

282
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:34,377
- One salvation - to disappear.
I will do everything myself.  Nina will be saved.

283
00:43:34,836 --> 00:43:36,795
We will judge these scoundrels in a
show trial.

284
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:40,966
And you will come to the process
really as a witness.

285
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:46,554
- I have no right to abuse your
nobility.  - What nobility?

286
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:53,016
You risk because of me.  I stole Nina
and I have to redeem myself.

287
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:08,447
Why go to the police?  These sacrifices are not needed.
Directly to the prosecutor.  He will understand everything.

288
00:44:09,406 --> 00:44:14,160
- Dear guests, welcome.
- Tell me, Marim, do you have a prosecutor?

289
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,622
Everything is with us, the whole city is with us, only they
were waiting for you.  Wine dear guests!

290
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:26,003
- No, I dont drink alcohol.  We would like a prosecutor.
- You can't refuse.  Blood insult.

291
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:45,561
District hospital?  Come immediately
to Gogol Street, 47. House of Kapitanaki.

292
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:52,357
Yes, where is the name day.  One of the guests is
really bad.  Please immediately.

293
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:14,168
You understand, this is a very severe form of the
disease.  We need to save a person.

294
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:22,883
On the basis of alcoholism, he has
obsessions.  The stolen bride.

295
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:25,928
He is eager to save someone all the time,

296
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:28,638
just clouding his
mind, honestly.

297
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:32,767
It's clear.  Delirium tremens.  Delirium
tremens.

298
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:35,644
Yes, white, hot, completely white.

299
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:43,150
In 3 days we will put on our feet.  No, there is
no need to hurry.  This is our guest.

300
00:45:43,776 --> 00:45:48,029
It's important to heal.  It is important to return a
full-fledged person to society.

301
00:45:48,905 --> 00:45:51,032
Let's try.

302
00:48:36,044 --> 00:48:39,505
If I were a sultan
I would have three wives

303
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:46,219
And be surrounded by triple beauty.
But on the other hand, in such cases,

304
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:51,306
So many troubles and worries,
Oh, save Allah.

305
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:57,770
It's not bad to have three wives,
But it's very bad on the other hand.

306
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:16,453
It's all right, you can come.

307
00:49:46,478 --> 00:49:49,605
How to be us, the sultans,
Clarity is needed here.

308
00:49:49,938 --> 00:49:53,608
How many wives just right:
three or one?

309
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:57,487
To the question,
there is a simple answer to this:

310
00:49:57,487 --> 00:50:00,697
If I were a sultan
, I would be single.

311
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:09,580
It's not bad at all without a wife,
Much better in every way.

312
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:55,201
Ah well!  OK then.
I'm on a hunger strike!

313
00:50:56,369 --> 00:51:01,289
And now no one but the prosecutor
will enter here!

314
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,834
Look out!

315
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:16,760
Typical delirium tremens.  Rushing
to save some stolen girl,

316
00:51:18,721 --> 00:51:21,000
In general, he behaves as
Comrade Saakhov warned us.

317
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,800
Yes, yes, he called me too.

318
00:51:24,058 --> 00:51:29,062
Now he is in a state of excitement and
demands that you accept him.

319
00:51:29,604 --> 00:51:32,024
Requires - accept.

320
00:51:39,946 --> 00:51:42,574
Be careful.

321
00:52:27,736 --> 00:52:32,074
Comrade Saakhov's diagnosis is
clearly confirmed.

322
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:38,912
- Did you say Saahov?
- Saakhov, Saakhov.

323
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:42,957
So he hid me here?

324
00:52:42,957 --> 00:52:45,834
He did not hide, but directed
at the time of the crisis.

325
00:52:46,502 --> 00:52:49,546
- Acute crisis.

326
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:05,351
So I'll tell you this:
Saakhov stole this girl.

327
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:09,896
That's right, I stole it.  And he buried it in the ground,
and wrote the inscription.

328
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:16,527
Go, go.  We will heal you.
Alcoholics are our profile.

329
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,574
Untie me.

330
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:30,580
- Will you be well behaved?
- Untie.

331
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:37,461
I understand.  You all don't believe me.

332
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:44,800
May I see the prosecutor?
- You can.  Where is our prosecutor?

333
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:49,804
In the 6th ward, where Napoleon used to be.

334
00:53:51,806 --> 00:53:55,726
You may not eat, you may not drink,
you may be silent,

335
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,520
it won't help you anyway.

336
00:53:59,313 --> 00:54:04,025
The best groom in the area offers his
hand and heart.

337
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:11,448
- Service.  - What?  - I got to the service.
- Big service?

338
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:17,703
- 12 persons, 96 items.
- You have no conscience.

339
00:54:20,163 --> 00:54:23,416
You spit on our customs.
What?

340
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:28,754
Silly.  You don't have any other choice.

341
00:54:29,963 --> 00:54:32,256
Are you saying
that you will be looked for?

342
00:54:33,382 --> 00:54:36,427
They will turn to relatives,
and the relative is me.

343
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:42,015
And I will say, she left the institute,
got married and left.

344
00:54:45,017 --> 00:54:47,728
Don't interrupt when someone is talking to you
!

345
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:56,610
So: either you leave there as a wife - oh,
what a groom!  Or you won't come out at all.

346
00:55:10,372 --> 00:55:17,211
This is another matter.  Open the door,
now you will meet the groom.

347
00:55:31,889 --> 00:55:35,101
- Take off your hat.  - What?  - Take off your hat.

348
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:10,797
Listen, it's a shame, I swear it's a shame, I
didn't do anything, I just went in.

349
00:56:12,214 --> 00:56:15,426
- Still young, capricious.
- What a capricious, listen, hooligan!

350
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:24,349
Now I
have only 2 ways out of this house:

351
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:30,605
either I take her to the registry office,
or she takes me to the prosecutor.

352
00:56:31,397 --> 00:56:33,149
- No need.  - I don't want to.

353
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:58,712
Nothing.  In a day she will be hungry,
in a week she will yearn,

354
00:56:59,045 --> 00:57:02,882
and in a month she will become smart.
Nothing, we'll wait.  - Will wait.

355
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:10,763
Remember, comrades.  Finally, you must
justify the trust placed in you.

356
00:57:12,139 --> 00:57:16,352
And you answer for it with your head.
We will try, comrade Jabrail.

357
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:50,296
- Think for three?
- It's a sin to laugh at sick people.

358
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:53,298
Seriously, I'm running, huh?

359
00:57:53,298 --> 00:57:55,968
- You can't run away from here.
- There is one way.

360
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:19,862
Stop, psycho!

361
00:58:26,243 --> 00:58:30,037
What are you running like crazy?
Where is your donkey?

362
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:37,294
- What happened?  Where are you in a hurry?
- There, there.  - Get in, I'll take you.

363
00:58:45,883 --> 00:58:47,969
- Where to take you?
- I'll tell you everything,

364
00:58:47,969 --> 00:58:50,054
and you'll decide where to take me.

365
00:58:50,388 --> 00:58:54,182
Just come quickly.
- The car is a beast, listen.

366
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:05,942
Cursed be the day I got behind the
steering wheel of this vacuum cleaner!

367
00:59:10,905 --> 00:59:13,949
Write from a new line.

368
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:17,035
Lunch, - emphasize,
refused the soup.

369
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:27,668
In brackets - kharcho soup.
- Kharcho...

370
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:37,135
Three servings of shish kebab - thrown
into the abyss.  - Into the abyss.

371
00:59:42,598 --> 00:59:47,518
Broke 2 bottles of wine.

372
00:59:49,395 --> 00:59:54,691
- Three.  - Write three.  - Three bottles...

373
01:00:06,284 --> 01:00:09,995
Fruits - oranges.

374
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:35,183
- Comrade Saakhov's dacha?
- Yeah.  - Sanitary and epidemiological station.

375
01:00:49,444 --> 01:00:50,362
- Who do you want?

376
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:58,202
There is an epidemic in the area.  Head
vaccinations.  FMD!  Sign!

377
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:16,634
- Take off your shirt?
- You don't have to wear shirts.

378
01:01:17,802 --> 01:01:19,970
Lie down on your stomach.

379
01:01:39,069 --> 01:01:44,949
- Calmly.  I don't poke yet.  - A.
Not yet.  Tell me, does it hurt?

380
01:01:45,325 --> 01:01:48,827
- It all depends on the diameter of the needle.
- Tell me, what is your diameter...

381
01:02:02,297 --> 01:02:06,842
- Alcohol?  - Alcohol.

382
01:02:55,841 --> 01:03:01,680
Lie down without moving.  This is the latest
slow digestion vaccine.

383
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:07,101
- Is there no one else in the house?
- No, there is no one.

384
01:03:07,434 --> 01:03:11,479
Calm down.
Otherwise - "memento sea".

385
01:03:12,313 --> 01:03:16,734
- Instantly...
- At sea!

386
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:25,449
Nina is here, I'm sure.
Find and warn her.

387
01:03:25,783 --> 01:03:30,579
- When will they sleep?
- After half an hour.  Go, go.

388
01:03:46,134 --> 01:03:52,972
The filterable FMD virus
develops particularly rapidly in the body...

389
01:03:53,973 --> 01:03:59,060
- In short, Sklikhasovsky!
- You're not interested, don't bother.

390
01:04:00,896 --> 01:04:03,940
It develops especially rapidly
in an organism

391
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,984
weakened by nicotine, alcohol and...

392
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:13,489
- ...bad excesses.

393
01:04:18,118 --> 01:04:25,458
Nina, Nina, where are you?

394
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:31,755
Quiet.  Go there.

395
01:12:19,685 --> 01:12:23,855
Nina, Nina... What's wrong with you?

396
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:29,110
Nina, are you alive?

397
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:37,826
Thank God!  Thank God!
- For what?

398
01:12:38,867 --> 01:12:43,831
Traitor, vile mercenary...
Judas!  Scoundrel!  How much were you paid?

399
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:46,582
Untie me!

400
01:12:52,254 --> 01:12:54,881
Insignificance, venal skin.

401
01:12:56,424 --> 01:13:01,095
Let me go!  Bandit, trash, stupid,

402
01:13:02,053 --> 01:13:08,684
chameleon, scoundrel!  Alcoholic,
unfortunate folklorist!

403
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:48,092
Hello, I'm listening.
Speak, well!

404
01:14:31,294 --> 01:14:34,464
Who's here?

405
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:28,842
Hello ...

406
01:15:51,236 --> 01:15:53,863
I did not expect your arrival at all.  Such a
surprise for me.

407
01:15:56,323 --> 01:16:02,829
Sorry, I'll change.
- Do not worry.  Change clothes in the morgue.

408
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:23,054
We have come to judge you according to the law of the mountains.

409
01:16:23,429 --> 01:16:31,269
Because you wanted to disgrace our kind,
you will die like a vile jackal.

410
01:16:33,146 --> 01:16:35,689
You have no right!
You will be responsible for it!

411
01:16:36,899 --> 01:16:41,694
For your filthy skin, I will answer
only to my conscience as a horseman...

412
01:16:42,737 --> 01:16:46,698
...the honor of my sister and the memory of my ancestors.

413
01:16:47,324 --> 01:16:49,618
Nina, stop them.
We are modern people.

414
01:16:50,035 --> 01:16:52,661
This is medieval savagery.
Well, I broke that code,

415
01:16:52,953 --> 01:16:56,248
but I'm willing to admit my mistakes.

416
01:17:01,878 --> 01:17:10,134
Mistakes must not be recognized,
they must be washed away with blood.

417
01:17:11,636 --> 01:17:13,679
You have no right!

418
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:22,269
This is self-judgment!  I demand that I be
tried according to our Soviet laws.

419
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:25,648
Did you buy it according to Soviet laws?

420
01:17:25,648 --> 01:17:28,733
Or, according to Soviet
laws, did you steal it?

421
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:33,987
Let's stop this useless discussion.
Sister, turn up the TV louder.

422
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:43,121
Don't, I beg you, don't.
I won't do it again!  I swear to you,

423
01:17:43,621 --> 01:17:49,042
I won't do it again.  Well, let me
go to the prosecutor's office.

424
01:17:49,418 --> 01:17:53,671
Well, let me turn myself in to the authorities.

425
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,015
Ah, Hamlet, well done, listen.

426
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,477
- Are you out of your mind?
- Don't worry, it's just salt.

427
01:18:14,605 --> 01:18:17,357
Get up!  Judgment is coming!

428
01:18:20,152 --> 01:18:24,530
Long live our court - the most
humane court in the world!

429
01:18:29,576 --> 01:18:31,536
Please sit down.

430
01:18:39,459 --> 01:18:42,420
- Sit down.
Thanks, I'll stand.

431
01:18:43,755 --> 01:18:47,966
Citizen Judge, but he can't sit down.

432
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:24,663
Following the spring shower
Before the dawn will come

433
01:19:24,997 --> 01:19:29,709
And for two happy
Many, many years.

434
01:19:30,335 --> 01:19:34,004
Lightnings will sparkle,
Streams will ring,

435
01:19:34,588 --> 01:19:38,883
Fog will swirl,
White as a bear.
