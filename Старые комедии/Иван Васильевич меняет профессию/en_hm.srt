Long live our father, our tsar!

19
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,469
Glory!

20
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,745
Damn!

21
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,627
Hey, what's the matter?
No electricity again!

22
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,840
It's outrageous!
Timofeyev has burned the fuses again!

23
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:27,938
- Comrade Timofeyev, when will it end?
- I'm finishing.

24
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:31,031
When will be the end
of your experiments

25
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,812
which leave our whole building
without electricity?

26
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,438
There you go.

27
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:40,194
Ivan Vassilyevich, if you knew
what an important invention

28
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:42,906
I'm working on, you wouldn't have
said that.

29
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,201
Experiments with electricity
should be done at your office,

30
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:51,333
and at home electricity must be used
only for peaceful, domestic purposes!

31
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,585
How many times did I tell you...

32
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:58,118
I'm on leave, so I work at home.
And anyway, my experiments are safe.

33
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:01,219
As the public representative,
I demand that you stop it!

34
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:05,308
Today you've burned the fuses,
tomorrow you'll burn the house!

35
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:07,977
STUPID

36
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,606
And what is this?

37
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:12,900
You see?
That's the result. Pah!

38
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:18,616
I'll need to raise the voltage.

39
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,830
Dangerous! Of course, it's dangerous,
but, as they say, nothing ventured...

40
00:06:07,0007 --> 00:06:12,681
Your only love
is not so easily found.

41
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:18,688
Our planet's turning,
round and round.

42
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:24,922
The planet's flying
in everyday beat.

43
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:31,537
It's very hard
to fall in love on it.

44
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:36,668
A winter blizzard is raging,

45
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:39,629
And thunderstorms are blazing,

46
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:45,386
And stars in the sky are racing,
and cities din in the rain.

47
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:48,598
And people don't see each other,

48
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,727
They just pass by each other,

49
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,055
They always lose each other,

50
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:59,445
Never to find again.

51
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:06,245
But there's somewhere
my only love,

52
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,914
My unforgettable,

53
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,585
My true big love.

54
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:15,965
I look for it,

55
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,719
But in everyday beat

56
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:24,475
It's hard for us to meet.

57
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:30,315
A winter blizzard is raging,

58
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:33,402
And thunderstorms are blazing,

59
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:35,989
And stars in the sky are racing,

60
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,618
And cities din in the rain.

61
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,747
And people don't see each other,

62
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,834
They just pass by each other,

63
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,629
They always lose each other,

64
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:54,552
Never to find again.

65
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:57,890
Never to find again.

66
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,459
I can imagine what's going to happen!

67
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,878
I hope we can avoid a scandal!

68
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,965
Those scandals are so tiresome.

69
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,801
I was divorced three times.

70
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:32,807
Yes, that's right, three times.
Zyuzin doesn't count.

71
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:35,686
I've never been as nervous as today.

72
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:39,899
Well, I'm going to do it!

73
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,236
Oh, Shurik!

74
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:46,532
Your apparatus is going to kill you!

75
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,871
My apparatus, Zinochka, will make me
famous. And you, too.

76
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:52,539
Really?

77
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,129
I'm sorry to bother you,

78
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,467
but I have terrible news for you.

79
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,0007
My gloves have been stolen from me
today.

80
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:11,342
And I fell in love with another man.
Do you understand, Shurik?

81
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:16,016
- Yes, your gloves. What about them?
- Forget the gloves. I love another man.

82
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,989
Well, it's done!

83
00:09:19,197 --> 00:09:21,866
Only, please, no objections,
and don't make scenes!

84
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,454
What?
Are you asking who is the man?

85
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:30,030
You probably think it's Molchanovsky?
No, you're wrong.

86
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,837
Zupperman?
Wrong again.

87
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:35,758
All right!
Let's not beat about the bushes.

88
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:39,179
He is... film director Yakin.

89
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:42,223
Well, well, well.

90
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:49,441
It's strange though. It happens
for the first time in my life.

91
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:54,054
The man is told that his wife is
leaving him, and he says, well, well.

92
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:56,824
At the very least, it's impolite.

93
00:09:57,116 --> 00:10:00,746
You mean that tall, blond man?

94
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:05,417
Unbelievable! To show so little
interest in his own wife!

95
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:09,632
The blond one is Molchanovsky.
Can't you remember it? Molchanovsky.

96
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:13,637
And Yakin is...
Yakin is very talented!

97
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:17,017
What? You ask
where we're going to live?

98
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,669
Today we're leaving for Gagry
to look for the film's location.

99
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:27,027
And later, he will be given a flat.
Of course, if he's not lying.

100
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,916
Sure, he is lying!

101
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,033
Oh, all this is so ridiculous!

102
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,873
To insult a man because you're
jealous!

103
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,501
He can't be lying every minute!

104
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:45,045
During my many sleepless nights,
I've been thinking,

105
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:50,515
and I came to the conclusion
that we're no match for each other.

106
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:55,479
Can't you understand, Alexander, that
I live in the world of cinema, of art!

107
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,445
But your calmness
just amazes me!

108
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:07,535
You know, Shurik, I even feel like
making a scene.

109
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:10,664
- No, don't do it.
- You think so?

110
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:12,583
- I'm sure.
- A-ha.

111
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:16,546
Goodbye, Shurik.

112
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:25,265
But don't cancel my house registration.
Who knows what might happen.

113
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:32,105
Alexander Sergeyevich!

114
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,609
Please, tell Zinaida Mikhailovna
that Rozalia Frantsevna said

115
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:38,364
that Kapitolina Nikiforovna offered
Anna Ivanovna a fur coat...

116
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,451
Zinaida Mikhailovna has left.

117
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,703
- Where for?
- With her lover.

118
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,291
What do you mean, with her lover?
And you're so calm about it?

119
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,671
- You're a very strange man.
- Excuse me, I'm very busy.

120
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,384
You are some character!

121
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:59,180
If I were your wife,
I would have left, too.

122
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:03,0003
If you were my wife,
I would have hanged myself.

123
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:06,522
You jerk!

124
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:11,011
Is that the dental clinic?
Hallo?

125
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,448
Extension 3-62?

126
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:23,209
May I speak to Anton Shpak, please?

127
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,297
Anton, that's for you.

128
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:30,844
- Who's calling?
- A woman.

129
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:33,430
Keep your mouth open.

130
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:35,891
Speaking.

131
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:41,303
Anton Semyonovich? Hello.
At what time do you finish today?

132
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:48,197
I'm an actress. No, you don't know me,
but I'm dying to meet you.

133
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:59,252
So you work until four?
I'll call again, I'm very persistent.

134
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:01,254
I'm looking forward to it!

135
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,553
Well, let's continue.

136
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:24,157
A.S. Shpak

137
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,767
How lucky for me to drop by!

138
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:25,148
Folks, keep your money in a bank!

139
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,566
Naturally, if you have it!

140
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,820
What do you care about my relations
with my wife?

141
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:34,659
It's none of your business whether
we're divorcing or not.

142
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:37,454
That's our personal matter.

143
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:42,293
No, that's a public matter. Your
divorces lower our indices.

144
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:46,882
- What do You want from me?
- Wait until the end of the quarter.

145
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:49,593
Then you may divorce as much
as you like.

146
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:54,404
When you're talking, Ivan
Vassilyevich, it looks like a raving.

147
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,895
What do you mean?

148
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,730
And about your suspicious machine.

149
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,693
I'm asking you to file an application.

150
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:05,821
Do it, or we'll file a complaint.

151
00:15:06,0006 --> 00:15:10,536
Wait. Wait! There's nothing
suspicious about my apparatus.

152
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,372
I simply invented
a time machine.

153
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:17,752
In other words, I can run through
space and go back to the past.

154
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,254
- Go back to the past?
- Yes, to the past.

155
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:22,507
These experiments, Alexander,

156
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:26,263
can be done only by permission
of the appropriate authorities.

157
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:30,268
Wait, Ivan Vassilyevich.
This apparatus can be very useful.

158
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,032
Let me explain.

159
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:35,649
That's it!

160
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:09,394
And now we're going to test
the time machine.

161
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:12,515
You're witnessing
a historic event.

162
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,978
First, we'll try a close distance.

163
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:20,817
Look,
we're going to run through space.

164
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:05,0005
- Did You see it?
- What?

165
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,581
- You see?
- What is it?

166
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:10,418
What happened?

167
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:14,215
Alexander Sergeyevich,
where is the wall?

168
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:18,018
What is it? What's going on?
There was a wall here!

169
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:23,622
Timofeyev, you will answer for it
in court. Inventing such a machine!

170
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,687
Go to hell
with your wall!

171
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,784
- Half a flat has vanished.
- No big deal.

172
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:31,568
What do you mean, no big deal?

173
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:49,591
I've seen some technical wonders,
but nothing like that.

174
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:57,141
- Excuse me, and who are you?
- Are you asking who I am?

175
00:18:57,057 --> 00:19:01,956
- I'm a friend of Anton Shpak.
- And what are you doing in his flat?

176
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:02,480
What am I doing?

177
00:19:02,0002 --> 00:19:04,770
I'm waiting for my friend.

178
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:07,904
And how did you get into his flat
if he's not here?

179
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:11,011
Oh, go to hell!
What kind of questions are those?

180
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:19,209
Never mind. I've gone through time.
I've made it!

181
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,547
Tell me, can you lift
any wall like that?

182
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:24,024
A wall?!

183
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:26,259
Your invention is invaluable.

184
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:28,554
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

185
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:35,035
Why are you staring at me? There're
no pictures, nor flowers growing on me.

186
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:40,485
You're wearing the same imported
suede jacket as Shpak does.

187
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:43,698
Really?
Ajacket? A suede jacket?

188
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:47,910
Is Shpak the only one in Moscow
who has a suede jacket?

189
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:50,163
What is your name?

190
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,170
I'm an artiste of all big and small
academic theatres.

191
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:59,744
And my name is too famous
to pronounce it.

192
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:04,139
Do you want to get back to Shpak's
room? I can open the wall for you.

193
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:06,432
I'd better take a look at your
machine.

194
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:09,561
- I like it.
- I'm very glad!

195
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:12,012
You're my first witness.

196
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:15,277
It's my first time
being a witness.

197
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:19,907
Why are you staring? You're going to
rub a hole through me with your eyes.

198
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:23,328
Do you realize
what you have just seen?

199
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:25,622
You bet! But tell me...

200
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:31,463
Can you lift a wall like that
in a store?

201
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:35,718
- My, what a useful invention!
- You came to Shapk's with a recorder?

202
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,038
Forget the wall.

203
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:42,559
The most important thing is that
through walls I can pierce space.

204
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:47,900
I can enter time.
I can go 200, 300 years back!

205
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:52,529
You have ignored my question
about the tape recorder.

206
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:54,782
Darn you!

207
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:58,938
What a machine! A breakthrough in
science and technology! Darn you again!

208
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:04,419
I can't wait!
Let's go back into the past

209
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:07,0007
and see the ancient Moscow!

210
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:10,760
What are you saying, Timofeyev?

211
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:14,222
Before seeing the ancient Moscow,
get a permission from the authorities!

212
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:15,891
Just a minute!

213
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:20,898
If you mess again with the academic's
tests and stop technological progress...

214
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:24,109
- I'm going to...
- Calm down! Calm down! I got it.

215
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:25,861
Do it.

216
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:31,118
- I'm so nervous.
- Don't chicken! I'm here!

217
00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:22,722
...to the heavenly abode...

218
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:25,367
...to the Reverend Father Superior,
Kuzma...

219
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,521
Kuzma...

220
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:31,941
the Tsar and Grand Duke of all Russia...

221
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:35,529
Of all Russia...

222
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,491
is bowing low.

223
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:45,999
Go on writing.

224
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:51,882
Look!
That's Ivan the Terrible!

225
00:22:52,298 --> 00:22:54,054
You're kidding!

226
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:03,479
Mamma mia!

227
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:12,906
The demons!
The demons!

228
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:15,201
The demons!

229
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:19,832
Away!
Stay away!

230
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:26,673
Woe is me, the sinner!
Woe is me, cursed murderer!

231
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:28,884
The evil spirit!

232
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:32,931
- Wait! Where are you going? Wait!
- Go away, vanish, evil spirit!

233
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:51,453
- Who are You calling?
- The police.

234
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:56,543
- Put down the phone.
- What? What do you mean?

235
00:23:56,792 --> 00:24:00,297
- The phone! Put down the phone!
- Why? I won't!

236
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:02,925
Put down the phone, I say!

237
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:05,179
- Easy! Easy!
- I'll crush you, big hat!

238
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:07,555
Where are the demons?

239
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:19,570
Get them!

240
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,211
Wait! Wait!

241
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,248
They've bricked me up!
They've bricked me up, the demons!

242
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,674
That's what the life-giving cross
can do!

243
00:26:08,0008 --> 00:26:09,827
And where's the tsar?

244
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,418
You shouldn't drink so much.

245
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:31,729
Where are they?

246
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:35,035
Hurry! Move it!

247
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:53,171
Why are they yelling?

248
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:56,133
They cannot yell.
They're all dead.

249
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:05,185
See how those dead can shoot?

250
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:08,148
- Open up, dog!
- Whom is he addressing?

251
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:10,752
- You.
- Me?!

252
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,653
Oh, I feel so bad!
Bespeak again, aren't you a demon?

253
00:27:46,902 --> 00:27:49,781
I told you already.
I'm not a demon!

254
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,910
Don't dare lying to me!
You're lying to a tsar!

255
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:56,999
Not by human wish, but by God's will,
am I the tsar!

256
00:27:57,249 --> 00:28:00,126
Very well!
I see that you're a tsar...

257
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:04,549
Alas, alas, I'm the tsar
Ivan Vassilyevich!

258
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:08,179
Send me back, magician!

259
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:11,808
I cannot! You see,
because of this pole-axe!

260
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:16,313
Thank you!
The transistors have burned,

261
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:19,984
so I cannot send you back
until I buy the new ones.

262
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:24,782
- Buy them, then.
- The stores are closed for lunch.

263
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:27,911
Oh, woe is me!

264
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:31,469
- Take it easy, Ivan Vassilyevich!
- Oh, woe is me!

265
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:38,312
- do You drink vodka?
- Yes, the anise one!

266
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:38,924
Good.

267
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,042
Unfortunately, there's no anise vodka.

268
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:49,311
I say, there's no anise vodka,
only Stolichnaya!

269
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:53,441
Drink it!

270
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,196
- Taste it from My cup.
- Why?

271
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:59,115
Go on, taste it...

272
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,505
You think I want to poison you?

273
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:06,122
We don't do that any more,

274
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:09,544
and in our day, you'd sooner get
poisoned with canned food, than vodka.

275
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:11,011
Don't be afraid, drink up!

276
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,218
- Let you be healthy, Boyar!
- Your health!

277
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:24,479
- Was it your housekeeper Who made it?
- Let's suppose so. Eat something!

278
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:37,619
- Who made this machine? You?
- Yes.

279
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:41,708
I had a man like you.
He made wings.

280
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,543
- Well?
- What do you mean, well?

281
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:47,047
I put him on a gun-powder barrel.
It made him fly! Ha-ha!

282
00:29:47,797 --> 00:29:49,633
Why did you do it?

283
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:52,929
No, no. I don't drink. I don't drink,
Ivan Vassilyevich. Thank you.

284
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:55,474
- Don't you have any respect for me?
- For God's sake, Ivan Vassilyevich!

285
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:59,229
- Then drink.
- Just a little. Enough! Enough!

286
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,615
- Well, be healthy!
- Your health!

287
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,013
So, you live here?

288
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:17,418
- Well, very cramped quarters.
- Sure, it's not like tsar's chambers.

289
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:20,920
- Yes, that's right.
- Anyway, it's an individual flat.

290
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:24,024
And your woman,
is she at church?

291
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:29,029
My woman eloped today with
her lover, Yakin, to the Caucasus.

292
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,725
You are kidding?!
Did you send men to catch them?

293
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:36,732
When they catch them, first thing
have Yakin impaled, and then...

294
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:39,903
Why?
They're in love with each other.

295
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:43,323
I wish them every happiness.

296
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:50,874
How kind you are!

297
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,668
Oh, God! What's going on?

298
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:57,590
I sit here, while the Swedes
are taking Kem there.

299
00:30:57,841 --> 00:31:00,886
Send me back, Boyar.

300
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:04,598
Go and buy those transistors.

301
00:31:05,391 --> 00:31:06,727
Just a minute.

302
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:13,931
I'm busy.
Call me later.

303
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:17,154
- I'm going with you.
- Right onto the street?

304
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:20,118
No, Ivan Vassilyevich,
wait for me here.

305
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:23,580
Hurry up, though, Boyar!

306
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:27,027
I'm in a hurry myself.
I must rescue those two, as well.

307
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:29,462
What's going to happen to them?

308
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:32,841
- They'll be beheaded, that's all.
- That's all?

309
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:35,386
To hell with them!

310
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:47,192
Take the demons alive!

311
00:32:58,058 --> 00:32:59,487
Wait!

312
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:51,051
Eureka!

313
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:54,416
The tsar's garb!

314
00:34:55,055 --> 00:34:58,714
Put them on.
You'll be the tsar!

315
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:00,507
No way!

316
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:03,261
Put them on, or I'll kill you!

317
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:17,475
Talk to me, my dear guitar,

318
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:20,395
My friend of seven strings.

319
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,274
All my heart is open ajar,

320
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:28,154
And the night with moonlight sings.

321
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,494
Well, once,
then another time,

322
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:36,956
And again many, many, many times.

323
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:42,458
Yes, once and again, and again
many, many times.

324
00:36:43,923 --> 00:36:50,348
Blue cornflowers in the field,
A long path lies ahead.

325
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:57,982
My heart is torn between the guilt
And the stars unread.

326
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:01,862
Well, once, then another time,

327
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:06,491
And again many, many, many times.

328
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:12,500
Yes, once and again, and again
many, many times.

329
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:17,171
- Well, how do I look?
- Not like him! You're a fake!

330
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:21,302
Let me tie up your teeth at least.
You're a pain in the neck!

331
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:29,561
- the other tsar looks smarter.
- Don't get personal, please!

332
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,795
Sit down!
Occupy yourself with matters of state.

333
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:37,906
Take the stick.

334
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:40,449
- Go ahead, dictate.
- Dictate what?

335
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:43,370
The tsar, repeat it,
of all Russia...

336
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,623
The tsar, repeat it,
of all Russia...

337
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:48,334
Don't repeat ''repeat it''!
Quiet!

338
00:37:52,877 --> 00:37:57,836
So you say:
''The tsar and Grand Duke...''

339
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:00,848
I wrote it, comma.

340
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:04,186
Where the hell
is our secretary?

341
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:07,524
What's up, comrades?

342
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:12,514
I'm asking you,
what's up?

343
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:23,023
Who's that parasite who dared to
break the door in the tsar's quarters?

344
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:26,796
Did they put it here
for you to break it?

345
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:35,974
Go on, Your Majesty!
''...is bowing low...'', semicolon.

346
00:38:38,144 --> 00:38:41,148
I'm waiting for the answer
to my question!

347
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:46,362
The tsar! The tsar's here!
He's here!

348
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:49,533
The tsar's here!

349
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,577
Sit!

350
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:54,915
Where else can he be?
The tsar's in his place!

351
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,126
Have mercy, don't put me to death,
our kind sire!

352
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,257
The demons grabbed you,
we chased them all over the palace!

353
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,886
And, suddenly, the demons vanished!

354
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,010
They were there, we don't deny it.
But they self-destructed.

355
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:14,014
Please, stop this ridiculous panic!
Who are you?

356
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,019
I'm Theophanes, a clerk
at the foreign office.

357
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,822
All right, Fedya.
You may stay here.

358
00:39:22,022 --> 00:39:26,494
The rest, please, leave the tsar's
office. In other words, out!

359
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:29,497
Bark at them!

360
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:31,541
Out!

361
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:39,925
Have mercy, Sire!

362
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:43,472
Stop your somersaults! You did it
once, you did it twice. It's enough.

363
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:47,937
What's the matter with you, Sire?

364
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:53,443
Have you taken ill?

365
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,366
Don't sit like a dummy!
I can't work here all alone!

366
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:01,118
I've got a toothache.

367
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:03,579
He's got periostitis, a gumboil.

368
00:40:04,206 --> 00:40:06,333
- And you stop pestering the tsar!
- Yes, sir.

369
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:10,172
Fedya, enough of your bowing! Are
you going to fall like that all night?

370
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:16,016
- Nice to meet You.
- Don't be angry, Boyar...

371
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:19,599
but I don't recognize you.
Are you a prince?

372
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:23,436
Me? Well, I might be.
What so strange about it?

373
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,818
How do you happen to be in the tsar's
quarters? You weren't here before.

374
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:34,408
- Oh, Sire, who is he?
- He's a friend of Anton Shpak's.

375
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:36,536
What a fool!

376
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:43,646
The tsar says that I'm Prince
Miloslavsky. Are you satisfied?

377
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:47,340
- Oh my! Stay away!
- What's the matter? What is it?

378
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:51,388
- You've been executed!
- That's news to me!

379
00:40:52,305 --> 00:40:57,895
By the tsar's order, you were hanged
on your own gate three days ago.

380
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:09,585
Well, thanks!
I was hanged by your order.

381
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:11,202
Help me out, or we'll screw it.

382
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,998
Why don't you say something, bastard?

383
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:18,018
Oh, now I remember!
It was not I who was hanged.

384
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:20,715
What was his first name, the one
whom they hanged?

385
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:24,344
- Vanka the Robber.
- You see? And I'm George.

386
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:28,028
That bandit was just my namesake.
Am I right?

387
00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:30,559
Am I right?

388
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:32,520
Please...

389
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:37,777
Why are they shouting there?
Fedya, go and find out.

390
00:41:37,944 --> 00:41:39,279
Yes, sir.

391
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:45,494
The tsar!
The tsar!

392
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:50,459
Go! Go! Score! Score!

393
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:55,055
The common people wish to see their
tsar who was saved. They're rejoicing.

394
00:41:55,298 --> 00:41:57,384
Oh, no, it's out of the question.

395
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,680
We have no time for that.
We'll rejoice later.

396
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:07,145
They have to be sent away at once,
understand?

397
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:11,192
Still wouldn't say anything, damn him!

398
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:17,783
- Fedya, I hope there's no war going?
- Of course, there is, my benefactor.

399
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:22,588
The Swedes are biting us, the Khan of
Crimea plays nasty on Izyum Road.

400
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,024
- You don't say!
- Yes.

401
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,211
- Why do You Let them?
- Have mercy, Sire!

402
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,843
Get up, Fyodor.

403
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:36,388
I don't blame you...
Sit down.

404
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:39,976
Write down the tsar's edict.

405
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,481
I order
to send an army

406
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,112
to Izyum Road
and rout the Khan of Crimea.

407
00:42:49,863 --> 00:42:52,575
- Period.
- Period.

408
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:59,790
Sign it, our great tsar.

409
00:43:00,0000 --> 00:43:04,165
I have no right to sign
historic documents.

410
00:43:10,138 --> 00:43:12,682
No, I have no right to sign...

411
00:43:20,149 --> 00:43:24,989
Acting for the tsar, I. Bunsha.

412
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,575
Here, Fedya.

413
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:30,537
And tell them
not to hurry back.

414
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:34,167
Tell them to capture Kazan on their
way back, not to go there twice.

415
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:41,671
How come? Kazan is ours.
We've taken it long ago.

416
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:40,965
- Really?
- Sure.

417
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:44,220
You were too hasty to do it.
All right, all right, then.

418
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,183
Since it's already taken, let it be.
Why give it back?

419
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:55,860
Well, go!

420
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:00,907
And in five minutes I don't want to
see either hide or hair of them here!

421
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:08,124
Mount your horses!

422
00:44:09,0009 --> 00:44:10,461
Start a song!

423
00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:22,391
Early in the spring,
By a fir-tree all green,

424
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:25,510
Vanyusha's bidding farewell to his
love.

425
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:30,108
Clad in a shirt of mail,
He's saying to his gal:

426
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:33,139
''Don't cry, Marusya, don't cry,
my dove.''

427
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:38,038
Marusya says nothing, only weeps,

428
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:39,871
Her sorrow

429
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:42,540
Holds her heart in grips.

430
00:44:42,874 --> 00:44:47,796
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

431
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:50,801
Drop the tears right onto his spear.

432
00:44:51,134 --> 00:44:54,764
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

433
00:44:55,055 --> 00:44:58,768
Drop a sea of tears,

434
00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:01,438
Drop-drop-drop
Right onto his spear.

435
00:45:04,765 --> 00:45:07,683
In winter, cold 'n' severe,
Again under the fir-tree,

436
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:11,851
Vanyusha's being greeted by his love.

437
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:16,790
Clad in a shirt of mail,
He's saying to his gal:

438
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:20,502
''I've come to you, I'm back, my dove.''

439
00:45:20,878 --> 00:45:24,674
Marusya is so happy, she weeps,

440
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:28,554
Like a psaltery,
Herjoyful heartjust sweeps.

441
00:45:29,556 --> 00:45:33,268
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

442
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,397
Drop the tears right onto his spear.

443
00:45:37,523 --> 00:45:41,152
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

444
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:43,948
drop so sweet a tear...

445
00:45:44,364 --> 00:45:45,700
Drop, drop

446
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:48,286
Right onto his spear.

447
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,173
Drop, drop, drop!

448
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:08,518
Marusya is so happy, she weeps

449
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:12,900
Like a psaltery,
Herjoyful heartjust sweeps.

450
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:15,527
Well, we got things going!

451
00:46:16,194 --> 00:46:19,407
Why doesn't the inventor turn
his time machine back?

452
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:23,328
- What a scandal awaits me at home!
- Why?

453
00:46:23,023 --> 00:46:29,029
- I didn't tell Ulyuana where I went.
- Oh, yes, of course.

454
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:32,631
We couldn't care less,
We couldn't care less,

455
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:36,427
Though owls and wolves
Make us real wuss...

456
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:42,518
Alexander Sergeyevich! I'm sorry
to bother you during a family crisis.

457
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:46,981
Did Ivan Vassilyevich drop by?
They're looking for him everywhere.

458
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:51,320
We couldn't care less...
We firmly believe...

459
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,584
CLOSED FOR INVENTORY

460
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,348
CLOSED FOR REDECORATION

461
00:47:55,356 --> 00:47:57,357
What a scoundrel!

462
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:03,656
I shouldn't have confessed
to this saintly man!

463
00:48:06,0006 --> 00:48:08,798
Shurik, are you home?

464
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,543
Shurik!

465
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:24,475
Shurik!

466
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,455
What is that?

467
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:53,216
Oh, I've taken the bag of that
bastard, Yakin.

468
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:55,055
FILM STUDIO

469
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:01,852
First, this hysterical woman
made a scene on the set,

470
00:49:04,146 --> 00:49:07,984
and then she mixed up our suitcases.
All this just an hour before our plane!

471
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,488
Karp Savelyevich!
I can't believe how lucky I am.

472
00:49:23,298 --> 00:49:26,667
Wait for me and I'll be back.

473
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:40,040
Hello? Anyuta, you won't believe it!

474
00:49:40,273 --> 00:49:43,360
I'm flying to Gagry
with Yakin.

475
00:49:44,236 --> 00:49:47,490
Zinaida Mikhailovna, I think
you realize

476
00:49:47,991 --> 00:49:51,913
that it's all over between us
after what you've done at the studio.

477
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:56,056
Karp Savelyevich,
you're a scoundrel!

478
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:58,545
Please, return my bag, and here's
yours.

479
00:49:59,714 --> 00:50:02,633
- I hope that all My things are in it?
- What?

480
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:08,599
Oh, you bastard! You jerk!

481
00:50:08,514 --> 00:50:12,746
I left my husband, that saintly man
with all the accommodations,

482
00:50:14,273 --> 00:50:16,400
a genius, an inventor,

483
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:18,944
for this scoundrel...

484
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:22,157
My goodness, such brilliant lines!

485
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:24,786
You haven't heard real lines yet!

486
00:50:25,286 --> 00:50:27,455
And two hours before our leaving,

487
00:50:27,746 --> 00:50:31,293
I find him with some witch,

488
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:34,923
whom he's holding by her hand,

489
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:40,304
and behaving
like a two-bitjerk.

490
00:50:40,595 --> 00:50:42,598
We were rehearsing a scene.

491
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:47,188
This is my professional duty.
Profession de foi.

492
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,815
Enough! I'm fed up!

493
00:50:50,816 --> 00:50:52,777
I'm leaving you

494
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:57,283
for director Budimir Kosoy
and his production of ''Boris Godunov''.

495
00:50:57,533 --> 00:51:00,0000
Kosoy is a fake.

496
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:04,749
And you're a failure!
For him, I'm going to play a tsarina.

497
00:51:05,0005 --> 00:51:08,547
Kosoy hasn't yet found anyone
for the part of Ivan the Terrible.

498
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:11,382
What?
No Ivan the Terrible?

499
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:16,402
- But I've already rehearsed with him!
- Where?

500
00:51:16,016 --> 00:51:19,518
Here!
Right in this room!

501
00:51:19,216 --> 00:51:25,025
And who's playing Tsar Boris?
Who?

502
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:25,567
What Tsar Boris?

503
00:51:26,692 --> 00:51:29,738
- Boriska?
- What is it?

504
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:33,826
- Boriska is to become a tsar?
- What? Are you really rehearsing?

505
00:51:34,452 --> 00:51:38,582
That's how he, sly fox, is paying
for the good I've done him?

506
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:42,378
He wants to be a tsar
and take all tsardom in his hand!

507
00:51:42,628 --> 00:51:45,045
Death, that's what he deserves!

508
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:49,971
Oh, my God, what a character!
Bravo! Bravo!

509
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:53,308
Please, go on!

510
00:51:54,434 --> 00:51:57,730
Why did you hurt this Boyar woman,
you lowly man?

511
00:51:58,058 --> 00:52:01,986
It's great! It's amazing!
He's a genius!

512
00:52:02,236 --> 00:52:06,0006
Listen, I can't recognize you in your
makeup. Who are you?

513
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,0009
Sergey Bondarchuk?
No.

514
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,124
Oh, you're Yuri Nikulin!
No, no, no.

515
00:52:16,586 --> 00:52:18,255
Oh, my God!

516
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,023
Innokenty Smoktunovsky!

517
00:52:24,513 --> 00:52:25,848
Kesha!

518
00:52:29,143 --> 00:52:31,146
Why didn't you tell me?

519
00:52:31,396 --> 00:52:35,734
- You vagabond, you vile shrimp!
- Are you crazy?

520
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:39,280
There, get it,
son of a bitch!

521
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,701
Oh, my God!

522
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,622
You scoundrel! Son of a bitch!
Damned adulterer!

523
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,209
He is a real tsar!

524
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:54,507
Help! Somebody! Call the police!

525
00:52:54,695 --> 00:52:57,400
On your knees, you worm!

526
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:01,932
I've caught you, Yakin! Adulterer
and son of a bitch!

527
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:06,855
Pray, son of a bitch!
This is your last prayer!

528
00:53:07,398 --> 00:53:11,652
- Oh, you're rehearsing?
- Yes, we're rehearsing.

529
00:53:13,013 --> 00:53:19,336
What do you mean, rehearsing?
Call the police!

530
00:53:17,284 --> 00:53:20,580
- Where are You going?
- I'm here. I'm here.

531
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:23,124
You act very well!

532
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:26,545
And the tsar looks very authentic...

533
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:30,550
He looks just like Bunsha.

534
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:37,558
I've been robbed, Zinaida Mikhailovna.
I'm waiting for the police with dogs.

535
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,573
Who do you belong to?

536
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:44,358
Excuse me, comrade actor,
but what do you mean, ''belong''?

537
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,487
- Whose serf are You?
- Sorry, but I don't understand you.

538
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:50,824
A very stupid serf!

539
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:54,703
Excuse me, but why do you keep
calling me a serf?

540
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:58,058
- Where Did You get that word?
- It's from the part he's playing.

541
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:01,629
That part is denigrating!
Please, don't apply it to me!

542
00:54:02,0002 --> 00:54:05,884
Oh, God! Some apartment house!
They rob you, they call you names!

543
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:09,263
We'll never win the honorary title of
a house of cultured communal living.

544
00:54:09,806 --> 00:54:12,012
This is an outrage! An outrage!

545
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,316
Well, lascivious shrimp, beg the Boyar
woman if she giveth you life or death!

546
00:54:17,189 --> 00:54:20,402
- Life.
- Life. Life.

547
00:54:20,652 --> 00:54:22,655
Be merciful, O great tsar!

548
00:54:23,023 --> 00:54:24,407
Life?

549
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:29,538
Be it your way.

550
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:39,039
Listen to me, Karp,
but, please, don't get excited.

551
00:54:39,758 --> 00:54:42,428
This is the real Ivan the Terrible!

552
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,936
Do you remember I was telling you
about the time machine?

553
00:54:48,186 --> 00:54:51,648
Well, Shurik did succeed with
that experiment!

554
00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:03,0003
- But he could have killed me!
- And would have done good!

555
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:06,0006
It's crazy!

556
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:11,337
What do you mean, Ivan the Terrible?
He's been long dead!

557
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:14,550
- Who's dead?
- I didn't mean you.

558
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:17,762
I mean the other one,
the one who's been dead...

559
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:30,030
- Did You seduce the Boyar woman?
- Yes, I did.

560
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:35,242
I am he... that liveth...

561
00:55:35,826 --> 00:55:40,498
What do you mean, you liveth,
vile dog? Look at yourself!

562
00:55:40,623 --> 00:55:41,958
Liveth!

563
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:45,587
- Help me. Say something in Slavonic.
- Thy!

564
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,885
Thy... thy cherub.

565
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:52,763
Your Excellency, have mercy!

566
00:55:53,514 --> 00:55:55,599
You have misunderstood me.

567
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,438
How can I understand you,
if you don't say anything?

568
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:02,734
I don't know foreign languages,
your highness.

569
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:07,405
- do You love this Boyar woman?
- I'm crazy about her!

570
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,829
Look at her! Beauteous to behold,

571
00:56:13,013 --> 00:56:16,916
crimson in her lips, crescents in her
brows!

572
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:20,754
- What more do you want, dog?
- Nothing!

573
00:56:21,021 --> 00:56:24,024
Then marry her, fool!
The prince is letting her go.

574
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,763
I'm asking for your hand,
Zinaida Mikhailovna!

575
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,641
Hello? Galya? You're going to fall
down! I've got great news!

576
00:56:33,854 --> 00:56:36,399
Yakin has left his witch,

577
00:56:36,649 --> 00:56:38,776
and we're going to Gagry.

578
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:43,866
Well, you sinning beard! Should I
hear that you've done something...

579
00:56:44,158 --> 00:56:46,495
- I swear!
- Don't interrupt the tsar!

580
00:56:46,745 --> 00:56:50,831
- Yes, Sire!
- I'm giving you one of my coats.

581
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:57,057
- Thank him! Thank him!
- Thou art... I thank thee humbly!

582
00:56:59,802 --> 00:57:01,554
Sire!

583
00:57:01,804 --> 00:57:04,0004
You can't stay here
looking like this!

584
00:57:05,892 --> 00:57:08,186
People might think I don't know what.

585
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:14,343
Oh, God Almighty!
I forgot where I am, O Lord!

586
00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:15,612
I've forgotten everything!

587
00:57:15,738 --> 00:57:19,659
You must change your clothes,
Ivan Vassilyevich!

588
00:57:20,744 --> 00:57:24,874
Oh, the demons' garb!
A temptation...

589
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:31,757
My mind is all confused.
The coat, the Tsar Ivan the Terrible...

590
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:36,376
Stop being so fidgety! Well, it is
Ivan the Terrible. So what? Big deal!

591
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:39,349
You had better go
and help the tsar change.

592
00:57:39,475 --> 00:57:40,809
Yes, ma'am.

593
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,898
Hello? Vava?
You'll never believe it!

594
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:48,986
Oh, my God!

595
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:56,453
He looks so much like our Bunsha!

596
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:01,334
- Pah!
- It looks very good on you.

597
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:04,880
- Dear Tsar, we must go.
- Perchance... we shalt...

598
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:08,0008
We have a plane to catch.

599
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:11,221
Godspeed!

600
00:58:11,513 --> 00:58:13,765
May we thank you for everything?

601
00:58:14,434 --> 00:58:19,438
You're a very spirited man!

602
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:42,133
Hello? Shurochka?

603
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,304
Can you imagine? Yakin
fell for me like a silly boy.

604
00:58:45,554 --> 00:58:51,102
He proposed, and we're leaving
for our honeymoon. Many kisses.

605
00:58:52,103 --> 00:58:53,438
Go!

606
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:04,652
Oh, how beautiful it is!
Beauteous!

607
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:17,717
Beauteous!

608
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:21,305
Cigarette break!

609
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,386
- The Swedish Ambassador!
- What's up, Fedya?

610
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,281
The Swedish ambassador
asks for an audience.

611
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:12,491
Bring the ambassador in.

612
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:19,019
Knit your brows! Knit your brows!

613
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,548
Der grosse Konig,

614
01:00:58,965 --> 01:01:03,886
Des Schwedischen Konigreichs sende
mich,

615
01:01:05,305 --> 01:01:07,725
seinen treuen Diener,

616
01:01:08,184 --> 01:01:13,648
zu Ihnen, Czar and Grande Duc

617
01:01:13,865 --> 01:01:19,701
Ivan Vassilyevich...

618
01:01:18,697 --> 01:01:20,574
usarussa.

619
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:24,244
- This foreign tourist speaks well!
- What exactly does he say?

620
01:01:24,495 --> 01:01:26,956
I'll be damned if I know.
Fedya!

621
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:31,921
- We need an interpreter.
- We had one. He was German.

622
01:01:32,338 --> 01:01:34,590
He got drunk as a lord
when he had to translate.

623
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:38,344
- So We cooked him in boiled water.
- It's not the way to treat interpreters.

624
01:01:38,887 --> 01:01:41,807
Schwedete armie erobern hut.

625
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:46,639
Answer something.
See, the man goes out of his way.

626
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:47,981
Hitler kaput!

627
01:01:48,482 --> 01:01:51,986
Go on, Mister Ambassador.
We absolutely agree with you.

628
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:56,241
- Kemska district.
- Right. Absolutely.

629
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,247
Absolutely.

630
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:06,671
Look, comrade.
Excuse us for a minute.

631
01:02:07,629 --> 01:02:11,969
I would like to know
what he wants, in general terms.

632
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:14,972
It's very simple.

633
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:19,269
They want Kemsk Region. They went to
war, so, they say, give it to us.

634
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:21,980
What? Kemsk Region?

635
01:02:22,523 --> 01:02:26,152
Ja, Kemska rejion. Ja, ja...

636
01:02:27,112 --> 01:02:30,115
Take it if you want it! Oh, God!
I thought it was something important.

637
01:02:30,407 --> 01:02:33,870
- But you can't do it, benefactor.
- The tsar knows what he's doing.

638
01:02:34,454 --> 01:02:38,292
Our state won't be any poorer for it.
Take it! Take it!

639
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:43,131
Have mercy, our great tsar,
and allow me to speak.

640
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:50,135
What are you doing, son of a bitch?
Some impostor squandering our lands!

641
01:02:50,848 --> 01:02:52,976
We shall never have enough regions
for you!

642
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:55,688
So whadda I say my king?

643
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,153
Say your king
my warm greetings.

644
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:03,697
Whadda about Kemsk region?

645
01:03:04,0004 --> 01:03:07,702
Such questions, my dear ambassador,
are not decided at the drop of a hat.

646
01:03:08,0008 --> 01:03:11,875
We have to consult with comrades.
Come back in a few days.

647
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:16,016
Yes, by the way, here's a little
souvenir for you from me.

648
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:21,219
Here!

649
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:34,984
Well, auf Wiedersehen!
Goodbye! Au revoir! In short, ciao!

650
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:43,954
Everyone can go!

651
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,335
The guards can go, too.

652
01:03:50,337 --> 01:03:52,256
The guards can go.

653
01:04:03,561 --> 01:04:05,647
Why are you crawling, old chap?

654
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:09,0009
The ambassador has lost his chest
decoration.

655
01:04:10,235 --> 01:04:15,242
He shouldn't be so absent-minded. One
should watch his things when in a room.

656
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:19,622
Why are you staring at me?

657
01:04:19,914 --> 01:04:22,959
- do You think I took it?
- No, of course not!

658
01:04:23,023 --> 01:04:25,844
You didn't take it, did you?

659
01:04:27,465 --> 01:04:29,592
Maybe it has slid under the throne?

660
01:04:30,885 --> 01:04:32,221
No.

661
01:04:33,472 --> 01:04:35,035
Well, then nothing can be done.

662
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:37,037
What a misfortune!

663
01:04:44,485 --> 01:04:47,989
I am again tormented by some
troubling doubts.

664
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:52,118
Shpak's tape recorder,
the ambassador's medal...

665
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,289
What are you driving at?

666
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:58,127
I'm asking you, you tsar's mug,
what are you hinting at?

667
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:02,339
The Tartar Prince Yedigey is here
to see the tsar.

668
01:05:02,631 --> 01:05:05,302
No.
That's too much.

669
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:10,433
Calling hours are over.
We have a lunch break.

670
01:05:12,478 --> 01:05:15,397
The tsar wishes to refect.

671
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:33,628
- I must be dreaming!
- Just a minute.

672
01:05:33,878 --> 01:05:38,217
- Who's going to pay for this banquet?
- In any case, not us.

673
01:05:38,592 --> 01:05:40,344
Fedya, what is in there?

674
01:05:41,846 --> 01:05:43,765
Hare's kidneys,

675
01:05:44,558 --> 01:05:48,048
pike heads with garlic.
Black caviar.

676
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:50,050
Red caviar.

677
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:53,276
And from overseas...

678
01:05:55,821 --> 01:05:57,656
Eggplant caviar!

679
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:00,451
Beautiful!

680
01:06:00,743 --> 01:06:04,540
- Well, tsar, let's drink.
- Let's drink.

681
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:34,701
Beauteous!

682
01:06:34,826 --> 01:06:38,331
I look for him all over the house, and
here's he, in someone else's flat.

683
01:06:38,581 --> 01:06:40,584
Why don't you look me in the eye?

684
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:43,211
Ivan Vassilyevich,
I've been burglarized!

685
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:48,176
Everything I've got by working
tirelessly, everything is gone!

686
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:51,722
Oh, look at you!
You're blind drunk!

687
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:55,392
You don't look like yourself!
What on earth did you put on yourself?

688
01:06:55,726 --> 01:06:59,814
- Imported tape recorder, suede jacket...
- He's drunk!

689
01:07:00,106 --> 01:07:01,650
There's nothing left!

690
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,112
He can't stand on his feet!
Where are you going?

691
01:07:06,531 --> 01:07:10,202
Oh, God! What's going on?
Go home now, alcoholic!

692
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:12,308
Leave me alone, old woman,
I'm being sad.

693
01:07:14,206 --> 01:07:17,294
Old woman? You jerk!

694
01:07:17,627 --> 01:07:19,630
I'm five years younger than you!

695
01:07:20,256 --> 01:07:22,301
Let's go home, now!

696
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:24,633
You are a witch!

697
01:07:25,678 --> 01:07:27,556
Help!

698
01:07:28,028 --> 01:07:31,270
Ivan Vassilyevich, calm down.

699
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:36,618
- Witch!
- To be absolutely honest, yes.

700
01:07:38,409 --> 01:07:41,837
- And What do You want?
- Dear Ivan Vassilyevich,

701
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:45,244
that's the list of stolen things.

702
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,961
Two tape recorders, two movie cameras,
two cigarette cases. Please!

703
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:54,054
Is it the way to hand in a petition
to the tsar?

704
01:07:54,297 --> 01:07:57,675
What do you mean? Stop your
hooliganism!

705
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:04,476
You and your drunken tricks! I'll file
a collective complaint against you!

706
01:08:04,768 --> 01:08:07,814
I see you never stop, lackey!

707
01:08:09,522 --> 01:08:12,735
Hello? Is that a psychiatric ward?

708
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:18,367
My husband has got a delirium tremens.
He attacks people with a knife.

709
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:21,778
- Stop! Take the knife away!
- The knife!

710
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:26,940
Just look at our activist!
He's an armed bandit!

711
01:08:27,962 --> 01:08:30,340
- Lowly trash!
- You're trash yourself!

712
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,032
Lackey!

713
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:34,512
The police will decide who's a lackey
here!

714
01:08:35,555 --> 01:08:36,889
Is it the police?

715
01:08:37,933 --> 01:08:41,229
- Wait! He's not Bunsha!
- What do you mean, not Bunsha?

716
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:44,899
He's Ivan the Terrible. The real one.

717
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:59,824
I'm busy. Call me later.

718
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:04,548
- Oh, my God! What's going on?
- I revealed a big secret to you.

719
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:07,468
I beg you to promise that you won't
tell anybody.

720
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,931
Of course! You have my word.

721
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:14,975
- Thank You.
- Don't mention it.

722
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:21,652
Hello? The police?

723
01:09:22,022 --> 01:09:25,447
That's Shpak speaking, who's been
burglarized.

724
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:29,029
No, it's not about the robbery.
We've got something more weird here.

725
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:32,271
Engineer Timofeyev has a live
tsar in his apartment.

726
01:09:34,459 --> 01:09:38,672
No, I don't drink.
With a dagger, cold steel...

727
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:42,510
I'm giving you my word of honor!

728
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,680
I'll be waiting.

729
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:55,359
I can imagine how they fight now
on Izyum Road.

730
01:09:55,184 --> 01:09:59,772
Fedya, what are you doing there, by
the kidneys? Come here, don't be shy.

731
01:10:01,0001 --> 01:10:04,536
Here!
Let's drink to friendship!

732
01:10:05,763 --> 01:10:10,648
Listen, old chap, do they accept
jewelry at your pawn shop?

733
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,634
- We can arrange it.
- Let's drink.

734
01:10:15,967 --> 01:10:20,305
The tsarina is here, Sire.
She wants to see you.

735
01:10:24,393 --> 01:10:28,733
Fedya, go back to the kidneys! It was a
bad move. You don't look like a tsar.

736
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:33,446
What? Whoa! Whoa!
Who are you talking to, lackey?

737
01:10:39,704 --> 01:10:44,709
Dear tsarina! I'm so glad!
Nice meeting you! My pleasure.

738
01:10:45,045 --> 01:10:49,215
Hello, I'm the tsar. Nice to meet you.
How do you do, I'm the tsar...

739
01:10:49,542 --> 01:10:55,055
Very pleased, I'm the tsar. Nice to
meet you, I'm the tsar. Very pleased.

740
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,937
Please, come to our table.

741
01:11:01,0001 --> 01:11:04,733
This way, please.
Please...

742
01:11:05,693 --> 01:11:07,696
Haven't we met before?

743
01:11:07,946 --> 01:11:10,408
- What are you saying, shit?
- Whoa! Whoa!

744
01:11:10,658 --> 01:11:14,704
Hey! Waiter!
One order of kidneys for the tsarina.

745
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,207
Excuse me for a minute.

746
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,862
- Sorry, your name, please?
- Why, I'm Marfa Vassilyevna.

747
01:11:23,215 --> 01:11:26,384
Wonderful! Enchanting!

748
01:11:27,219 --> 01:11:30,599
Marfa Vassilyevna, how enchanting!
A glass of cardamom vodka?

749
01:11:30,891 --> 01:11:33,685
- Oh, no!
- Why? Please, don't refuse.

750
01:11:34,312 --> 01:11:36,313
Your health!

751
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,281
Well, everyone keeps saying: tsar,
tsar...

752
01:11:43,906 --> 01:11:46,826
You think, Marfa Vassilyevna,
it's easy to be a tsar?

753
01:11:47,047 --> 01:11:49,579
No, on the contrary!

754
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:53,266
Every working man has two days off,
and we, the tsars, have no days off.

755
01:11:54,503 --> 01:11:57,256
And our working hours are not fixed.

756
01:11:57,233 --> 01:12:01,481
Please, eat, Margarita Vassilyevna.
Everything has been paid for.

757
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:08,979
You know, a tsar's job is so unhealthy
that we should be given free milk.

758
01:12:09,312 --> 01:12:11,731
They wrote it in the Health Magazine

759
01:12:12,273 --> 01:12:14,943
that the nervous cells are never
restored.

760
01:12:15,194 --> 01:12:19,449
You work and work, our great tsar,
just like a bee!

761
01:12:20,617 --> 01:12:25,748
Margo, you alone understand me!

762
01:12:27,027 --> 01:12:31,180
- One more glass to Go with a pike head?
- Oh, no! No!

763
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:38,180
Tell me, please, do you have
private rooms here?

764
01:12:38,597 --> 01:12:41,267
- I see you're dead drunk!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

765
01:12:41,517 --> 01:12:45,271
Why don't you play, maestro?
Strike up a song!

766
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:55,867
That's not a big black cloud coming...

767
01:12:57,369 --> 01:12:58,704
A cloud!

768
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:05,546
That's not a thunderstorm striking...

769
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,510
A thunderstorm!

770
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:18,937
That's the tsar of Crimea, a vile dog...

771
01:13:21,983 --> 01:13:23,317
A dog!

772
01:13:29,533 --> 01:13:32,203
What do you mean, a dog?

773
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:35,666
How dare you sing such songs
about a tsar?

774
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:39,962
You got out of hand here, without me.
What kind of a repertoire is that?

775
01:13:40,838 --> 01:13:44,718
You ought to sing songs for the masses,
something contemporary.

776
01:13:44,968 --> 01:13:48,430
Like... how does it go?
Trali-vali, tili-tili.

777
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,393
We're not the tili-tili,
we're not the trali-vali.

778
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,055
Cool it, Vanya. We'll do everything.

779
01:13:56,148 --> 01:13:58,819
Excuse me, what's your name again?

780
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:01,779
- I'm Marfa Vassilyevna!
- Yes, of course, Marfa.

781
01:14:02,781 --> 01:14:05,827
Oh, Marfusha! The night is still young!

782
01:14:06,494 --> 01:14:09,0009
Give us a line,
and we'll pick it up.

783
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:11,165
Wait! Quiet!

784
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:13,668
All of a sudden,

785
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:17,424
Out of the blue,

786
01:14:18,843 --> 01:14:21,803
Love knocked down

787
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:24,431
Upon my door.

788
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:31,031
Is that it? Is that you?
I couldn't hope for anything more.

789
01:14:31,817 --> 01:14:35,237
Snow was falling, dawn after dawn,

790
01:14:35,612 --> 01:14:38,324
Days were rainy and mean.

791
01:14:38,867 --> 01:14:42,204
So many years, why were you gone?

792
01:14:42,788 --> 01:14:47,251
Where have you ever been?

793
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:53,927
Like in a dream, the doorjust creaked,

794
01:14:54,509 --> 01:14:58,058
And suddenly, all made sense.

795
01:14:58,348 --> 01:15:01,227
Fate played tricks. Fate intrigued.

796
01:15:01,602 --> 01:15:04,0004
And here's our meeting, hence.

797
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,858
I froze at sea, traveled by train.

798
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:09,403
I know it was not in vain.

799
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:14,951
No, it was not in vain,
It was not for nothing.

800
01:15:15,995 --> 01:15:21,334
All has happened, all came true.
Nobody knows, how.

801
01:15:21,834 --> 01:15:27,716
How could I live all this through?
It's just incredible! Wow!

802
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:33,558
If you wait and take it in,
whatever ever lies in store...

803
01:15:34,141 --> 01:15:37,271
Then you can get it, what you dreamed
for,

804
01:15:37,521 --> 01:15:40,941
And go hope for more.

805
01:15:40,352 --> 01:15:41,811
Everybody dance!

806
01:15:43,527 --> 01:15:47,908
Like in a dream, the doorjust creaked,

807
01:15:48,242 --> 01:15:51,704
And, suddenly, all made sense.

808
01:15:51,996 --> 01:15:54,916
Fate played tricks. Fate intrigued.

809
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:57,461
And here's our meeting, hence.

810
01:15:57,837 --> 01:16:00,297
I froze at sea, traveled by train.

811
01:16:00,547 --> 01:16:03,0003
I know it was not in vain.

812
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:08,183
No, it was not in vain,
It was not for nothing.

813
01:17:24,942 --> 01:17:30,197
A mutiny in the army!
They say that the tsar's not real!

814
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:43,922
My dear autocrat, we're done in!

815
01:17:44,882 --> 01:17:47,760
I demand that the banquet go on!

816
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:52,891
Why are we done in? Why?

817
01:18:28,309 --> 01:18:29,644
This way!

818
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:37,946
Come on, Prince, hurry up!
Send me back!

819
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:41,283
Everything will be ready in 3 minutes.

820
01:19:03,226 --> 01:19:07,356
Wait a bit, Ivan Vassilyevich. You'd
better change into your tsar's clothes.

821
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:09,316
Damn!

822
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:31,802
Do you smoke?

823
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:37,142
You don't? Good.
I don't smoke either.

824
01:19:37,601 --> 01:19:40,187
So tell me, who are you?

825
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:44,450
- I am the tsar.
- Nickname?

826
01:19:43,608 --> 01:19:47,905
- Wait. your name?
- We're the Ryuriks.

827
01:19:48,364 --> 01:19:51,867
- First, second name?
- Ivan Vassilyevich.

828
01:19:52,326 --> 01:19:54,054
Ivan...

829
01:19:54,621 --> 01:20:00,212
- Date of birth?
- 1533 A.D.

830
01:20:01,921 --> 01:20:05,133
- Joking?
- Very funny.

831
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:09,473
- Wait. Residence?
- My palace.

832
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:14,436
What palace?
The address?

833
01:20:15,015 --> 01:20:19,019
- What am I accused of, Boyar?
- You'll meet your boyars in the can!

834
01:20:19,568 --> 01:20:22,822
- Was it you who busted Shpak's place?
- Shpak's?

835
01:20:23,572 --> 01:20:26,826
I took Kazan, I took Astrakhan,

836
01:20:27,027 --> 01:20:30,372
I took Revel,
but never Shpak.

837
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:33,418
There he is! You're bagged!
It serves you right, drunkard!

838
01:20:33,533 --> 01:20:36,924
-What's up, folks? Who are you?
-Lieutenant, I'm this alcoholic's wife!

839
01:20:37,631 --> 01:20:41,177
You're lying!
How can you be my wife, old woman?

840
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:45,045
See? He got drunk out of his wits!
He can't recognize his own wife!

841
01:20:45,724 --> 01:20:48,769
I had to call the psychiatric ward.

842
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:53,317
Oh, that's what it's all about!
That's why all these ravings.

843
01:20:53,609 --> 01:20:57,695
He took Kazan. He took Astrakhan.
He calls himself Ivan the Terrible.

844
01:20:57,988 --> 01:21:00,325
It's delirium tremens.
A typical case.

845
01:21:00,575 --> 01:21:03,829
What's the patient's real name?

846
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:07,917
- Bunsha, Ivan Vassilyevich.
- You're lying, witch!

847
01:21:08,293 --> 01:21:10,212
I hate him!

848
01:21:11,254 --> 01:21:12,589
Attention!

849
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,968
Get ready!

850
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:26,982
Take the impostors alive!

851
01:21:37,408 --> 01:21:40,160
Black caviar!

852
01:21:41,321 --> 01:21:44,044
Red caviar!

853
01:21:45,754 --> 01:21:48,216
And from overseas, eggplant caviar!

854
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:44,169
Comrade Timofeyev! Alexander
Sergeyevich! Help me!

855
01:22:44,481 --> 01:22:48,048
Ivan Vassilyevich, hurry up!
Goodbye!

856
01:23:02,0002 --> 01:23:05,601
- are You all right?
- All right. You'll never believe it!

857
01:23:06,0006 --> 01:23:11,858
The police will believe it! You will
answer for your anti-social experiments!

858
01:23:13,944 --> 01:23:16,016
Sire!
Just a minute!

859
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:31,031
Why do you have police at your door,
comrade scientist?

860
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,843
There was a burglary at your friend
Shpak's today.

861
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,304
Really?

862
01:23:40,892 --> 01:23:45,774
- We detained One more.
- No, not detained!

863
01:23:46,357 --> 01:23:50,614
Not detained. I was on my way
to make a voluntary confession.

864
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:55,493
I'm delighted to hand myself in to my
dear police. I set on it all my hopes.

865
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:59,374
- Who are you?
- Bunsha, Ivan Vassilyevich.

866
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:04,421
So you insist that you're Ivan
Vassilyevich Bunsha?

867
01:24:04,712 --> 01:24:06,674
Your ID, please.

868
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,555
- I forgot it at home.
- Who can corroborate your statement?

869
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:17,938
Well, anybody! You may ask my wife,
Ulyana. She will confirm it.

870
01:24:18,230 --> 01:24:20,482
Well, well, well.

871
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:24,024
What did you want to make
a voluntary confession about?

872
01:24:25,025 --> 01:24:28,427
I confess that against my will, under
the compulsion of Prince Miloslavsky,

873
01:24:29,326 --> 01:24:31,746
I acted temporarily as a tsar.

874
01:24:32,289 --> 01:24:34,458
A tsar?
You are a tsar, too?

875
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,419
Yes, a tsar.
Ivan Vassilyevich the Terrible.

876
01:24:37,795 --> 01:24:41,675
You're lying, dog!
I am the tsar!

877
01:24:43,552 --> 01:24:45,045
Hooligan!

878
01:24:46,262 --> 01:24:50,142
Everything I've got by working
tirelessly, everything is gone!

879
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:54,054
Three tape recorders,
three imported movie cameras,

880
01:24:54,273 --> 01:25:01,322
three home-made cigarette cases,
a suede jacket... Three jackets!

881
01:25:02,366 --> 01:25:07,414
And they want to be awarded the title
of a house of cultured communal living!

882
01:25:09,249 --> 01:25:13,504
Ulyana Andreyevna, tell us again
who he is.

883
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:17,801
I've already told you!

884
01:25:18,018 --> 01:25:20,763
My husband, Ivan Vassilyevich Bunsha.

885
01:25:20,971 --> 01:25:24,726
- They'll cure you, alcoholic.
- Fine! Then who is this?

886
01:25:29,274 --> 01:25:33,033
- Impostor!
- You're an impostor yourself! Got it?

887
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:40,749
- So, who is he?
-My husband! Ivan Vassilyevich Bunsha.

888
01:25:37,158 --> 01:25:42,747
They will cure you, too.

889
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:50,758
- It turns out you've got 2 husbands?
- So it turns out.

890
01:25:51,051 --> 01:25:52,927
And they're both Bunshas?

891
01:25:56,264 --> 01:25:57,682
Yes, both of them.

892
01:26:01,103 --> 01:26:03,480
You'll be cured.

893
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:06,149
And you'll be cured.

894
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,660
And I'll be cured, too.

895
01:26:13,659 --> 01:26:17,956
What you told me is grandiose!
You're such a valuable eyewitness!

896
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:21,628
If I were you,
I'd put a dissertation in the can.

897
01:26:22,796 --> 01:26:25,633
I ain't in no hurry.
I can end up in the can any time.

898
01:26:35,978 --> 01:26:40,040
Is that it? Is that you?
I couldn't hope for anything more.

899
01:26:41,735 --> 01:26:44,239
Ulyana Andreyevna,
I was faithful to you.

900
01:26:44,489 --> 01:26:48,410
The tsarina tried to seduce me,
but I didn't give in. I swear!

901
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:59,339
- Miloslavsky was almost in our hands!
- George Miloslavsky?

902
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,0002
- Yes! Arrest him!
- Right.

903
01:27:03,761 --> 01:27:05,0005
Wait!

904
01:27:03,389 --> 01:27:08,514
Hold on! Get him!
Catch Miloslavsky!

905
01:27:43,683 --> 01:27:47,301
I was absolutely sure
that I had sent you back.

906
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:51,653
Hurry up, Prince.
Get your machine working.

907
01:27:52,052 --> 01:27:55,991
- Where have You been all this time?
-The police bagged me. Framing me up.

908
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:05,502
They're after me, Prince!
Hurry up! Hurry! Oh, my God!

909
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:10,010
Run, Ivan Vassilyevich!

910
01:28:13,638 --> 01:28:16,640
- Hurry, Ivan Vassilyevich!
- Yes, I'm coming!

911
01:28:16,892 --> 01:28:19,019
Oh, God, forgive me my sins!

912
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:22,314
Evil spirit!

913
01:28:23,274 --> 01:28:29,114
- Farewell, Prince!
- Good luck! Don't think ill of me.

914
01:28:56,429 --> 01:28:59,890
- It's outrageous!
- You put out electricity again!

915
01:29:00,235 --> 01:29:03,239
- He's taunting us!
- We're going to complain!

916
01:29:04,114 --> 01:29:06,994
Oh, you're already out of the asylum?

917
01:29:07,327 --> 01:29:10,247
- Stop your hooliganism!
- What's the matter?

918
01:29:10,539 --> 01:29:12,291
That's scandalous!

919
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:18,174
He's wearing glasses just for nothing!
You'll be brought to court for that!

920
01:29:21,135 --> 01:29:24,681
We send them to college,
and in return we're going bald!

921
01:29:27,351 --> 01:29:28,812
What was it?

922
01:29:29,562 --> 01:29:33,901
Was itjust a dream, or was it real?

923
01:29:35,528 --> 01:29:39,039
Ivan the Terrible... Miloslavsky...

924
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:43,043
Oh, I forgot. Zina has left me.

925
01:29:48,669 --> 01:29:51,172
No, it's all nonsense!

926
01:29:52,215 --> 01:29:54,675
I was just knocked out!

927
01:29:56,553 --> 01:29:58,513
And what if it's not nonsense?

928
01:29:59,348 --> 01:30:02,0002
My goodness!
What is going on here?

929
01:30:02,477 --> 01:30:04,478
You smoked again!

930
01:30:05,563 --> 01:30:07,607
And, of course, you didn't eat
your lunch.

931
01:30:16,391 --> 01:30:21,979
- You haven't left for Gagry?
- What do you mean, Gagry?

932
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:24,211
You're going crazy
with your machine!

933
01:30:30,427 --> 01:30:32,722
Oh, how did you get yourself
such a bump?

934
01:30:35,893 --> 01:30:39,396
Zina, tell me the truth.

935
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:43,651
- Where have You been?
- At a rehearsal.

936
01:30:43,818 --> 01:30:45,153
All right...

937
01:30:45,404 --> 01:30:49,950
Give me a straight answer.
Are you in love with Yakin?

938
01:30:50,865 --> 01:30:56,529
- What Yakin? What is it with You?
- Don't lie to me. He's your director.

939
01:30:58,378 --> 01:31:01,171
We have no director by that name.

940
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:06,262
- Is it true?
- I swear.

941
01:31:07,222 --> 01:31:08,557
Hurray!

942
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:33,419
Ciao!

943
01:31:33,877 --> 01:31:36,590
Thank you for your attention!

944
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,759
The End
