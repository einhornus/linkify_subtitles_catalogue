1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,019
Until

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:09,549
1918, until the Bolsheviks reformed Russian spelling, a solid sign was always written at the end of words after consonants.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,959
What for?

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,719
Some people think that since there is a soft sign and it denotes softness, then the hard one also denoted hardness.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,549
Probably, a Komsomol activist from Platonov’s novel “The Pit” would agree with this opinion:

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:28,538
“Slogans are indicated by a line from words and a hard sign is more useful to us than a soft one.  This soft must be abolished, and hard is inevitable for us:

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,598
it makes the wording rigid and clear.

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,078
But... is it really so?

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,218
Short answer: of

10
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:37,749
course not.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:45,069
In the Old Russian language, until the twelfth century, such a sound law operated: all syllables had to end in a vowel.  Well,

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,529
such rules, nowhere to go.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:55,808
For example, a syllable is structured in a similar way in modern Japanese:

14
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:00,759
At the same time, Old Russian also had two vowel sounds, which we do not have now.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:08,559
They were written with these letters.  And attention: they are only now called hard and soft signs, and earlier they were called

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,399
"er" and "er" respectively;  also in science they are called

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,809
reduced.

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,349
The letter "er" denoted a very short sound [ɪ], the

19
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,709
letter "er" - the same short [ɤ].

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,569
yt zl ps

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:31,809
that evil dog

22
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:39,908
But in the XII century there was one phonetic change: according to a certain scheme, the nuances of which we will now keep silent for brevity, all the

23
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,619
reduced ones were divided into strong and weak.

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,439
The strong ones became full vowels:

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,099
"ъ" became "o", and "ь" became "e".

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:58,718
The weak simply disappeared or, as they say, fell.  Therefore, everything that happened is called the fall of the reduced.

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,868
Agree, now the language has become much more similar to the modern one both in sound and in writing.

28
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,298
Pronunciation of the XIII century:

29
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,298

30
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:13,239

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:22,059
ime, they stopped writing eps in the middle of words, but they remained at the end of the word, and this habit lingered in our spelling right up to 1918,

32
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:32,739
until the Bolshevik boot trampled the dilapidated ep  .

33
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:41,139
 Of course, one can assume that the final ep continued to be written according to tradition, but this is a bad explanation - there is a better explanation.

34
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:48,879
The fact is that in the Middle Ages they wrote without spaces.  More or less often gaps appear in use in Russian books and manuscripts only in the

35
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,199
17th century.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,299
The gap was finally established only in the eighteenth, when the typography was turned to the Western style.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,989
With continuous writing, ep served as a reliable guideline for the boundary between words.  You see it - and you immediately understand that

38
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,219
a new word begins next.  This made it a little easier to read.

39
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,699
Particularly astute viewers here may ask: why then was it not easier to immediately jump to the gap?

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,179
The fact is that in ancient times it was necessary first of all to take care of saving writing material, but not about the convenience of reading, while

41
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,369
spaces take up too much space.

42
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,729
Also, in ancient times, the division into words was not necessary for the same thing as it is now.  Right now we have a different psychology of reading:

43
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,809
we almost always read to ourselves, without saying a word.  With this manner of reading, it is very important for the eye to distinguish between

44
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:42,999
individual words, because we perceive them as a single whole, almost like a hieroglyph: “This is proved by that very wonderful experiment,

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,089
where different letters of words were swapped, except for final and initial ones.

46
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,039
Only the general form of the word and the context allow us to understand everything correctly, moreover, to read quickly.

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,469
We don't focus on every single letter, we only do this when we stumble or when reading

48
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,109
unfamiliar words.  As you understand, all this would be impossible when reading the text without spaces.

49
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,409
Let's also not forget that earlier people had many times less

50
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:16,778
reading practice, and therefore, in general, they were less literate;  there was also discord in spelling, and therefore many read simply by syllables.

51
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,078
When reading by syllables, spaces in general are not particularly needed.

52
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,478
But you need to understand very clearly where the syllable ends in order to make fewer mistakes in syllable division.

53
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:32,258
And the final ep just allowed not to mix the last syllable of one word, which ends in a consonant, with the first syllable of the next word.

54
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:39,909
And here it is the complement of the argument against the space.  Remember that we need to save writing material;  Now consider:

55
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,508
we need to write ep only after those words that end in a consonant, and a space needs to be written after all words - it

56
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,559
takes up a lot of space, but we don’t need it for readability.

57
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,059
Okay, okay, now we understand why er was needed in Old Russian writing.

58
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,469
But why was it not removed in the 18th century, say, under Peter, because then

59
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,049
many letters were removed from the alphabet;  and in general the language changed rapidly;  and there were gaps everywhere;

60
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,799
people read like a Western educated public: no longer aloud, but to themselves - why didn't they remove the ep?

61
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,879
It must be said that the first cases in which the final er was omitted arose long before the 18th century, namely, immediately after the fall of the reduced

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,649
in the 12th century.  And this was, of course, not found in books, not in some official documents, but in everyday writing, namely, in birch bark letters.

63
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:34,478
So let's say that in the tenth birch bark letter from Staraya Russa, the final ep is not written in most positions.  Well, for example:

64
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,989
"... in the settlements ...", "... the rogue nobles

65
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,759
messed up ...".

66
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,448
Also, even before the end of the 18th century, such a way of shortening a word as a final extended consonant was often found in manuscripts.

67
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:53,439
As a general rule, ep was not written after extended consonants;  and even if we perceived it as a sign of the end of a word, here it would be

68
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:01,089
redundant, because the extension consonant already rises above all other letters and already clearly shows where the word ends.

69
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,679
The first books without a final er were printed at the end of the 13th century.

70
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,879
For example, in several books of academic news

71
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,919
in 1781, a whole section of evidence of the latest works of various academies was published for the sake of experiment without era.

72
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,599
In the 19th century, there were already many different editions without eras and, what is remarkable, mostly

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,439
oppositional to the regime.

74
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,199
And in 1904, the Ministry of the Interior, even by a special circular, banned the printing of books without era.

75
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,179
But there was no massive rejection of the final era, even in personal documents.  It would seem, well, why not write differently: it would also be easier,

76
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,639
faster;  but no.  The fact is that the interests of the reader should always be

77
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,019
above the interests of the writer, because one person writes, but

78
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,359
a lot of people read.  And people who now read a lot of the old spelling

79
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,819
noticed that when there is ep, it is easier to read, a little even faster, because

80
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,799
if in modern orthography we have only one character that marks the boundary of a word, this is a space;

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,199
then in the old orthography we often encountered a sequence of characters, that is, ep + space.

82
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,549
That is why in general there are fewer spaces in pre-revolutionary fonts than in modern ones.  Also, the benefits of the trailing ep are clearly visible when reading

83
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,359
handwritten texts, because there the width of the space is different each time, sometimes it can be barely noticeable at all.

84
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:31,999
There is another explanation why the trailing ep was left for so long.  I personally do not find it convincing, but it sounds curious.  He was cited in his

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,799
1918 article by the artist Boris Nikolaevich Nikolaev.  Let's consider it:

86
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,959
there is a letter that, as it were, looks against the direction of reading - from right to left;

87
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,199
there are standing letters;  and there are those who look from left to right.

88
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,729
And reading the text, where most of the letters look from left to right - in the direction of reading, is the

89
00:07:52,730 --> 00:08:00,079
easiest.  Compare, there are three lines: in the first, most of the letters look against the direction of reading;  in the second, most of the letters are

90
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,079
standing, they do not look anywhere;  and in the third, most of the letters look in the direction of reading

91
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,819
In Russian texts, in total, there are much fewer letters that look in the direction of reading than in texts in Latin

92
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:20,269
in European languages.  That is why the Cyrillic alphabet is in some respects a little more difficult for visual perception than the Latin alphabet.

93
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,199
And what happens: ep looks in the direction of reading;

94
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,489
because it is at the end of a word, it sets the direction for the whole word, and thus makes it easier for our eye to read.

95
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,619
This function of the er is very clearly visible in the books of the 18th century, where it was often written with a capital letter:

96
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:44,389
in this way it marked the end of the word even more clearly and, perhaps, reading was a little easier.

97
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,739
However, linguists of the early 20th century found all these nuances insignificant.

98
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,369
On the other hand, the reformers proceeded from statistics, according to which the final ep occupied up to 3.5 percent of the

99
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,329
volume of the text, and this alone prevented paper

100
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:06,439
saving.  but only the Bolshevik government

101
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,190
succeeded in realizing this daring undertaking.
