1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,019
Until 1918.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:09,549
until the Bolsheviks reformed Russian spelling, they always put a hard sign at the end of words after consonants.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,959
Why?

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,719
Some people think that since there is a soft sign and it denotes softness, the hard sign denotes hardness.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,549
Probably the Komsomol activist from Platonov's novel "Kotlovan" would agree with this opinion:

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:28,538
"Of the words denoted by the line slogans and the hard sign is more useful to us than the soft sign. The soft sign is to be abolished, while the hard sign is inevitable for us:

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,598
it makes rigidity and clarity of wording."

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,078
But. is this really the case?

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,218
The short answer is:

10
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:37,749
Of course not.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:45,069
In the Old Russian language until the twelfth century there was a sound law: all syllables had to end in a vowel. Well,

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,529
those are the rules, there's no getting around it.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:55,808
For example, the syllables in modern Japanese are arranged in a similar way:

14
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:00,759
At the same time, Old Russian also had two vowel sounds that we don't have now.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:08,559
They were written with these letters. And attention: they're only now called hard and soft signs, but before that they were called

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,399
"yer" and "yer" respectively; also in science they are called

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,809
reduced.

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,349
The letter "yer" denoted a very short sound [ɪ],

19
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,709
The letter "yer" was just as short [ɤ].

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,569
tt'm zl'l'pis

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:31,809
that evil dog.

22
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:39,908
But in the XII century a phonetic change took place: according to a certain scheme, about the nuances of which we will keep silent here for brevity, all

23
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,619
reduced into strong and weak.

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,439
The strong ones turned into full vowels:

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,099
The "ъ" became "o" and the "ъ" became "e".

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:58,718
The weak ones simply disappeared or, as they say, fell. So all that happened is called the fall of the reduplicated.

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,868
You should agree that now the language has become much more similar to the modern language both in sound and in writing.

28
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,298
Pronunciation from the 13th century:

29
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,298
that zol dog

30
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:13,239
sie reaper reaps flax da rye with oats

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:22,059
With time we stopped writing yerows in the middle of words, but they remained at the end of words, and this habit held on in our spelling until

32
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:32,739
1918, until the Bolshevik boot trampled the dilapidated yer.

33
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:41,139
Of course, we can assume that they continued to write the final yer by tradition, but that is a bad explanation - there is a better one.

34
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:48,879
The point is that in the Middle Ages they wrote without spaces. More or less often blanks appeared in Russian books and manuscripts only in

35
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,199
XVII century.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,299
Finally the gap became firmly established only in the eighteenth century, when typography was converted to the Western manner.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,989
In continuous writing the yer was a reliable point of reference between words. When you see it, you know immediately that a new word

38
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,219
a new word begins. This made reading a bit easier.

39
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,699
Especially shrewd onlookers might ask: why wasn't it easier to go straight to the space?

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,179
The thing is that in ancient times you should have taken care of saving writing material first of all, but not about the convenience of reading,

41
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,369
And spaces take up too much space.

42
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,729
Also, in antiquity word division was not necessary for the same reason that it is today. Now we have a different reading psychology:

43
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,809
We almost always read to ourselves without saying the words. In this way of reading, it's very important for the eye to distinguish

44
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:42,999
because we perceive them as a whole, almost like a hieroglyph. "This is proved by that wonderful experiment..,

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,089
where they swapped the different letters of words, except for the final and initial letters.

46
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,039
It is only the overall appearance of the word and the context that allows us to understand everything correctly, and to read it quickly.

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,469
We don't focus on every single letter, we only do that when stuttering or when reading

48
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,109
unfamiliar words. As you can see, all of this would be impossible when reading text without spaces.

49
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,409
Let us also not forget that people used to have many times less

50
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:16,778
reading practice, and so they were generally less literate; there was also variability in spelling, and so many read just syllable by syllable.

51
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,078
When you read syllables, you don't really need spaces.

52
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,478
But you should be very clear about where the syllable ends, so that you could make fewer mistakes in syllabication.

53
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:32,258
And the ending yer just allowed not to mix the last syllable of one word that ends in a consonant, with the first syllable of the next word.

54
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:39,909
And there it is, the addition of the argument against the space. Remember, we need to save writing material; now reason:

55
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,508
we only need to write yer after words that end in a consonant, and we need to write the space after all words -

56
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,559
it takes a lot of space, and we don't need it for easy reading.

57
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,059
Okay, well, now we understand why yer was necessary in the old Russian script.

58
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,469
But why wasn't it removed in the 18th century, say, under Peter?

59
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,049
a lot of letters were taken out of the alphabet, and the language was changing rapidly;

60
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,799
people read like the Western educated public: no longer aloud, but to themselves, why didn't they take out the yer?

61
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,879
It must be said that the first cases where the final yer was dropped appeared long before the eighteenth century, namely right after the fall of the reduplicating

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,649
in the 12th century. And it occurred, of course, not in books, not in any official documents, but in everyday writing, namely in birch bark writings.

63
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:34,478
So, for example, in the tenth birch-bark parchment from Staraya Russa in most positions the final yer is not written. For example:

64
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,989
"...in horodishchanykh...", "...pololosh of noblemen

65
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,759
pacil ...".

66
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,448
Even before the end of the 18th century manuscripts often contained such a way of abbreviating a word as a final carried consonant.

67
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:53,439
As a general rule, yer was not used after expletive consonants, and even if we took it as a sign of the end of a word, it would be

68
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:01,089
The consonant rises above the rest of the letters, and shows expressly where the word ends.

69
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,679
The first books without a consonantal eir were printed at the end of the 13th century.

70
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,879
For instance, in several books of academic notices

71
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,919
In 1781 a whole section of the latest works of various academies was printed for the sake of experiment without the eeir.

72
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,599
In the nineteenth century there were already many different un-erased editions and, remarkably, mostly

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,439
opposition to the regime.

74
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,199
In 1904 the Ministry of Internal Affairs even issued a special circular banning the printing of books without yer.

75
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,179
But there was no mass rejection of the ultimate yer, even in personal documents. One would think, why not write otherwise: it would be easier,

76
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,639
it would be quicker, but no. The fact is that the interests of the reader must always be

77
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,019
above the interests of the writer, because one writes alone, and

78
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,359
reads a lot. And people who have now read a lot of the old spelling,

79
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,819
have noticed that when there's an er, it's easier to read, a little bit even faster, because

80
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,799
If in modern spelling we have only one symbol that marks the boundary of a word, it's a space;

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,199
then in the old orthography we often had a sequence of characters, i.e., er + space.

82
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,549
That is why there are generally fewer spaces in pre-revolutionary fonts than in modern ones. Also, the benefit of the final eer is clearly visible when reading

83
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,359
It is also very useful in the reading of the handwritten texts because the width of the space is different there.

84
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:31,999
There is another explanation of why it took so long to leave the trailing edge. I personally do not find it convincing, but it sounds interesting. It was quoted in his article

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,799
1918, the artist Boris Nikolaevich Nikolayev. Let's take a look at it:

86
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,959
there is a letter that seems to look against the direction of reading - from right to left;

87
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,199
there are standing letters; and there are those that look from left to right.

88
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,729
And reading a text where most of the letters look from left to right - in the reading direction,

89
00:07:52,730 --> 00:08:00,079
is the easiest. Compare, there are three lines: in the first, most of the letters look against the direction of reading; in the second, most of the letters

90
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,079
standing, looking nowhere; and in the third, most of the letters look in the reading direction.

91
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,819
In Russian texts, in total, there are far fewer letters that look in the reading direction than in Latin texts

92
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:20,269
European languages. That's why Cyrillic is, in some ways, slightly more difficult to see than Latin.

93
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,199
And what happens is: the yer looks in the reading direction;

94
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,489
because it is at the end of the word, it gives direction to the whole word, and so it is kind of easier for our eye to read.

95
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,619
This function of the yer is very well seen in eighteenth-century books, where it was often written with a capital letter:

96
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:44,389
in this way it marked the end of the word even more explicitly, and perhaps reading was made a little easier that way.

97
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,739
However, early twentieth-century linguists found all these nuances unimportant.

98
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,369
The reformers, on the other hand, proceeded from the statistics, according to which the final yer was taking up to 3.5 percent

99
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,329
of the text and, by that alone, was an impediment to saving paper.

100
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:06,439
The idea of eliminating the end yer was discussed all through the 19th century, but only the Bolshevik government

101
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,190
to put this audacious idea into practice.
