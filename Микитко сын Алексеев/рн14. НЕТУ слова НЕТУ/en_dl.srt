1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,219
One often hears that the word "no" is allegedly

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,779
no

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,388
what those who say that really don't have is a sense of language.

4
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:14,199
so let's free our mother tongue from the Rosenthal's prison

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,929
and find out why no is better than the word no, how it was used in the past and how it is used now

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:37,719
and most importantly, why language needs such long negations like no or even no-ti.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,889
it's a bit ridiculous to hear that no is a distorted word, no, against the background of real knowledge.

8
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,619
and the knowledge is that it's not no that comes from no, but vice versa.

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,159
But we won't understand today's speech nuance if we don't consider other negations in the history of the Russian language, too

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,079
Let's start with the simplest one, which is the shortest.

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,159
it's the negative particle "not."

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,339
it goes back to Proto-European times, if not even older.

13
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:20,279
and it sounds more or less the same in most European languages.

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,379
and then in Proto-Slavic there's the word don't.

15
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,159
you notice there's a long vowel "e".

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,179
and then it became the "e" sound in Old Russian, which is "I tim".

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,759
which was reflected in the old orthography until 1918, and then again with just a short "e".

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,599
Now this "not" is no longer used as a word.

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,459
but we can still see it in other words.

20
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,219
Note, again, the spelling in the old spelling.

21
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,019
some, some and so on.

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,019
and in all such cases the "not" will be a stressed syllable.

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,359
Where did this "not" come from?

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,959
it comes from the conjunction of the pre-Slavic nyy e, i.e. literally no is not there

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,339
the word indicates the absence of something in some place

26
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:14,559
Compare similar expressions in other languages.

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:26,229
here's an example of such an independent not from the old russian text

28
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:34,809
others may object how can we sometimes say in colloquial speech you have some things to do for tomorrow not

29
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,329
that it's possible, but somehow it seems to me that it's more of a situational neologization.

30
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,799
short for no or no-ah, but that second one probably has the ancient "not" in it.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,999
next

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,359
finally, let's talk about the word "no."

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,679
it comes from a combination of the same "not" and "tu"

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,779
tu is Old Russian for "here", "here".

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:06,849
compare, this word still has this form in Polish

36
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:14,199
so, although the word "no" did not yet exist in Proto-Slavonic, at that level it would be arranged into as many as three words

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,059
ne et tu

38
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,519
and, as we can easily guess, in early Old Russian no-tu sounded rather redundant

39
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,539
as if now instead of "I don't have time" we say "I don't have time here".

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,499
and we wouldn't be talking about a specific place where I don't have time.

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,899
Now about the word "no".

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,439
Again, it's not "no" that comes from "no", it's the other way around.

43
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,059
that is, at some point the final vowel of the word no began to fall off

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,679
and that's why it happened.

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,319
there was a phonetic change in the late Old Russian language

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:57,249
the rule of it was.

47
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,009
that's why our case endings didn't fall off.

48
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:26,399
eye eye about eye, but some other grammatical indicators changed their form

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,439
the remaining elements were sufficient to show the corresponding morphemes

50
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,679
Also in the word no, the final "t"

51
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,099
allowed us to keep the difference with the word "not".

52
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,639
if we look at the corpus of Old Russian texts, we see that there no strongly predominates over no

53
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,639
of course the historical corpus of Roskorpora is very small, but still it can give some relative figures

54
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,639
so in the Old Russian texts there no occurs 15 times and no

55
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,019
only two

56
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,179
I have an assumption that by the end of the Old Russian period more was spoken

57
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,399
Exactly no.

58
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,779
I'll explain why later.

59
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,559
and no occurs more often in the texts because it was supported by a certain written tradition.

60
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,059
but this is not known for certain, as you understand.

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:52,599
nevertheless, here are some examples of the word no from old russian texts.

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:05,219
here's an example for the word no

63
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,019
the development of negations does not end with the word no.

64
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,159
there is one word which now seems terribly rustic to us.

65
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,519
although it, too, originated in the early Old Russian language

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,259
this word

67
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,659
netuti or netut

68
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,419
as discerning viewers may have already guessed

69
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,199
it was the word netuti that first appeared which was later shortened to netut

70
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,819
by the same rule as no in no.

71
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,339
the ti on the end is another reinforcing word, a reinforcing particle

72
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:47,288
which was also once used separately, for example in birch bark writings.

73
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:56,109
it turns out that the word no-ti at the Proto-Slavonic level was divided into four words: pe-e tu ti

74
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:04,659
examples of its use in Old Russian texts

75
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:13,329
in this example it is not netut' at all, but nitut with this dialectal reflex.

76
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,259
So, what happens closer to our time

77
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,919
well, the word netuti is hardly used anymore by the 18th century.

78
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,619
it's an element to convey the speech of highly illiterate characters, but the words no and no are alive and well.

79
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,239
It's true.

80
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,779
the word no is much rarer than no.

81
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,519
So in the Russian Academy Dictionary of 1789.

82
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,299
the word "no" is not written out at all, but the word "no" is there, and it refers us to the dictionary entry "is."

83
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,879
so "no" is treated there as a form of the verb "to be".

84
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,739
and if we look in the same corpus, we see

85
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:59,199
that in the 18th and 19th centuries, the word "no" was used about 3,700 times.

86
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,459
While no has only 390 occurrences, that is, no was used almost 10 times more often

87
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,089
than no.

88
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:15,969
but also 390 occurrences are not a joke and of course we must not forget about 1700 occurrences of the 20th century.

89
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,549
Now let's talk about the meaning of the word

90
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,019
The curious thing is that in today's language the word no can be used in two meanings

91
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,419
as the absence of something and as a negative answer to a question.

92
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,979
the word "no" in its second meaning already sounds strange.

93
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,619
- Are you busy tomorrow?

94
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,439
- No.

95
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,259
We don't say that anymore.

96
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,619
but we used to be able to say that.

97
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,939
I looked through the corpus, and it was not until the 1930s and 40s that the word disappeared altogether.

98
00:08:41,940 --> 00:09:32,759
but even before that, it was quite rare.

99
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,039
Now let's talk about the stylistics of the word no.

100
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,579
Well, as for its meaning as a negative answer.

101
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,319
there can be no doubt that in the 19th century it wasn't neutral.

102
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,639
it was somewhere down in the stylistic register

103
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,439
because everywhere it's used, it's the speech of some not very literate characters

104
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,359
but for the word no meaning, we don't see that pattern.

105
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,059
Yes, you can find different examples, including stylistically colored

106
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:07,839
But there are also examples where the word "no" is neutral in general, and is used in the speech of obviously educated people

107
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:40,739
here is an example from Herzen, only here it is direct speech not by Herzen himself, but by his fellow revolutionary Kelsiev

108
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,119
The Soviet dictionaries weren't really so much against the word no.

109
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,459
it was just classified as colloquial.

110
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,199
so it was still within the literary language.

111
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,439
which is much better for the fate of the word than if it had been called

112
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,959
colloquialism or dialectism.

113
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:06,669
this is what Ozhegov says in his dictionary

114
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,739
so all these radical statements that you've probably all heard

115
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,759
that there's no word for "no" in the Russian language

116
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,779
is just the chatter of those who have decided to learn literary norms

117
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,819
but haven't done it enough.

118
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,679
or it's just an unfortunate pedagogical technique of Russian teachers

119
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,779
It might be easier for them to make a student once and for all

120
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,719
to get him to drop some dirty word out of his head once and for all.

121
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,759
that God forbid he didn't spit it out at the exam than to explain the various subtleties of its use

122
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,899
Now let's talk about the word "no" in our time, in the 21st century.

123
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,899
Gramota.ru and other reference resources still reprint Soviet dictionaries,

124
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,109
which say that "no" is a colloquial word and that's it.

125
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:56,339
but the corpus shows us that nowadays we can hardly call "no" a colloquial word.

126
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,379
We will omit examples from written texts for the sake of brevity.

127
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,699
We'll only give something from the multimedia corpus.

128
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,779
About biology, nothing is the same. No two individuals are alike

129
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,739
No two people are the same, it is impossible that they are different now that there is no alliance of right-wing forces.

130
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,229
the business trip is over and

131
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,659
the fundamental limit on agricultural productivity even with a doubling of

132
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,859
of the world's population there are very small black holes

133
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,489
microscopic black holes which appear in the theory of quantum gravity, whether they exist or not.

134
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,079
we don't know

135
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,699
they don't reflect what I'm saying is the syntax of the language.

136
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,379
but there is no complex no context

137
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,119
by which this gesture is realized

138
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,779
Sergei Udaltsov is under house arrest

139
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:57,079
and for the last few months he's been under it, he's gone.

140
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,739
There's no Google, there's no Mail.

141
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,439
We use different sources. We naturally search the corpus.

142
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,259
but it's a little small for these needs, a lot of the words aren't there.

143
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,699
there are no solutions and no prospects for evolution within this paradigm.

144
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,179
Unfortunately, we have very few contacts inside Georgia and practically none.

145
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:31,119
We have no ideas and no stereotype that life is beautiful.

146
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,519
Why hasn't the word no gone away and been completely replaced by the word no?

147
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,919
on the one hand, the word no

148
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,539
has a specific meaning: there is no object, but the word no in this sense has many meanings

149
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,079
so sometimes it might be better to say no for accuracy.

150
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,279
But on the other hand, I have another suggestion.

151
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,899
why no is still in the Russian language

152
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,819
it explains well why the word no seems to be more ancient than no

153
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,779
is still in the colloquial vocabulary,

154
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,339
and not somewhere high up there, and why it's now expanding its use

155
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,899
and the answer is simple.

156
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,919
no is one syllable and no is two.

157
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,479
the longer the word, the more expressive it is, and usually the more expressive it is,

158
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,159
and when it comes to the expressiveness and expressiveness of negatives.

159
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,839
there's a general linguistic pattern that comes into play.

160
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,579
You've ever had someone say "I didn't like it" and you hear "I liked it".

161
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,739
and then you ask them if they liked it or didn't like it.

162
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:44,929
to avoid this, speakers try to say things so that they can be understood unambiguously, and for this we need expressive intensifiers.

163
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,359
what we've seen in the history of the Russian language

164
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,229
at first it was just "neh", then it was no longer enough, so they started saying "neh" and it merged into "not".

165
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,169
that also became insufficient. They started saying no, no, and then that also became insufficient.

166
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,799
they invented words like no-tie and no-touchy.

167
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,459
That is, they add an expressive amplifier to a word, and then its expressive power weakens.

168
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,299
they add another word, and then this new formation

169
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:19,839
the overall expressive power weakens, a third word is needed, and so the words can be strung on top of each other ad infinitum.

170
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,679
examples from other languages

171
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,479
Latin has the word non, which translates to Russian no.

172
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,799
non comes from the abbreviation ne eounum "not one".

173
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,899
hence the Italian negation e.g. io non dico I don't speak

174
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:42,109
another example, in Old French there used to be a common-looking negation say in the modern pronunciation of something like

175
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,749
je ne sais, that is, I don't know.

176
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,849
then it came to be understood as

177
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:53,328
insufficient, not too expressive, and so that the interlocutor understands exactly what you don't know at all.

178
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:57,879
the French at some point began to add pas (step) to the end.

179
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,539
in the modern language I don't know would be je ne sais pas, as if "I don't know a step".

180
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,039
compare it to the Russian "not a drop".

181
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,519
later this construction became compulsory and we can't omit this pas in modern french anymore - it would be a mistake.

182
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,759
but you can omit ne and you get je sais pas, it's such a good construction of colloquial language

183
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,879
and a similar process where the amplifier completely replaces the negation and the former negation can disappear from the language altogether

184
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,609
it's called the Espersen cycle, you can read an interesting article about it.

185
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,879
Another example is perhaps the most mind-boggling.

186
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:44,086
in German, negation is done by nicht, which comes after the verb.

187
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,846
in modern German there's still a word der Wicht with a similar meaning.

188
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:53,166
but the word nio itself was never made up of two words, ni and io.

189
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:57,366
ni is just a common Old German negation, like the Russian not.

190
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,486
but io meant "always".

191
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:11,459
so if you break it down on a very ancient level, then sie wartet nicht would be "she's not always waiting for a creature".

192
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,578
which words were used at different times to reinforce

193
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,899
the expressiveness of the expression and

194
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,739
see how these words didn't really change its meaning

195
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,338
one last thing: the English word not shares completely the history of the German word nicht

196
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:36,019
in Middle English the word not was spelled like this, and in Old English it was noht from the older

197
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,459
nowiht

198
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,019
and as discerning onlookers will already guess when modern English speakers say nope instead of no

199
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,219
they are driven by the same linguistic process.

200
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,499
as we've seen in all kinds of languages, negation over time grows into different

201
00:17:51,500 --> 00:18:04,339
expressive intensifiers, either individual words or some simple sounds, like in English nope or in Russian nope.

202
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,339
the word no comes from the word no, not the other way around, as most people think.

203
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,219
all long negatives no, nooo, neti arose as early as in Old Russian to replace the usual ne

204
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,739
the word no to has two meanings, like the word no now

205
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,019
the first meaning still remains to this day (no something) and the second, the answer to the negation, we no longer say

206
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,179
we don't say you want to drink no, but we won't say it that way. This second meaning of the word no has already started to disappear at the beginning of the 20th century.

207
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:40,499
and apparently it's always had a colloquial connotation, but the first meaning of nooo has never been colloquial.

208
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,219
the word no was just used in its first meaning ten times less often than no.

209
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,899
and even Soviet dictionaries only give it the label colloquial.

210
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,859
that is, it stays within the literary language.

211
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,779
although now the word no is extending its use in registers and it is probably not very correct to say that the word is purely

212
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:04,459
colloquial and one of the reasons why it happens is the great length of the word no and therefore its great expressiveness

213
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,179
probably more expressive.

214
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,500
Well, brothers and sisters, goodbye for now.
