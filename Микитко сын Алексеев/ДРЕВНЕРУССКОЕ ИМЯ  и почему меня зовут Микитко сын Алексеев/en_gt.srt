00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,559
Hello!

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,539
First of all, this video, of course, is of a historical and philological nature:

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,839
how the Old Russian names were arranged.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,319
But I also want to tell you some autobiographical nuance:

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,539
why my name is Mikitka, the son of Alekseev.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,979
According to my passport, I am Nikita Alekseevich, but I came up with the idea of calling myself Mikitka, the son of Alekseev, back in the tenth grade, this 

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,319
s one of the forms of the Russian folk name.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,699
 That was the name of all our ancestors two hundred, three hundred, four hundred years ago.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,139
Well, all our humble ancestors.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,259
Since I donâ€™t have an aristocracy in my family at all, such a name just suits me.

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,619
The first reason why I abandoned the name Nikita and took Mikitko

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,939
is that now we have become painfully cool, and almost all of us have

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,999
Church Slavonic forms of our names in our Soviet-era passports.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,539
For everyone in Ancient Russia, and among the people until the 20th century,

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,099
full church forms of names were used very limitedly.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,899
A person could have two completely different names: one - a pagan, Slavic, for example, household name:

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,839
Tretiak, Bazhen, Nechay (hence such surnames as Tretyakov, Bazhenov, Nechaev);

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,259
and another name - baptismal: Timothy, Boris, George.

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,179
And it is clear that at first the church name was left for special occasions, for religion;

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:22,619
he was often hidden from strangers, and in ordinary life everyone knew the person under his popular name.

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,139
If a person already had only one name, a church one

22
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,039
(well, in the later era it was more often the case),

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,019
then he still had many forms:

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,839
one of them was Church Slavonic in appearance, others, a large number of them, were

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,059
Old Russian, that is, folk.

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,419
Let's say it's just nonsense for some peasant woman to be called Elizabeth:

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,499
only Lizaveta, Liza, Lizanka, and so on;

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,739
or Elena: only Alena, Lena and so on;

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,279
or the potter's name was Daniel: only Danilo, Danil, Danilko and so on;

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,119
or Theodore: only Fedor, Khvyodor, Fedko, Fedya and others.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,459
An interesting story already from the 20th century: my grandmother had two cousins, and they lived in Klintsy,

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,219
and their parents moved from the village to the city.

33
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,019
So, everyone - all relatives, all friends, acquaintances - all of them were called only

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,039
Lyolya and Talka.

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,219
Grandmother says that she found out the real names of the sisters only when she was already over twenty,

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,339
well, she saw some documents there,

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,679
and they were called by the passport - what do you think?  -

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,719
Elena and Natalia.

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,139
Grandmother said that it just shocked her then, it didnâ€™t even occur to her

40
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,599
that Talka and Lyolya - well, these are some kind of colloquial forms, and it just seemed to her that, well, such rare names, yes ...

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,979
Please note  that in ancient times, folk forms did not sound childish, rustic, insulting, dismissive;

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,319
they were also often used by adults and respected people.

43
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,039
Names such as Gavrilo, Sudilo, Yanko, Milko, Miloshko, Fedko could be used in letters

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,779
in relation to a merchant, a boyar, and even a bishop.

45
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,439
So, in the Nikon chronicle under 1171,

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,139
the death of the posadnik Vasily Buslaev is mentioned,

47
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,779
and he is called "Vaska Buslavich".

48
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,059
There were other posadniks, for example, Peter and Miroslav, who are named Petrila and Miroshka.

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,259
And even Prince Vsevolod is sometimes mentioned in the annals as Vsevolodok.

50
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,379
Or, pay attention, the well-known Old Russian text is called

51
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,759
"Questioning Kirikovo", well, or a variant of "Kurikovo",

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,059
and Kirik is not Kirill!  - it was a respected person, a

53
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,239
mathematician, a thinker, a monk.

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,739
Exactly the same thing happened with other Slavs:

55
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,659
some diminutive forms completely replaced the original names.

56
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:48,479
Take that South Slavic - Ivanko, Mirko, Branko, Goiko, that Polish - Leszek, Jacek, Frantisek, Marek:

57
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,459
everywhere we see diminutive forms.

58
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,439
The name of the first Polish prince, the baptizer of Poland, for a minute!  - Meshko.

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,739
That is, it is a folk form from the full name "Mechislav".

60
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,379
It's the same as if we called our baptist

61
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,879
Volodya.

62
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,659
A radical change took place in Muscovite Russia.

63
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,059
On the one hand, in the culture of the then society,

64
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,359
there was a demand for such linguistic means through which one class

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,278
can show dominance over another.

66
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,359
On the other hand, it was also necessary to show Christian humility.

67
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,879
This is how the oldest Slavic tradition was represented by meanness and self-abasement.

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,359
Then it became obligatory for a superior person to call himself the so-called "half-name".

69
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,199
The superior himself was honored to be addressed in full, ecclesiastical form.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,019
This rule was canceled by a special decree only by Peter in 1702,

71
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,819
and before that, the serf peasant Andrei was Andreika for the clerk,

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,259
but for the tsar, the boyar Andrei was also Andreika.

73
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,579
In turn, the superiors themselves eventually began to call the niello

74
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,299
only folk forms,

75
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,859
but for people equal in their position, the

76
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,459
diminutive form was not offensive or derogatory.

77
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,039
On the contrary, she sounded friendly and familiar,

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,919
ordinary people always communicated with each other like that.

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,279
Although for a person of a different status, this would sound familiar:

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,439
"He is not Dimon to you!"

81
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,339
Russian folklore also often uses diminutive forms

82
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,719
in such a good-natured, positive meaning.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,919
So, in epics, the heroes Vaska Buslaev or Dobrynushka Mikitinets are often sung about,

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,479
or in songs about Stepan Razin, the forms "Stenka" or "Senka" predominate.

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,079
But, on the other hand, you can also meet negative characters, for example,

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,339
Kudrevanko, Tsar Kudrevanovich.

87
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,519
Why at the end "o" and not "a"

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,659
Now Slavic names with "-o" have become very rare in Russia,

89
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,279
although they are still common in Ukraine:

90
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,719
Gavrilo, Petro, Yurko, Pavlo and others.

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,259
We have them, if they exist somewhere - well, at least in the culture of the last centuries -

92
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,619
this is mainly in the Russian north, where there is an okane.

93
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,439
The same Mikhailo Lomonosov.  Or also connoisseurs of North Russian folklore

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,779
know the old "Vavilo and buffoons" for sure.

95
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,239
Suppose Gavrila Ardalionovich in Dostoevsky's The Idiot is written through A.

96
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,919
Or the impostor Grishka Otrepyev.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,719
We also just have names Yurka, Sasha, Petka, and not Yurko, Sashko, Petko.

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,919
Danila Cross through A, although the older form is on O,

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,859
compare: BG has the song "Ivan and Danilo",

100
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,699
or Letov's song in the text says:

101
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,479
"How blind Ivashka ran after the sun",

102
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,719
but the name of a linguofreak known to many of our viewers is  Ivashko.

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,719
But in the 18th and 19th centuries, probably because of akanya, all masculine words beginning with "-o"

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,019
began to be declined like words beginning with "-a".

105
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,339
That is, it also affected cities, such as "Vilna", "Kovno" became "Vilna", "Kovna";

106
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,939
This also affected Ukrainian surnames,

107
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,859
that is, if earlier they were "Shevchenko", "Shevchenko", "Shevchenko",

108
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,399
then they became "Shevchenko", "Shevchenko", "Shevchenko",

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,659
at the beginning of the 20th century, in general, their declination became non-literary,

110
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,739
well  and the same process happened with names beginning with "-o" like Mikhailo, Mikitko, Gavrilo.

111
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,299
That is, the spelling "-o" remains, and the word is inclined differently for a long time.

112
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,859
The second reason why I abandoned the name "Nikita"

113
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,679
For most foreigners, including Poles, it sounds feminine.

114
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,039
Male names with "-a" for other peoples are generally rare,

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,579
so all our Pashas, Sashas, Petyas, Yuras sound very feminine for most foreigners, and the nam

116
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,639
 "Nikita" is doubly unlucky: it does no

117
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,879
t have a full form for a consonant,  this is on

118
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,059
and two - in the West it is well known precisely as a female name,

119
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,859
this was facilitated by the film "Her name was Nikita".

120
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,539
I once asked a Pole who did not know about my channel

121
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,719
what his associations are with two names:

122
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,579
Nikita and Mikitko.

123
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,699
He immediately said to Nikita that it sounded feminine,

124
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,099
and to Mikitka he replied that it sounds strange,

125
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,699
it seems that this is the name of someone from the east (meaning - from the Eastern Slavs),

126
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,179
moreover, it seems somewhat outdated,

127
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,439
he added that  he would not be surprised to come across such a name, let us say, in a novel by Sienkiewicz.

128
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,559
Well, I thought that this is probably one of the most successful associations

129
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,679
that can arise for my name,

130
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,659
so, at least for the Polish audience, it is well chosen.

131
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,519
Yes, yes, I also heard that there is something Japanese in the name

132
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,058
Mikitko, but I have already decided to close my eyes to these associations.

133
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,499
Why M and not H at the Beginning

134
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,459
These two sounds often change into one another in Slavic languages,

135
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,918
because both are nasal consonants.

136
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,259
Hence such a form of the name Nikolai as Mikolay or Mikola,

137
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,239
in Novgorod letters there are such forms of the name Nikifor as Mikifor or Mikiforko,

138
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,259
in the northern Russian epic one sings about the hero Dobrynushka Mikitinets.

139
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,059
Why a patronymic and not a surname

140
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,799
Firstly, I didnâ€™t want to shine with my full name, and now I donâ€™t want to,

141
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,419
secondly, my surname is quite common,

142
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,799
I personally met in my life as many as two of my namesakes by name and surname,

143
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,639
it is obvious that in  there would be even more of them on the Internet, and it would be quite difficult to find me.

144
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,759
And thirdly,

145
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,519
before most people, except for the nobility, did not have surnames, there

146
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,859
were only patronymics and nicknames.

147
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,699
Well, just as until now, suppose, the

148
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,499
Icelanders do not have surnames, a country with a population of more than three hundred thousand;

149
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,479
at this point, globalization has not affected them.

150
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,219
Itâ€™s not without reason that my patronymic sounds like a surname,

151
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,819
because most of our surnames come from ancient Russian patronymics:

152
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,459
whose son?  - Ivanov, Petrov, Fedorov, Vasiliev, Dmitriev.

153
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,879
Please note that this naming was also not purely common people

154
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,479
, even the princes used it.

155
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,879
For example, in one chronicle of the end of the 12th century it says:

156
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,359
"... repose Mstislav son Rostislavl, and grandson Gyurgev".

157
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,279
This refers to the Novgorod prince Mstislav the Brave.

158
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,659
Or in another chronicle, later:

159
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:16,819
"The Great Prince Vsevolod, the son of Gyurgev, the grandson of Volodymyrov Monomakhov, his son Yaroslav, sent to Pereyaslavl."

160
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,199
As historians now call this prince, I think itâ€™s understandable,

161
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,239
because the grandfatherâ€™s nickname is presented.

162
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,339
The full title of "The Tale of Igor's Campaign" is

163
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:38,699
"The Tale of Igor's Campaign, Igor's Son of Svyatoslav, Grandson of Olga."

164
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,659
So, I remember, I once amused my art history teacher,

165
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,599
then, in the tenth grade, when I had just seen such a name format in the annals,

166
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,979
I signed my test work

167
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,939
"Mikitko, son of Alekseev, grandson of Ivanov, great-grandson of Vasiliev."

168
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:02,139
There are also ancient princely charters with such signatures, let's say, a

169
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,379
charter around 1130, and

170
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,359
"Behold everything gave Varlam Mikhalev son", a

171
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,219
charter around 1192.

172
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,619
At the same time, many scribe books with such forms of names

173
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,659
were kept until the 18th-19th centuries, well, of course, mostly

174
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,299
people of simple origin were already recorded there.

175
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,299
Suppose, "Marchko and Fadeyko Nekrasov's children; Miroshko Tretyakov's son;

176
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,039
Danilko Menshikov's son; Kornilko Bazhenov's son" and others.

177
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,279
Many of the people we know supposedly by last

178
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,339
name didn't actually have a last name.

179
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,239
So, for the first printer Ivan Fedorov, Fedorov is a patronymic, not a surname.

180
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,639
He also often signed "Ivan Fedorov son Moskvitin",

181
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,999
that is, his first name, patronymic and nickname.

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,779
Also, patronymics, but not the surnames of the traveler Afanasy Nikitin or the militiaman Kuzma Minin.

183
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,439
Why "son of Alekseev" and not "son of Alekseev"

184
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,619
As you can see, I also had a choice of word order.

185
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,699
Moreover, the second type - Alekseev's son - nevertheless met in real texts much more often.

186
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,999
But this is not surprising: this word order is natural for the Russian language.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,499
And then, imagine, it would be like the Irish:

188
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,339
McCarthy, McDonald, McGrath ...

189
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,099
But I chose "son of Alekseev", and here's why:

190
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,559
firstly, if "Mikitko Alekseev's son" is written,

191
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,599
then it is more likely that the latter  the word will simply be discarded, they will

192
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,479
say "Mikitko Alekseev", as this, in fact, happened in general in the history of the Russian name,

193
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,279
and ... then all the flavor disappears.

194
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,839
Secondly, the word "son" in fluent speech often loses emphasis,

195
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,699
and if it is "Mikitko son Alekseev" - this is normal,

196
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,919
but if it is "Mikitka Alekseev son", then with fuzzy pronunciation the question involuntarily arises:

197
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,619
"Who-who-who  "Alekseevson?"

198
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,899
Well, then two associations:

199
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,279
either this is a Scandinavian surname, which is unlikely in our area,

200
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,279
or, God forbid, Jewish!

201
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,159
[irony]

202
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,219
And thirdly, if the word "son" is at the end, then we get a rhythmically uneven combination:

203
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,459
"Mikitko Alekseev son" - well, three unstressed syllables at the end is a lot.

204
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,259
Results

205
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,599
Despite the fact that I used to call myself "Mikitka son of Alekseev" for quite a long time,

206
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,259
this old Russian flavor is no longer so important for me,

207
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,839
as it was at the age of 17,

208
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,659
I still think that the choice of the name was successful.

209
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,279
This sounds unique;

210
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,819
you can just call me by my name, and it's immediately clear who you are talking about.

211
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,059
It's called a mononym.

212
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,799
That is, when a person is known exclusively by name and there is no need to specify his

213
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,359
last name, patronymic, nicknames, origin, profession, and so on.

214
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,999
And who in our Russian culture can even boast of such a thing?

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,499
Ermak, Nikon, Avvakum, Nestor

216
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,199
(unless you mean the author of this moronic channel on Youtube, which has recently been hyped),

217
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,179
or - the female names are mostly singers -

218
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,879
Zemfira, Pelageya, Alsu ...

219
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,499
well, perhaps that's all.

220
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,759
Game I

221
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,379
suggest you, brothers, dear sisters, think about

222
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,059
what your name would be if you lived only three or four hundred years ago.

223
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,339
Write the resulting options in the comments, maybe someone will come up with a very beautiful combination.

224
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,019
First you need to take your name in folk form.

225
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,599
If you donâ€™t know, see how it looks in Ukrainian,

226
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,979
or check Wikipedia, there are different options.

227
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,639
Remember: there will always be many options, and that's okay.

228
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,699
Then you can add the diminutive suffix "-k", and for the masculine ending

229
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,899
, "-o" is preferable, for the feminine - "-a",

230
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,399
however, if you don't want it, your name already sounds very dashing,

231
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,019
then you can not do this  .

232
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,939
Then add the word "son" or "daughter"

233
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,499
(depending on your gender).

234
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,039
Next, take your middle name according to the type of surname on "-ov", "-ev", "-yn", "-in".

235
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,719
Please note that since this is your father's name,

236
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,459
there should not be a diminutive suffix

237
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,819
so that the endowment suffix does not change in the end.

238
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,839
So that from Sergeev you do not become "Sergeikin",

239
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,919
and from Timofeev - "Timofeykin";

240
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,299
let's leave such amusing forms to the

241
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,819
clerks of Muscovite Russia.

242
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,839
Well, some examples:

243
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,199
Alexandra Kirillovna - Sasha, daughter of Kirikov,

244
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,479
Gleb Petrovich - Glebko, son of Petrov,

245
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,539
Philip Sergeevich - Pilip, son of Sergeev,

246
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,599
Maria Fedorovna - Marya, daughter of Fedorov,

247
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,859
Nikolai Georgievich, Mikolko, son of Gyurgev,

248
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,259
Daria Alexandrovna, Dasha, daughter of Alexandrov,

249
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,859
Mikhail Alekseevich, Mikhailo, son of Alekseev  .

250
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,779
And on that, brothers, dear sisters,

251
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,500
goodbye for now.
