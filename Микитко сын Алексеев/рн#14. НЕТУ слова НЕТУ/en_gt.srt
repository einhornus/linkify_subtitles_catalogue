1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,219
you can often hear that there is no word supposedly

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,779
no

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,388
, what those who say this really don’t have is a linguistic instinct,

4
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:14,199
so let’s free our native language from the prison of Rosenthal

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,929
and find out why there is no better word no, how it was used in the past and how it  they use now

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:37,719
and most importantly - why does the language even need such long denials as no or even netuti

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,889
against the background of genuine knowledge, it’s a bit ridiculous to hear that no is a distorted word no,

8
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,619
and this knowledge lies in the fact that no no comes from no, but vice versa,

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,159
but we  we won’t understand today’s speech nuance if we don’t also consider other denials in the history of the Russian language,

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,079
let’s start with the simplest, it’s the shortest,

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,159
this negative particle “not”

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,339
this word goes back to the Proto-Indo-European times, if not even more ancient

13
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:20,279
and it is approximately the same  sounds in most European languages, then from there there is this root, but

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,379
then the word appears in the Proto-Slavic do not

15
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,159
pay attention here already long voices  nye "e"

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,179
then it became the sound "ie" in the Old Russian language, that is, "I team"

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,759
which was reflected in the old spelling until 1918 and then again just a short "e"

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,599
now such "not" as a separate word is no longer used

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,459
but  we can still see in the composition of other words,

20
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,219
pay attention again to the spelling in the old spelling of

21
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,019
someone, some, and so on,

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,019
and in all such cases, "not" will be a stressed syllable,

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,359
where did this "not" come from?

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,959
it comes from the combination of the Proto-Slavic nas, that is, there is literally no there is no

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,339
word indicates the absence of something in some place

26
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:14,559
compare similar phrases in other languages

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:26,229
xample of such an independent text not from Old Russian, others may 

28
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:34,809
bject to us, well, how can you  sometimes say in colloquial speech let's say you have some business for tomorrow, not

29
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,329
what is possible, and so, but for some reason it seems to me that this is rather such a situational neoplasm, an

30
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,799
abbreviation for no or no, but in this second it is more likely  there really is an ancient “not” of everything,

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,999
then

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,359
finally we’ll talk about the word “no”

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,679
it comes from a combination of the same “not” and “tu”

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,779
that is in Old Russian “here”, “here”

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:06,849
compare, this word still has  such a form in the Polish language

36
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:14,199
in this way, although the word "no" did not yet exist in the Proto-Slavic, at that level it would be decomposed into three words

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,059
no no no

38
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,519
and, as you might guess, in the early Old Russian period no sounded quite redundant

39
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,539
as if m  you just said instead of “I don’t have time” “I don’t have time here”

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,499
and it wouldn’t be about a specific place where exactly I don’t have time

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,899
now about the word “no”

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,439
I repeat once again that not “no” comes from  “no”, but on the contrary,

43
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,059
that is, at some point, the final vowel began to fall off the word,

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,679
and this happened, which is why

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:04:00,009
in the late Old Russian language there was one

46
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:26,399
phonetic change;  but some other grammatical indicators of the remaining elements changed their appearance

47
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,439
was enough to show the corresponding morphemes

48
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,679
also for the word no, the final "tъ"

49
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,099
allowed us to maintain a difference with the word "not"

50
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,639
if we look into the corpus of Old Russian texts, we will see that there strongly prevails over no

51
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,639
of course, the historical corpus of Roscorporation is very small, but still it can give some relative figures,

52
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,639
so in ancient Russian texts it doesn’t meet 15 times, but no, I

53
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,019
only

54
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,179
have two  the assumption that by the end of the Old Russian period they already said

55
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,399
exactly no,

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,779
I will later explain why

57
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,559
but no is more common in texts because it was supported by some kind of written tradition,

58
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,059
but, as you understand,

59
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:52,599
this is not known for certain; nevertheless, here are some examples of the word no from ancient Russian texts

60
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:05,219
here is an example for the word no

61
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,019
further the development of negations on the word no does not end

62
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,159
there is one word that now seems terribly rustic to us

63
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,519
although it also arose in the early Old Russian language

64
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,259
this word is

65
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,659
netuti or netut

66
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,419
as perceptive viewers could already guess

67
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,199
it was the words netuti that first appeared which then  abbreviated to netut

68
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,819
according to the same rule, according to which there is no in no,

69
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,339
here it is, at the end, this is another amplifying word, an amplifying particle

70
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:47,288
that was also once used separately, for example, in birch bark it

71
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:56,109
turns out that the word netuti at the Proto-Slavic level was laid out as much as  four words ne je tu ti

72
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:04,659
examples of its use in  Old Russian texts

73
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:13,329
here in this example do not exist at all, but a thread with such a dialectal reflex.

74
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,259
So, what happens closer to our time,

75
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,919
well, the word netuti is almost never used by the 18th century, wherever it occurs later

76
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,619
it is such an element for conveying the speech of highly illiterate characters and  here are the words no and no, live and live,

77
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,239
yes, the

78
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,779
word no is much less common than no,

79
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,519
so in the dictionary of the Russian Academy of 1789 the

80
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,299
word "no" is not written out at all, but there is the word "no" and it refers us to the dictionary entry "is"

81
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,879
that is, “no” is considered there as a form of the verb “to be”,

82
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,739
and if we look in the same corpus, we will see

83
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:59,199
that during the 18-19 centuries the word “no” appeared in texts about 3700 times,

84
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:07,089
while there are only 390  occurrences, that is, no, it was used almost 10 times more often than none,

85
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:15,969
but 390 occurrences are not jokes and, of course, we should not forget about another 1700 occurrences in the 20th century,

86
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,549
now let's talk about the meaning of the word a

87
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,019
curious moment that in the modern language the word no can have  to be consumed in two meanings

88
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,419
as the absence of something and as a negative answer to the question, the

89
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,979
word "no" in the second meaning already sounds strange

90
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,619
- Are you busy tomorrow?

91
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,439
-

92
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,259
No, we don’t say that anymore,

93
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,619
but earlier it could be said that

94
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,939
I looked through the corpus and such a meaning of the word disappears completely only in the 1930s and 40s,

95
00:08:41,940 --> 00:09:32,759
however, it was quite rare even before that,

96
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,039
now let’s talk about the style of the word no,

97
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,579
as for  its meaning as a negative answer,

98
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,319
then there can be no doubt that even in the 19th century such a meaning was not neutral;

99
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,639
it was somewhere lower in the stylistic register

100
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,439
, because wherever it is used, this is the speech of some not very literate characters,

101
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,359
but  we don’t observe the absence of such a picture for the word no,

102
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,059
yes, you can find various examples, including stylistically colored ones,

103
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:07,839
but there are also examples where the word no is generally neutral, it is used in the speech of clearly educated people,

104
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:40,739
here is an example from Herzen, only here it is  the direct speech is not of Herzen himself, but of his colleague revolutionary Kelsiev.

105
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,119
Soviet dictionaries in fact were not so much against the word no,

106
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,459
it was simply attributed to the colloquial style

107
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,199
that is, it was still within the framework of the literary language,

108
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,439
it is much better for the fate of the word than if it were called

109
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,959
vernacular or dialectism

110
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:06,669
, that's what Ozhegov writes in his dictionary,

111
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,739
so all these radical statements that you probably all heard

112
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,759
that there are no words in Russian  no,

113
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,779
it’s just the chatter of those who decided to become more adept at literary norms,

114
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,819
but they didn’t do it clearly enough,

115
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,679
or it’s just such an unsuccessful pedagogical technique for Russian language teachers

116
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,779
, because it can be easier to make a schoolboy once and for all

117
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,719
throw out of his head some such word with a trick

118
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,759
that  he, God forbid, did not give it away in the exam rather than explaining the various subtleties of its use,

119
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,899
now let's talk about the word "no" now quite in our time, that is, in the 21st century,

120
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,899
Gramota.ru and other reference resources are still reprinting Soviet dictionaries,

121
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,109
where  it is said that no this is a colloquial word and that's it,

122
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:56,339
but the corpus shows us that now the word no can be called colloquial only with very much  For the

123
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,379
sake of brevity, we will omit examples from written texts by a big stretch, we will cite a lot of them,

124
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,699
only something from the multimedia corpus

125
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,779
about biology, nothing is the same.  There are no two identical individuals,

126
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,739
there are no two identical people, it’s impossible, they are somehow different now that there is no alliance of right-wing forces, the

127
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,229
business trip is over and there is no

128
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,659
fundamental limitation on agricultural productivity, even with doubling

129
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,859
the world’s population, these are very small black holes,

130
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:38,079
microscopic black holes that arise in quantum theory  gravity, that is, whether they are unknown or not,

131
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,699
they do not reflect what I say, the syntax of the language, that is, there are faces here,

132
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,379
but there is no complex, there are no contexts in

133
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,119
which this gesture is realized by

134
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,779
sergey udaltsov and has been under house arrest

135
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:57,079
and for the last few months that he has been under it

136
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,739
Google doesn’t, email doesn’t,

137
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,439
we use different sources, we naturally search in the corpus,

138
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,259
but it’s still too small for these needs, there are no solutions for many words,

139
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,699
and in general, there are no prospects and evolution within this paradigm

140
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,179
within Georgia, we have very few contacts, unfortunately, and  in practice, they can be said to be absent.

141
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:31,119
We have no ideas and a stereotype that life  it’s wonderful

142
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,519
why the word no has not yet gone away and has not been completely replaced by the word no,

143
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,919
on the one hand, the word no has a

144
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,539
specific meaning: the subject is absent, the word no is ambiguous in this sense,

145
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,079
therefore sometimes it may be better to say no for greater accuracy,

146
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,279
but with  on the other hand, I have one more suggestion

147
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,899
why no has not yet left the Russian language,

148
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,819
it explains well why the word no seems to be more ancient than no

149
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,779
is still kept precisely in the colloquial layer of the vocabulary,

150
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,339
and not somewhere in the high,  and why it is now just expanding its use

151
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,899
and the answer is simple

152
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,919
no, it’s one syllable, but no - two

153
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,479
the longer the word, the more expressive and usually more expressive it is,

154
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,159
and when it comes to expressiveness and expressiveness of

155
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,839
negations, a well-known general linguistic pattern comes into play

156
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,579
you've been like that.  that a person says “I didn’t like it”, and you hear “I liked it”

157
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,739
and then you ask again whether you liked it or didn’t like it in

158
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:44,929
order to avoid this, speakers strive to say so that they understand unequivocally, and for this we need expressive amplifiers

159
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,359
what we saw in the history of the Russian language

160
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,229
at first was  just “ne”, then it began to be missed, they began to say “nee”, it merged into “not”,

161
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,169
this also began to be missed, they began to say no, no, then it began to be missed, they

162
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,799
came up with such words as netut or netushki,

163
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,459
that is, expressive is added to the word  amplifier, then its expressiveness weakens

164
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,299
, one more word is added, then already in this neoplasm the

165
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:19,839
general expressiveness weakens, a third word is needed, and so words can be strung on top of each other indefinitely

166
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,679
examples from other languages

167
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,479
in there is a word non which is translated as Russian no non o

168
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,799
curs  from the abbreviation ne eounum "none"

169
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,899
hence the Italian negation e.g. io non dico

170
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:42,109
In the English language, there was once a normal-looking negation, I say in modern pronunciation something like

171
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,749
je ne sais, that is, I don’t know,

172
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,849
then it began to be perceived as

173
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:53,328
insufficient, not too expressive, and therefore so that the interlocutor would understand for sure that you didn’t understand something at all  you know, the

174
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:57,879
French at some point began to add pas (step) to the end

175
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,539
in the modern language, I don’t know it will be je ne sais pas, as if “I don’t know a single step”

176
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,039
well, compare with Russian “not a drop”

177
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,519
then such a construction completely became  obligatory and omitting this pas in modern French is no longer a mistake,

178
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,759
but you can omit ne, and you get je sais pas, such a good construction of the spoken language

179
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,879
and a similar process when the amplifier completely replaces the negation and the previous negation can generally disappear from the language

180
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,609
is called the Jespersen cycle  about this you can read one interesting article

181
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,879
another example, perhaps the most breathtaking

182
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:44,086
in the German language, the negation is made by the word nicht, which comes after the verb

183
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,846
in modern  German German still has the word der Wicht with a similar meaning,

184
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:53,166
but the word nio itself never consisted of two words ni and io

185
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:57,366
ni, this is just the usual Old High German negation as Russian, not

186
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,486
but io meant "always"

187
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:11,459
that is, if you lay it out at a very ancient level  then sie wartet nicht will be "she does not always wait for a creature"

188
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,578
what words were used at different times to enhance the

189
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,899
expressiveness of the expression and

190
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,739
we see how these words did not really change its meaning

191
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,338
and the last: the English word not completely shares the history of the German nicht

192
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:36,019
in the Middle English period the word not  it was written like this, and in Old English it was noht from the older

193
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,459
nowiht,

194
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,019
and as astute viewers already guess, when modern English speakers say nope instead of no,

195
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,219
they are driven by the same linguistic process

196
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,499
as we have seen in a variety of languages, denials over time acquire different

197
00:17:51,500 --> 00:18:04,339
expressive amplifiers  these are either individual words or some just sounds like in English nope or  in Russian, no, the

198
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,339
word no comes from the word no, and not vice versa, as many people think,

199
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,219
all long negatives no, no, netuti arose in the Old Russian language instead of the usual

200
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,739
word no, the word no used to have two meanings, just like the word no now the

201
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,019
first meaning is preserved until  until now (there is something missing) and the second, the answer in case of denial, we no

202
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,179
longer say that you want to drink no, but we won’t say that, this second meaning of the word no already began to disappear at the beginning of the 20th century

203
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:40,499
and apparently it always had a colloquial connotation, but the first  the meaning for the word no has never been vernacular; the

204
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,219
word no is simply used in the first meaning ten times less often than not

205
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,899
, and even Soviet dictionaries give it only a colloquial mark,

206
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,859
that is, it remains within the framework of the literary language,

207
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,779
although now the word no is expanding its use by registers and  it’s probably not very correct to say that this word is purely

208
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:04,459
colloquial and one of the reasons why this happens is the long length of the word is not present, and therefore its large expressive

209
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,179
perhaps greater expressiveness,

210
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,500
well, brothers, dear sisters, but on that, goodbye for now
