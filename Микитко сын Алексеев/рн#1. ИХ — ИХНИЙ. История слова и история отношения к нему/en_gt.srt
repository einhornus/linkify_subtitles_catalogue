00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,559
From school, we can remember that in Russian there are personal pronouns -

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,555
these are those that directly designate the one who performs the action.

3
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:14,529
These are words such as "I", "you", "we", "you", "he", "she", "it", "they".

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,729
And there are

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,459
possessive pronouns.  They name that whose object is: "mine", "your", "our", "your".

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,899
These words can change: "to mine", "your", "your", "your", "from ours".

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,499
However, from the words "he", "she", "it", "they"

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,019
possessive pronouns are

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,659
not formed.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:41,659
And the form "their" is not a possessive pronoun, but the plural genitive form

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,179
of the word "they".

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,079
That is, this is already a case form in itself, it cannot

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,339
change again in gender, number and case.
To correct this unfortunate misunderstanding

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,719
, some people add the suffix -n-

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,859
and the endings of possessive pronouns to this form.

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,459
This is how not only the word “theirs” appeared, but also “evony” and “eyny”.

"IKH" vs. "IKHNIY"

00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,139
History of the word

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,139
The first time in a written text in Russian the word "ikhniy" occurs as early

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,239
as 1595!

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,159
“That they beat us with their foreheads, and said that in the past, in the ninety-fourth year, they

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,619
took from them for us for the Siberian roads of their fathers their patrimony, town and prison.”

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,799
Almost 200 years later, a linguist speaks about this form for the first time.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,979
in 1788, the

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,539
scientist Barsov writes about this in the Russian Grammar.  He says that this form is

28
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,859
indeed widespread among the people, but nevertheless it is

29
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,919
colloquial and still "not accepted into general use."

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,259
However, throughout the 19th century, the frequency of use of this word is expanding and growing,

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,038
and it becomes more and more neutral.  Examples from the literature.

32
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,459
Griboyedov:

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,999
Is this your man?
- Theirs-s

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,519
Gogol:

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,239
"He went over to their side, he is now completely theirs."

36
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,259
Pay attention to how the author plays on style.  In one sentence

37
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,359
, both "their" and "theirs" are found.

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,839
Tolstoy:

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,579
“And so I keep everything;  and their German only smokes a pipe, and that’s all.

40
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,859
However, in all these early examples from literature, the word “theirs” is used by people of obviously

41
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,139
low education.  Those who do not speak the

42
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,039
literary language sufficiently.  This is a servant, a

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,999
Zaporozhye Jew, a batman.  Yes, this is a good technique for transmitting the speech of an

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,639
illiterate or rural population, but nothing more.

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,879
However, there was one lover of this word, who even put it into the mouths of

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,919
educated characters and even could write it himself.

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,059
“Kiss the kids, angels, my gods.  Yours and theirs are all F. Dostoevsky.

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,799
Of course, in his texts, Fyodor Mikhailovich wrote simply “them” dozens of times more often.

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,879
But for such a language game, sometimes it was possible to return a dashing folk word.

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,959
But by the beginning of the 20th century, even

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,399
serious people in serious texts without a blush on their faces could

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,219
use the word “theirs”.  And moreover, these are not some subtle words and acrobats of the pen,

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,779
these are people of completely different professions - not writers,

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,339
not philologists.  For example, Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev is a

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,679
chemist and scientist.  And Pyotr Alekseevich Kropotkin is a

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,159
revolutionary.

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,299
“However, our hopes that these young people would become propagandists among the rest of the

58
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,819
workers, whose situation is much worse than theirs, were not entirely justified.”

59
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,679
“Lithuania and Poland, for their numerous

60
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,499
pressures and on our country, paid with subjugation and division, because Russian realism is

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,959
higher and stronger than theirs from the Latin inspired beginnings.”

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,959
But the

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,679
Soviet power comes.

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,359
After all the vicissitudes of

65
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,159
language policy in the 1920s, in the

66
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,979
late 1930s, the

67
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,939
authorities came to a new conclusion - the language should be extremely rigidly standardized.

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,399
A lot of words with dictionary marks "colloquial", "reg.", "dial.", "simple."  are branded with disgrace.

69
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,939
School teachers, editors, compilers of dictionaries

70
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,479
deny them life.

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,279
And "theirs" falls into their number.

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,219
Whatever educational literature you open, it is written everywhere that “this is wrong”,

73
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,539
that “there are no such words”.  It's like something has changed!

74

How the word “THEHNIY” appeared

78
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,319
Here it is worth discarding the assumption that the appearance of the word “theirs” is a

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,279
Ukrainian influence.

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,239
"Їhniy" is a word in itself, which became widespread

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,239
only with the light hand of the Soviet rule-makers of the 20s.

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,459
Of course, this form existed before.  But firstly, it was not considered

83
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,099
literary, and secondly, it was not predominant.

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,439
Exactly the same can be said about the Belarusian language

85
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,659
with its forums "eyny", "yagony", "ihni".

86
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,559
Even less often the word "theirs" can be found in the Polish language.  Nevertheless, it is there.

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,539
It never claimed to be called a literary norm,

88
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,039
it was never in wide use.  And the letter has always been used only

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,599
to convey the speech of the villagers.

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,119
“Apostates are called Hussites, and this is taken from their prophet Hus, and not at all from geese.”

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,539
Although in Polish

92
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,119
this word first appeared in any written text even earlier than in Russian.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:15,099
As far back as the 15th century, one can find not only the word "ichni" and not only "jejski" and "jegojski",

94
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,479
but even "twójski", "mojski", "naski", "waski".

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,459
At the very beginning of the video, we already mentioned that the words “he”, “she”, “it”, “they”,

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,739
that is, third-person pronouns,

97
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,739
do not form possessive pronouns.

98
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,199
But why?

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,559
Initially, this situation was typical for all Slavic languages without exception, and 

100
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,359
even more widely - all Indo-European ones!

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,179
 Slavic, Germanic, Baltic, Romanesque, Indo-Iranian - and so on.

102
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,879
Look, now in Russian we have

103
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,759
personal pronouns of the third person, but

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,139
we don’t have possessive ones;  well, like they don't exist,

105
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,839
but even this state of affairs was far from always.

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,419
Once upon a time, we didn’t even have third-person personal pronouns!

107
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,579
All these words come from short forms of the word "onyi".

108
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,959
Let's now turn our eyes to other ancient languages.

109
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,199
Latin language.

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,699
Here are their personal and possessive pronouns:

111
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,579
ego - meus

112
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,839
tu - tUUs (* clause here *)

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,999
nos - noster

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,679
vos -

115
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,079
vester There are simply no personal pronouns and, accordingly, possessive third persons

116
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,299
.  Instead, the

117
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,739
words "hic", "ille" and others are used, which mean "that", "this".

118
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,579
Sanskrit.

119
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,499
aham - madīyaḥ

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,239
tvam - tvadīyaḥ

121
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,279
vayam - asmadīyaḥ

122
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,939
yūyam -

123
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,159
yuṣmadīyaḥ There are simply no personal pronouns and, accordingly, possessive third persons.

124
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,259
Instead of personal words, the words "saḥ", "eṣaḥ"

125
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,179
and others are used, which mean "that", "this".

126
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,059
Now let's look at modern languages!

127
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,899
French is a descendant of Latin, and it already has third-person personal pronouns:

128
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,859
il - he, elle - she.

129
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,219
But they, in turn, come from demonstrative Latin "ille", "illa"

130
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,339
"this", "this".

131
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,859
"their" in French is "leur".

132
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,899
This word directly comes from the Latin "illorum" -

133
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,259
"them" or "these."

134
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,719
This, as in Russian, was the genitive

135
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,798
plural form.

136
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,158
However, the modern French also

137
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,079
literally says "theirs", that is, he changes this word like adjectives.

138
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,038
For example,

139
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,939
"leurs amis" - their (s) friends

140
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,139
"leurs mots" - their (s) words

141
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,919
If there is a hole in the language system, a person wants to unconsciously fill it with something,

142
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,679
but if there are possessive

143
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,999
first and second person pronouns, then  why

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,439
not build the forms of the third one on the basis of similar models?

145
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,999
Finally, let's take a curious example from the Baltic languages.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,999
That's how Lenin said: "We'll go the other way!"

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,999
- just like the Baltic languages would say. 

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,999
They did not come up with the words “theirs”, “hers”, “evony”,

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,999
they simply removed the words “mine”, “your”, “ours”, “your”.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,999
True, the words “mine” and “your” still remain in the Latvian language.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,999
For example, “mana sieva” is my wife,

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,999
“tavs brālis” is your brother.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,999
But the words "our", "your" are no longer there.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,999
For example,

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,999
"mūsu valdība" is our government.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,999
Literally, it is "us government".

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,999
Or "jusu nauda" - your money.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,999
Literally "you money".

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,499
And the Lithuanian language has not even left the words “mine”, “your”.

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,999
For example,

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,999
“mano nuotraukos” are my photos,

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,499
“mano gynyba” is my defense,

163
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,999
“tavo problemos” are your problems.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,999
As we can see, the Baltic languages

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,999
d out their changes in the same way according to the so-called analogy.  But 

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,999
another thing is that this analogy went in a completely different direction

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,999
than in most other European languages.
