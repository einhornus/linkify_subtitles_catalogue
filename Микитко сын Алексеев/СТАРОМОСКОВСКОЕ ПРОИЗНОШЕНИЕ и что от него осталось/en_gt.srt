1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,819
last year I conducted one linguistic experiment,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,879
I purposely shot episodes in the old Moscow pronunciation for several months,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,019
unfortunately the mass audience then did not understand why I pronounce some words differently,

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,769
so let this video serve as a radical clarification of all questions in the comments on this subject

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:28,028
and  By the way, this video itself will also be in the old Moscow pronunciation so that all the nuances are not only in theory

6
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:51,599
but also perceived by ear.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,639
First, let's analyze, let's say, the

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,079
classic old Moscow pronunciation,

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,139
its features could often be heard even in late Soviet times from TV, radio announcers, and actors

10
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,799
among actors, especially among those who played in the theater,

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,679
as well as in modern literary pronunciation, it was spoken not only by Muscovites by birth,

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,179
it was easily adopted by people from other cities, but to varying degrees

13
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,129
assimilating different features,

14
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,559
so old Moscow features could be heard in the speech of various prominent people of those years

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:02:58,059
and on  i.e. written or audio evidence, for example  this is

16
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,848
when the spelling was not yet well-established, the old Moscow features were often reflected in the letter,

17
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,768
so the magazine that Karamzin published in the original spelling was called the

18
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,839
Moscow magazine, the

19
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,919
old Moscow pronunciation, at least implied when reading a particular work

20
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,919
, can often be

21
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:47,408
determined from poetic texts, for example, Pushkin Evgeny Onegin

22
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:52,539
thus, in terms of sound, these forms fully correspond to the feminine forms of the

23
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,919
genitive case

24
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,999
high no high strict no strict, and so on, you

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,239
don’t need to pronounce them with some special emphasis and emphasis on the ending,

26
00:04:01,240 --> 00:05:44,619
otherwise it turns out to be a caricature,

27
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,439
however, not all combinations of h became shn

28
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,399
no clear rule  but shn was avoided where it could cause unwanted associations,

29
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,379
let’s say they didn’t say oriental instead of oriental or superfluous instead of personal,

30
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,859
also shn apparently always sounded colloquial in new borrowed words,

31
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,939
so it was also avoided, say, they didn’t say

32
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,359
romantic typical logical instead of romance  typical typical logical

33
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:34,559
here are examples from the author’s spelling of the classics,

34
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,999
but even in Moscow on Pokrovka, a stone’s throw from the economic faculty of the tower, there is such a restaurant, I

35
00:06:42,000 --> 00:08:05,539
suggest that all zealots of the old Moscow speech gather here for joint imposing leisure,

36
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,179
so if we see a combination of consonant + consonant in modern language  + softening vowel

37
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,899
and we have this and e yo yu i then we will only have the last consonant

38
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,599
in the old Moscow pronunciation soft all the consonants of the syllable become soft

39
00:08:21,600 --> 00:15:25,939
softness can be thrown not only through one consonant but also through two and three of

40
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,659
course this is not all all the features  old Moscow pronunciation,

41
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:42,179
only the most important ones

42
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,399
, just in case, I’ll say

43
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,079
if you hear one or two old Moscow features in a speech, this still doesn’t mean anything a

44
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,579
person may have nothing to do with Moscow,

45
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,959
and he certainly cannot be suspected of having learned such a pronunciation

46
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,139
the fact is that each dialect contains not only some unique features,

47
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:06,479
but also those that are common  he has some other dialects, and in general with the whole language,

48
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,239
so the ending oh of adjectives was characteristic of all Old Russian northeastern dialects,

49
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,399
so it still remains under stress with us

50
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,269
pronunciation they hear Moscow has in common with southern Russian dialects

51
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:24,359
initial  and was still in Proto-Slavic and its traces can still be found in various modern Slavic languages. The

52
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:39,659
oppositional softness of consonants is generally still a Proto-Balto-Slavic invention.

53
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,919
it seems to them,

54
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,219
oh, what a wonderful pronunciation it was, what a pity that she disappeared,

55
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,329
no, friends,

56
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,519
she didn’t disappear anywhere,

57
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:00,259
and this, in principle, could only happen if at some point the entire population of the city left it or died,

58
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,119
as we say, it was several times in  history with Veliky Novgorod for the

59
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,719
last time during the Great Patriotic War, all of its post-war population is  travelers from other cities or from the region,

60
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,199
all of its post-war population are visitors from other cities or from the region,

61
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:18,239
but fortunately this has never happened in Moscow and therefore we are still talking with a large number of features of old Moscow origin,

62
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,368
now I will no longer focus on theoretical knowledge  but on my language experience as a fourth-generation native Muscovite,

63
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:33,539
but just in case, I decided to make my fabrications a little more objective and for this I conducted a survey for my VKontakte group

64
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,359
by the time the video was recorded, I received 62 questionnaires

65
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,779
in the survey, I asked only native Muscovites to participate, of

66
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,959
course there were  some additional questions, but the main one was such a task,

67
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,419
it was necessary to distribute 30 examples into three groups, the

68
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,689
first is that I say it myself the

69
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,479
second I heard it but I don’t say it myself

70
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,919
and the third I didn’t hear it and I don’t say it

71
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,789
myself  does not count, but it is in live speech in life,

72
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:19,219
yes, I already agree with the prof in advance  With the help of linguists, this method of questioning is the worst way to collect linguistic material.

73
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,499
More about the results of this survey, I told in a post in my group

74
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:31,939
with the results themselves, you can also find the link in the description,

75
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,719
this feature has already disappeared from speech,

76
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,439
but it can still be found  where it is used for artistic purposes,

77
00:18:39,440 --> 00:19:06,599
say in a play or in a song in some separate layer,

78
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,459
this feature is quite strongly associated with theatricality, in my opinion

79
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:41,979
it can still be often found among old actors and TV presenters,

80
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,159
but it has completely disappeared from live speech  with the exception of the combination of ls

81
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:55,459
, many people still say they remained afraid, they confessed, they married

82
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,279
most of the words we already speak with ch, new words are always with ch,

83
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,419
but still there are still a few words by which you can almost accurately determine a non-resident

84
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,319
Muscovite will never say of course on purpose a

85
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,539
birdhouse  scrambled eggs,

86
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,999
however, there are many words where Muscovites now say this way and that

87
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,339
mustard mud  and mustard maid or housemaid

88
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,559
rag or rag serious or serious decent or orderly

89
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,039
now I will show

90
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,759
linguistic subjectivism and at the same time shtetlness

91
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,759
there is such a word as boring

92
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,339
Muscovites most often pronounce it well, of course, they can say boring, but this is less often,

93
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,639
again, we look at the results of the survey

94
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,729
like this  here, not far from the place where he lived in childhood, of

95
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,339
course, a local always has to say a

96
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,219
boring garden,

97
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,519
and a visitor, a person from outside can say

98
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,939
boring whether the locals participated in my survey, I don’t know, but the results are very strangely

99
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,369
curious, also the word is enough

100
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,399
I myself in  as a child, I spoke this way and that, and therefore I clearly remembered only a few people

101
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,779
who spoke the same way as I did,

102
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:19,379
which is surprising out of 62 respondents, 10 said that they can also say enough,

103
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,029
in my opinion this is a little

104
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,319
strange, however, this does not bother me, I continue my story

105
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,659
like this  there was somehow such a case, I met a girl,

106
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:36,659
she is not from Moscow at all, she  here she is only studying and in general her speech was no different from the speech of all other Muscovites, with the

107
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,379
exception of one thing, she constantly spoke

108
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,399
enough

109
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,069
when I noticed this speech nuance in her I was so delighted that I made a rule

110
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,169
one old Moscow feature in her speech from me kiss my cheek

111
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,919
well  and to her credit, after that, she didn’t have such a pronunciation more or less often,

112
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,639
so I became thoughtful and who in my environment still speaks enough and I remembered only

113
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,679
4 people, this is my former boss, candidate of philological sciences,

114
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:19,199
also 2 more elderly philologists who we have  often make presentations at conferences, I take them off in the service, and also suddenly

115
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,599
Arseniy Klinchev from the channel n Cyclops,

116
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,839
although he comes from Khimki,

117
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,239
also sh n are still kept in patronymics,

118
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,999
I think that every man once thought about how you can name children

119
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,799
and how  this or that name will be combined with a patronymic,

120
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,379
but since I myself am Nikita, I am well aware that the female form is still nikitishna

121
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,709
and not nikitichna,

122
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:54,719
but not everyone  I was aware of this so I had a girlfriend already different her name is Maria Nikitishna

123
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,159
so it was very annoying when someone pronounced her middle name with h n once she even staged a tirade about this

124
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,169
so so so so for some Muscovites so far  and the forms

125
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,209
nikitichna kuzminichna

126
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:20,539
ilyinichna and others are not acceptable, keep this in mind because people usually have strong emotions for the unusual pronunciation of their own name,

127
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:42,779
everything depends somehow on specific words, there are also words where no one will ever say never firmly,

128
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,699
although most people in  In my survey, they said that they would say snow,

129
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,459
and also quite a lot of people admit

130
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,659
that if

131
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,639
something about the soft sound r

132
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,759
is lost a little differently in the speech of Muscovites,

133
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,779
so researcher Antonova

134
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:04,629
analyzed about four hours of recordings from television in 2008 and in 17 percent of cases the announcers still

135
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:12,999
soft p was preserved in the following words,

136
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,529
well, in my speech, there was definitely always borscht borscht, and

137
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:33,629
perhaps also these words about others I don’t know labor  but it

138
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:39,329
’s also very different to say here, depending on the word,

139
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:50,489
it turns out that most people don’t say a comb and apparently they say a comb,

140
00:24:50,490 --> 00:25:12,389
but what exactly a Muscovite will never say is a man,

141
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:40,319
most Muscovites from the survey, by the way, also pronounce these soft ones,

142
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,689
we still speak easily, light though  otherwise they would have to speak easily

143
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,799
lekko, lekky

144
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:54,899
seems these two words are the only thing that we have left from that old phonetics,

145
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,749
such forms seem to be quite rural, but no one speaks like that for sure, but

146
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,949
no,

147
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:08,999
let's turn to the same study of Antonova, she showed  that up to 15 percent of young people have such variants in speech

148
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,529
in the older age group, this percentage reaches 50

149
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,269
what I will now say applies to modern speech and old

150
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:28,489
Muscovites speak the Moscow dialect, which belongs to the group of Central Russian dialects,

151
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:36,889
while Muscovites speak a literary language  and even despite the fact that the very old Moscow pronunciation has long become

152
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,078
an extraordinary curiosity

153
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,259
about  but it is still considered one of the literary standards of the

154
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:50,119
contradiction here, no, you don’t have to think that the dialects are spoken by the provinces or in general in the village,

155
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,879
and the literary language is only the language of literature

156
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,259
in their own dialect, the dialect is spoken, everything

157
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:03,199
is just a territorial variety of speech, it can coincide  with the literary, that is, the normalized

158
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,779
standardized language, it may not

159
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,159
coincide in our case, because the Russian literary norm is

160
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,679
based on the dialects of Moscow and St. Petersburg,

161
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,059
and the pronunciation of both Muscovites of the past and modern

162
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,999
ones was not and is not the same, and it has always been so,

163
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,759
and therefore there is nothing surprising, let's put  in the fact that the

164
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,558
Moscow pastor softened the consonant, said the stars sleep, spoke lightly, but at the same time did not pronounce firmly, I’m afraid I

165
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:38,479
’ll return, or that Trotsky, for whom the old Moscow pronunciation was not natural, but who wanted to master it, he became skilled in it

166
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:53,389
, but not enough, and therefore, within the framework of one and  the same speech, he speaks differently about  wore out the same endings of adjectives

167
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,538
one hundred and fifty years ago, the gap between the

168
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:02,899
literary pronunciation and the everyday Moscow pronunciation was greater and more noticeable than even now

169
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,879
there is also an opinion that the old Moscow pronunciation is largely a sociolect

170
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,179
today we are convinced that

171
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:17,688
it was more characteristic not so much of Muscovites  as such, but generally educated people of that time, not necessarily from Moscow,

172
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:23,779
in Moscow itself on the street, the so-called Moscow urban vernacular was more often heard

173
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:32,179
about him, you can also read about him in one work, the link in the description,

174
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:37,109
in particular, such a mannered Moscow pronunciation was characteristic of him

175
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,039
from a cartoon of teasers

176
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,019
with a stretching of the first pre-stressed syllable when yelling, I always thought that this was some kind of stupid stereotype,

177
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,419
but it just

178
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,899
turned out differently, it turned out completely, and it turned out that they really once spoke in Moscow,

179
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,339
but not educated people, but those whose ancestors were from the middle class

180
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,699
I have been looking for people who say so for a very long time and yet 1 n  Ashel

181
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,219
Platoshtin is not from Moscow, from the Moscow region,

182
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:11,489
and perhaps, as he says, they used to speak all over Moscow, but I’ll say right away that I never heard people with such a

183
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:42,439
pronunciation in my environment at all

184
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,399
two years ago I decided to shoot a program in the style of the sixties language front

185
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,719
and did it  under the impression of both the cinema of the

186
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,128
Soviet and the French new wave, and in both countries at that time such a literary standard was still held in high esteem,

187
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:02,188
which was alien to most carriers, including in the pronunciation of

188
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:05,399
Russian examples, you have already heard now you will hear

189
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,659
French, I think that a huge  the difference between the pronunciation of the

190
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,398
announcer who is trained in all the norms and the natural French speech of the singer who is being interviewed

191
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:21,079
for this, even knowing French is not necessary, you will definitely notice in the announcer's speech these prim intonations of

192
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:57,459
longitude this very clear pronunciation of all sounds

193
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,558
so I turned to this tradition of ours  and the old Moscow pronunciation, according to my idea,

194
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:10,479
should have been created  some charm of those years and I studied the topic in detail, I myself learned how to speak quite

195
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:29,119
naturally and also taught this reprimand to my Sasha and then another encyclop,

196
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,039
and at some point, from about June to October

197
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,079
2018, I generally released all the videos on my  channel on the old Moscow pronunciation,

198
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,198
then I decided to abandon it because the

199
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,178
people do not understand,

200
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:46,719
yes, of course, someone appreciated the reference,

201
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,439
many, I think, noticed some oddities in the pronunciation, but

202
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,418
tactfully kept silent, but a separate group of citizens did not understand anything and started to babble,

203
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:03,399
I even made a fix under the video  with explanations, but as you understand

204
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,779
, firstly, most commentators are lazy; secondly, they write their

205
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:14,198
messages in a state of some affect, and most of the comments, unfortunately or fortunately,

206
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:20,678
indicate that the commentators are still in the affect one way or another, that is, they are in a very strong emotional  shocked,

207
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:27,629
therefore they cannot read either other comments or the fix itself, and everyone asks one and  the same questions for which at some point you want to

208
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,938
start banning and what is your ending

209
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:37,249
and what is your dialect and what is the pronunciation of the costs of the profession and so on,

210
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:43,459
but I will not say that this experiment was some kind of mistake in my life and  that's what I got out of it for myself

211
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:51,859
firstly, I created a lot of content in the old Moscow pronunciation in modern conditions with our contemporaries with good recording quality

212
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:58,489
at a modern pace of speech, that is, I showed how our literary language would sound if its history in Soviet times  went differently,

213
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:04,278
well, this content was interesting not only for pronunciation, but it was valuable in itself

214
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,428
pronunciation is just a curious feature, so to speak

215
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:11,479
, secondly, I felt myself in the shoes of a person who does not know the

216
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,439
necessary pronunciation and intends to master it, that is, I was like such a collective farmer who  in Soviet times, during the years of urbanization, he

217
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,199
comes to the city and intends to master there the reprimand that he hears from the townspeople, the

218
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,398
only nuance about the comments of the EU  if the collective farmer heard rather reproach for his

219
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,619
native natural accent, then I hear reproach for the accent learned

220
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,058
it is noteworthy that the

221
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:39,619
mechanism for mastering an idiom that differs only in some sneeze from his own

222
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:45,259
is such that if you talk a lot and practice a lot, then all these old forms of

223
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,199
Mayakovsky are the first light  brown ones fly away by themselves,

224
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,959
but alas, your native accent is firmware for life,

225
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,139
so not everything, of course, but a lot of your learned pronunciation goes away

226
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,859
just when you are tired, when you worry and, accordingly, control yourself less

227
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,019
in the third, and I have not fully returned to how I spoke for two years  ago,

228
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,479
I left some separate words in the old Moscow sound in my speech,

229
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,359
and moreover, now I say this not only on video, but in general, always in life, too, it’s

230
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,959
just basically such very rare, barely noticeable features

231
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,459
that do not strike an unpleasant ear like a word in  - first, let's say

232
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,859
in general, watch any of my broadcasts, that's how I say there, I always say that

233
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,319
old Moscow  I still gave some kind of charm to my speech with my pronunciation, of

234
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,299
course, someone will say nonsense, that's all I partly agree,

235
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:43,099
but this is normal because the language of each of us and our dialect changes with age

236
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,198
and far from always this happens in some natural way,

237
00:34:47,199 --> 00:35:00,419
it can be  a conscious move, well, suppose the study of literary norms at school, research, the

238
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,319
old Moscow pronunciation was never completely equal to the pronunciation of Muscovites,

239
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,729
it was characteristic of various educated people in the past, mainly from Moscow, but not only

240
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:19,039
the later the bearer of the old Moscow accent lived, the more likely this pronunciation was put

241
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,979
in  In Soviet times, the Moscow standard sounded mainly from TV and radio announcers, from theater

242
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,619
actors, some elderly representatives of these professions can still hear

243
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:36,219
it, but the speech of Moscow streets differed in many respects from the standard we analyzed by

244
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,339
linguists, it is called Moscow urban vernacular

245
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,879
completely Staromoskovsk  its pronunciation as such did not disappear,

246
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,419
it simply dissolved in modern everyday life

247
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,459
and in some words the old Moscow features seem ordinary to us,

248
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,799
but somewhere they sound already clearly outdated,

249
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,059
and since the whole country has long been trying to speak like the capital,

250
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:03,779
then the features of the old Moscow pronunciation  now widespread

251
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,199
everywhere, well, but on that, goodbye for now I

252
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
’ll throw an end
