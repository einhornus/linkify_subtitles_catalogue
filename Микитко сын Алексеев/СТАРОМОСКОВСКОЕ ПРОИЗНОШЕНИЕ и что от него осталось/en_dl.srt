1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,819
I did a linguistic experiment last year

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,879
I purposely filmed the newscasts for several months using Old Moscow pronunciation.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,019
unfortunately the public didn't understand why I pronounced some words differently

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,769
so let this video serve as a radical clarification of all the questions in the comments on this subject

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:28,028
and by the way this video will also be on the old Moscow pronunciation so that all the nuances are not only in theory

6
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:51,599
but also perceived by ear

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,639
First let's break it down like this

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,079
the classic old Moscow accent

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,139
Its traits could be often heard in the late Soviet period among speakers of TV and radio, among actors.

10
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,799
actors, especially those who played in the theater.

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,679
like the modern literary accent, it was not only spoken by Muscovites by birth

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,179
it was easily adopted by the non-Moscovites, but in varying degrees

13
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,129
assimilating different traits

14
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,559
so the old-Moscow peculiarities could be heard in the speech of various prominent people of those years

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:02:58,059
and there's written or audio evidence of that, like this.

16
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,848
when orthography was not yet settled, Old Moscow features were often reflected in the writing

17
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,768
so the magazine published by Karamzin in the original spelling was called

18
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,839
Moscow magazine

19
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,919
Old Moscow pronunciation, at least implied in the reading of a particular work

20
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,919
can often be determined

21
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:47,408
from poetic texts such as Pushkin's Eugene Onegin

22
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:52,539
thus by their sounding these forms completely correspond to the feminine forms

23
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,919
genitive

24
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,999
high no high austere no austere and so on.

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,239
there is no need to pronounce them with some special emphasis or stress on the ending

26
00:04:01,240 --> 00:05:44,619
otherwise it's a caricature.

27
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,439
not all combinations of chn become shn

28
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,399
there is no strict rule, but shn was avoided where it could cause unwanted associations

29
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,379
for example we didn't say oriental instead of oriental or redundant instead of personal

30
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,859
and also schn seems to have always sounded simply in new borrowed words

31
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,939
so it was also avoided, let's say we didn't say

32
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,359
romantic typical logical instead of romantic typical logical

33
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:34,559
Here are examples from the author's spelling of the classics

34
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,999
But there's also this restaurant in Moscow on Pokrovka, a stone's throw from the tower's economics department.

35
00:06:42,000 --> 00:08:05,539
I invite all devotees of old Moscow speech to gather here for some imposing leisure

36
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,179
So, if in modern language we see a combination of consonant + consonant + softening vowel.

37
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,899
and in our language it's eeu ya, only the last consonant will be soft.

38
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,599
In Old Moscow pronunciation all consonants in a syllable become soft.

39
00:08:21,600 --> 00:15:25,939
Softness can go not only through one consonant, but through two or three.

40
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,659
Of course, these are not all the features of Old Moscow pronunciation.

41
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:42,179
just the most important ones.

42
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,399
just in case

43
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,079
If you hear one or two Old Moscow traits in a speech, it does not mean anything at all.

44
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,579
the person may have nothing to do with Moscow,

45
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,959
and he certainly can't be suspected of having learned his pronunciation.

46
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,139
the fact is that each dialect contains not only some unique traits

47
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:06,479
but also those that it has in common with some other dialects and with the whole language.

48
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,239
so the ending oy of adjectives was characteristic of all Old Russian northeastern accents

49
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,399
that's why we still have it under stress

50
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,269
the pronunciation is common between Moscow and southern Russian accents

51
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:24,359
initial and was still in Proto-Slavonic and its traces can still be found in the various modern Slavonic languages.

52
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,699
the oppositional softness of consonants is still a pre-Blavonic invention.

53
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:39,659
It's survived equally in Lithuanian, Polish, Russian and other languages.

54
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,919
often when people listen to an old speech, not necessarily Russian, they think.

55
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,219
what a wonderful pronunciation it was. What a pity it's gone.

56
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,329
No, friends.

57
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,519
it hasn't disappeared.

58
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:00,259
and that could only happen if at some point the entire population of the city left or died.

59
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,119
as was the case several times in the history of Veliky Novgorod

60
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,719
the last time during the Second World War, all its population after the war were newcomers from other cities or from the region

61
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,199
all of its postwar population are migrants from other cities or from the region.

62
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:18,239
but luckily Moscow has never had that, and that's why we still speak with a lot of old-Moscow traits

63
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,368
now I will be guided not by theoretical knowledge but by my own linguistic experience as a fourth-generation Muscovite

64
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:33,539
But just in case, I decided to make my conclusions a bit more objective, and for this I conducted a survey in my facebook group

65
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,359
By the time the video was recorded, I had received 62 questionnaires

66
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,779
I asked only native Muscovites to participate in the survey

67
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,959
Of course, there were some additional questions, but the main task was this

68
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,419
I had to distribute 30 examples into three groups.

69
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,689
The first is what I said myself.

70
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,479
The second is that I've heard it, but I don't say it myself.

71
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,119
and the third is I haven't heard it, but I don't say it myself.

72
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,919
and by "hear" you mean

73
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,789
not in general, let's say the Internet, an old movie doesn't count, but it's in live speech in life

74
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:19,219
Yes, I already agree in advance with professional linguists this way of survey is the worst way to collect linguistic material

75
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,499
I have described the results of this survey in more detail in my group post.

76
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:31,939
the results themselves you can also follow the link in the description

77
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,719
this trait is gone from the speech.

78
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,439
but it can still be found where it's used for artistic purposes.

79
00:18:39,440 --> 00:19:06,599
say in a play or in a song in a particular layer.

80
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,459
it's quite firmly associated with theatricality, in my opinion.

81
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:41,979
it's still often found in old actors and TV hosts.

82
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,159
but it's disappeared from the vernacular altogether, except for the combination of ls

83
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:55,459
Many people still say stayed, feared, confessed, married.

84
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,279
most of the words we say with a chn, new words always with a chn.

85
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,419
but there are still a few words you can almost definitely use to identify a non-Russian.

86
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,319
a Muscovite will never say of course on purpose

87
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,539
birdhouse egg

88
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,999
however, there are many words where Muscovites now say it both ways

89
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,339
mustard or mustardy chambermaid or chambermaid

90
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,559
rag or raggy or raggy no-nonsense or no-nonsense decent or decent

91
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,039
Now I'm going to be

92
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,759
linguistic subjectivism and also localism

93
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,759
there is such a word as boring

94
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,339
Muscovites pronounce it that way most often, of course they can also say boring, but this is rare

95
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,639
Again, look at the results of the survey

96
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,729
So, not far from where I lived as a child there are

97
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,339
Of course a local always has to say

98
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,219
a boring garden.

99
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,519
but a visitor, a person from the outside can say not boring

100
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,939
I don't know if the locals took part in my survey but the results are very strange

101
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,369
curious is also the word enough

102
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,399
I myself as a child talked both ways and so I distinctly remembered only a few people

103
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,779
who spoke as I did

104
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:19,379
surprisingly out of 62 respondents 10 said they could say enough too

105
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,029
I think that's a little bit

106
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,319
it's a little bit strange nevertheless it doesn't stop me from going on with my story

107
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,659
So there was this one time I was dating a girl.

108
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:36,659
she is not from moscow she just studied here and in general her speech was no different from that of all other Muscovites except for

109
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,379
except for one thing she was always talking

110
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,399
quite

111
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,069
when I noticed that she spoke so well, I was so delighted that I made a rule

112
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,169
one old Moscow trait in her speech with me kiss my cheek

113
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,919
Well, to her credit, she didn't get that pronunciation more or less often after that.

114
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,639
I wondered who else in my circle speaks enough and I remembered only

115
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,679
Four people are my former boss, a PhD candidate in philology.

116
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:19,199
and 2 other elderly philologists who often give talks at conferences, I take them off at work and also all of a sudden

117
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,599
Arseniy Klinchev from the N Cyclops Channel

118
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,839
even though he's from Khimki.

119
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,239
also, the surnames are still kept in the patronymics

120
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,999
I think that every man has ever wondered what to name his children

121
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,799
and how this or that name will go with the patronymic

122
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,099
but since I myself am Nikita, I am well aware that the feminine form is still

123
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,379
Nikitishna

124
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,709
and not nikitichna

125
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:54,719
but not everyone is aware of it so I had a girlfriend who is called Maria Nikitishna

126
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,159
and it was very annoying when someone pronounced her patronymic with a "n" once she even went on a tirade about it

127
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,169
So what so what so for some Muscovites are still unacceptable forms

128
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,209
Nikitichna Kuzminichna

129
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:16,589
Ilyinichna and others keep this in mind because the unfamiliar pronunciation of one's own name usually causes people

130
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,539
strongest emotions

131
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:42,779
It all depends somehow on the specific words. There are words where no one will ever say never.

132
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,699
although most people in my survey said they would say snow.

133
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,459
and also quite a lot of people admit

134
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,659
if

135
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,639
something about the soft r sound.

136
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,759
it's lost a little bit differently in the speech of Muscovites

137
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,779
so the researcher Antonova this is 2008

138
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:04,629
analyzed about four hours of tv recordings and in 17 percent of the cases the speakers still had

139
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:12,999
the soft "r" in the following words.

140
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,529
well in my speech it was always borscht borscht and

141
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:33,629
maybe also these words, I don't know about the others, it's hard to say.

142
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:39,329
It's very different here, too, depending on the word.

143
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:50,489
it turns out most people don't say comb and apparently they say comb

144
00:24:50,490 --> 00:25:12,389
but what exactly a Muscovite will never say is man

145
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:40,319
Most of the Muscovites in the survey also pronounce these soft g's

146
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,689
we still say easy, easy even though we should say easy otherwise.

147
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,799
easy, easy.

148
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:54,899
these two words seem to be the only thing we have left of the old phonetics.

149
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,749
These forms seem very rustic, but we don't speak that way for sure

150
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,949
No, we don't.

151
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:08,999
let's go back to the Antonova research, she showed that up to 15 percent of young people have such variants in their speech

152
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,529
In the older age group the percentage goes up to 50

153
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,269
what I'm about to say applies to both modern and old speech

154
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:28,489
Muscovites speak Muscovite dialect, which belongs to the Middle Russian dialect group

155
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:36,889
moreover Muscovites speak in a literary language and even though the pronunciation of the Old Moscow itself has long since become

156
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,078
an extraordinary curiosity

157
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,259
it is still considered one of the literary standards

158
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:50,119
There is no contradiction here. Don't think that dialects are necessarily the language spoken in the provinces or in the countryside.

159
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,879
and a literary language is only the language of literature

160
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,259
Everyone speaks their dialect.

161
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:03,199
it is simply a territorial variety of speech, it may coincide with a literary, i.e. standardized

162
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,779
standardized language may not.

163
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,159
In our case, it coincides because the Russian literary norm

164
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,679
is based on the dialects of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

165
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,059
and the pronunciation itself, both of Muscovites of the past and of contemporary Muscovites

166
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,999
was not and is not unified, and has always been so

167
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,759
and so it's not surprising to think that

168
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,558
Pasternak the pastor from Moscow softened a consonant, he said the stars sleep, he said easy, but at the same time he didn't pronounce it firmly I'm afraid

169
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:38,479
or that Trotsky, for whom the Old Moscow pronunciation was not natural, but who wanted to master it, mastered it

170
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:53,389
he was good at it, but not good enough, and that's why he pronounced the same adjective endings differently within one and the same speech

171
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,538
a hundred and fifty years ago the gap between

172
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:02,899
the literary pronunciation and the common Moscow pronunciation was greater than even now

173
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,879
There is also an opinion that Old Moscow pronunciation is largely sociolect.

174
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,179
Today we're convinced that

175
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:17,688
it was more typical not so much for Muscovites as such but for educated people of that time not necessarily from Moscow

176
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:21,559
in moscow itself, it was more common to hear the so-called

177
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,779
Moscow urban vernacular.

178
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:32,179
you can also read about it in one paper, the link is in the description.

179
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,999
in particular, it was characterized by this mannerly

180
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,109
Moscow

181
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,039
pronunciation from the caricature of teasers

182
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,019
with the stretching of the first pre-vowel syllable in the acan, I always thought it was a stupid stereotype.

183
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,419
but that's not how it turned out.

184
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,899
It turned out that this was indeed how people in Moscow used to speak

185
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,339
but not by educated people but by those whose ancestors were from bourgeoisie

186
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,699
It took me a long time to find people who spoke that way and yet I found one

187
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,219
Platoshtin didn't come from Moscow, but from the suburbs

188
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:11,489
And it is possible that the way he speaks, and used to speak all over Moscow, but I must say right away that I do not have people with this pronunciation in my

189
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:42,439
I've never heard people with such a pronunciation in my neighborhood.

190
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,399
Two years ago I had the idea of making a program in the style of the sixties, linguofront

191
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,719
and it was inspired by both the cinema

192
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,128
Soviet and French new wave and in both countries at the time it was still in vogue

193
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:02,188
such a literary standard that was alien to most speakers, including in pronunciation

194
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:05,399
The Russian examples you've already heard, now you're going to hear

195
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,659
French I think there will be a huge difference between the pronunciation of the announcer

196
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,398
of the announcer who is trained in all the norms and the natural French speech of the singer who is being interviewed.

197
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:21,079
You don't even have to know French to do that. You'll notice this stiff intonation in the announcer's speech.

198
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:57,459
the longhts, the very distinct pronunciation of all the sounds.

199
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,558
so I turned to this tradition of ours and the old Moscow pronunciation I had in mind

200
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:10,479
was to create a kind of charm of those years and I studied the subject in detail myself and learned to speak it quite

201
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:29,119
at ease and also taught this pronunciation to my Sasha and then to the Encyclopa

202
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,039
and so at some point, from about June to October

203
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,079
2018 I was releasing all the videos on my channel in the old Moscow pronunciation

204
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,198
and then I decided to give it up because

205
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,178
people don't understand.

206
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:46,719
Yeah, some people appreciate the reference.

207
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,439
I think a lot of people noticed some weirdness in the pronunciation but

208
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,418
but a separate group of citizens didn't understand and started barking

209
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:03,399
I even made a tab under the video with explanations, but as you know

210
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,779
First of all, most commentators are lazy. Second of all, they write their

211
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:14,198
messages in a certain state of affect and most of the comments, unfortunately or fortunately

212
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:20,678
says that the commentators are still in a state of affect, i.e. they're in a very strong emotional turmoil.

213
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:27,629
that's why they can't read any of the other comments or the post and everyone asks the same questions for which at some point they want to

214
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,938
I'm going to get banned. What's your ending?

215
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:37,249
what's your dialect, what's your pronunciation, what's your profession, and so on.

216
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:43,459
But I will not say that this experiment was a mistake in my life, and here's what I made of it

217
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:51,859
first of all I created a lot of content in the old Moscow pronunciation in modern conditions with our contemporaries with a good quality of recording

218
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:58,489
at a modern pace of speech, that is, I showed how our literary language would have sounded if its history had gone differently in Soviet times

219
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:04,278
and this content was not only interesting in pronunciation but it was valuable in its own right

220
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,428
Pronunciation is just a curious thing.

221
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:11,479
Secondly, I felt myself in the skin of a person who doesn't know

222
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,439
the necessary pronunciation and intend to learn it, that is, I was like a collective farmer who in Soviet times in the years of urbanization

223
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,199
comes to town and intends to learn the accent that he hears from the townspeople.

224
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,398
the only nuance about the comments if the collective farmer heard rather reprimand for his

225
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,619
native accent is natural, then I hear censure for a learned accent

226
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,058
it's remarkable that

227
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:39,619
the mechanism of learning an idiom that is only a sneeze different from one's own

228
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:45,259
so yes, if you talk a lot, exercise a lot, then all these old forms

229
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,199
♪ Mayakovsky's first light-brown fly away ♪

230
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,959
but alas your native accent is stitched for life

231
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,139
so not everything, of course, but a lot of your learned pronunciation goes away

232
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,859
It's just when you're tired when you're nervous and less in control.

233
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,019
Thirdly, I'm not completely back to the way I spoke two years ago.

234
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,479
some of the individual words in the old Moscow sound I kept in my speech

235
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,359
and what's more I speak that way now, not only on video but all the time in life too

236
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,959
It's just mostly these very rare, barely noticeable peculiarities

237
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,459
that aren't unpleasant to the ear like the word first, let's say.

238
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,859
well, look at any of my broadcasts, that's how I talk, that's how I talk all the time.

239
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,319
with the old Moscow pronunciation I've given a certain charm to my speech.

240
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,299
Some people will say it's silly, but I'll partly agree.

241
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:43,099
But this is normal because the language of each of us ours and the dialect changes with age

242
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,198
and it doesn't always happen in some natural way

243
00:34:47,199 --> 00:35:00,419
it can also be a deliberate move, for example, the study of literary norms at school, research

244
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,319
Old Moscow pronunciation was never quite equal to the pronunciation of Muscovites.

245
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,729
it was characteristic of various educated people in the past, mainly from Moscow, but not only

246
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:19,039
the later the bearer of the Old Moscow accent lived, the more likely it was that this accent was adopted

247
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,979
in Soviet times the Moscow standard was mostly pronounced by tv and radio presenters and by theatrical actors.

248
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,619
you can still hear it in some elderly representatives of those professions.

249
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:36,219
speech on the streets of Moscow differed in many respects from the standard we analyzed.

250
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,339
linguists call it Moscow urban vernacular.

251
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,879
The Old Moscow pronunciation as such has not disappeared completely.

252
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,419
it has simply dissolved into modern usage.

253
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,459
and in some words the old-Moscow traits seem commonplace to us

254
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,799
and in some words they sound obsolete.

255
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,059
and since the whole country has long been trying to talk like the capital

256
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:03,779
so features of the old Moscow pronunciation are now widespread everywhere.

257
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,199
Well, that's goodbye for now
