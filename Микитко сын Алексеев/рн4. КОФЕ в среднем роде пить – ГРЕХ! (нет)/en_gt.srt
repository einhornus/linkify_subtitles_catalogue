1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,319
"If anyone from Orthodox Christians dares to drink tea, this hour will despair the Lord God himself

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,159
and be anathematized three times.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,519
If anyone from Orthodox Christians dares to drink coffee,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,279
in that person there will be evil coffee and let him be anathematized four times"

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,379
"About tobacco, about tea  , about coffee"

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,379
Old Believer teaching of the 18th century

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:48,779
*music plays*

8
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,979
For the first time the word coffee was used back in 1665 and immediately

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:07,139
neuter "Boiled coffee, known and common by Persians and Turks after dinner, is a fair remedy for arrogance, runny noses and headaches"

10
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,589
But  the only thing is that only

11
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,013
very noble persons, like the king or his entourage, could drink coffee.

12
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:18,059
It was impossible to just come to the store and buy coffee.

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,669
Therefore, until the time of Peter the Great, this word was not found anywhere else, but in the time of Peter

14
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,228
I, the drink and, accordingly, the word itself became widely used.

15
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,629
As you know, at his assemblies, Peter himself ordered everyone to drink coffee

16
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,779
And in 1720 already  Petersburg, the first coffee house called "4 Frigates" was opened.

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,118
During the 18th century, coffee in the neuter gender was found in as much as one third of cases.

18
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,989
Accordingly, the remaining two thirds are coffee in the masculine gender.

19
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,609
Moreover, it should be noted that this has nothing to do with either the situation or  education of the author of the text, neither with his knowledge of foreign languages,

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,609
nor with style or something like that.

21
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,339
An example of

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:10,219
Karamzin.  1793.

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,859
Unknown.  1783.

24
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,859
Pay attention here to both the middle and masculine gender at the same time

25
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:27,179
"If especially weak coffee is brewed for children, then the harm from it consists only in the fact that it weakens the stomach unnecessarily, as any warm and water drink does"

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,159
Examples of the masculine gender

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,459
Radishchev

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:40,208
"Imagine  , - my friend once told me, - that the coffee poured in your cup, and the sugar dissolved in it, deprived a person like you of peace,

29
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:46,919
that they were the cause of labors surpassing his strength, the cause of his tears, groaning, execution and desecration "

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,599
Fonvizin

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,519
"I asked for coffee, which was immediately served to me. I have never seen such vile swill - just emetic."

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,979
In the 19th century, the middle gender began to be used much less frequently.

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,679
Only in 6% of cases

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,679
Turgenev.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,188
“After dinner, coffee was served, liquid reddish, directly German coffee”

36
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,378
An example of the neuter gender

37
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:20,098
“Shakhrudtsy, like Persians in general, drink only black coffee, that is, without cream and, moreover, very rarely”

38
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:27,268
As is often the case when a foreign word enters a language, at first it  exists in a large number of options.

39
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:35,179
Especially if the word was memorized by ear.  So, along with the word coffee, for a long time such words as coffee

40
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:43,019
"Coffee", "coffee", "kohei", "coffee", "coffee", "coffee", "kefa" and even "cafe" were used.

41
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:50,539
Only three of these words were lucky.  The first two: "coffee" and "coffee" found their firm place in the language of the 19th century,

42
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:59,099
and the last - "cafe", in the French manner, "le café" began to denote the actual place where this same coffee is drunk.

43
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:07,859
Moreover, note that this word immediately became a neuter word, although in French it does not exist at all and the article is masculine there - "le".

44
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:15,439
All other forms of the word were already considered vernacular in the 19th century, and although some of them firmly found their place

45
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,228
in the Old Believer environment, well, let's take that very "sly coffee" that, say, such an example:

46
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,239
Nemirovich-Danchenko.  1874

47
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,299
One thousand and ten rubles for the track deigned to donate

48
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,579
- And it's a sin to drink coffee!  - put in a yellowed and dried-up wanderer.

49
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,809
Although in the middle of the 18th century, a quite serious author could write "kov" or "coffee".

50
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,249
Tatishchev.  1742.

51
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:52,519
... every day he covers the table with the attendant and collects it, and after dinner he brews coffee and delivers it.

52
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,859
As we have already noted, the words "Coffee" and "Coffee" have gained unprecedented popularity.

53
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,439
I looked at the statistics on the site ruscorpra.ru for 150 years

54
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,559
from 1750 to 1900, and it turned out that the word "coffee" was

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:16,479
used five times less often than "coffee", but still "coffee" was three times less common than just "coffee"  .

56
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,859
Coffee, sugar, millet, sweets and the like, imported from Persia,

57
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,478
against those imported through European merchants, consider which bargaining is more useful, those goods to facilitate.

58
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,519
An example from Chekhov.

59
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,999
He forgave me generously with tears and advised me to use acorn coffee for catarrh.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,339
But since the nine hundredth years, both words, as well as "coffee" and "coffee", with "E".

61
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,319
Starting to decline in use.

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,799
Their frequency decreases until the

63
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,459
1950s, until it becomes about the same as now.

64
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,649
That is, this word can be found, but it is

65
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,529
recognized as somehow clearly outdated.

66
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:03,879
As for the gender of the word "coffee" in the 20th century, the neuter gender returns again and we again reach the indicators of the

67
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,979
18th century - a third of all uses.

68
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,699
For example, Alexei Tolstoy, Bulgakov, Bunin, and Brodsky had "coffee" in the neuter gender.

69
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,259
The latter has two versions:

70
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,339
"Coffee in a cup was on the desk"

71
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,159
"I was sitting in an empty ship's bar, drinking my coffee, leafing through a novel ..."

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:37,119
Export items - marijuana, non-ferrous metal, mediocre coffee cigars called "Crown"  and trifles of folk craftsmen.

73
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,399
Now let's see if the word "coffee" was ever inclined. The

74
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,198
answer is "yes", but there is only one case form - the instrumental case -

75
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,829
"Coffee"

76
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:56,138
Imagine - even Tsar Nicholas II himself said so

77
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,573
From his diaries:

78
00:06:57,574 --> 00:07:07,439
"She received  gifts in front of Alix's coffee downstairs"

79
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:24,799
Philologists began to pay attention to the word "coffee" in the neuter gender even before the Revolution.

80
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,939
The author of another book - Chernyshev

81
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,468
"Correctness and purity of Russian speech"

82
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:35,979
1911 This word does not mark in any way, but the text itself contains two such very

83
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,699
contradictory passages.  On the one hand, the word "coffee" is

84
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,599
mentioned among the words that are

85
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,719
"usually used in the neuter gender", but then it is said about it that it is used

86
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,698
"mainly in the masculine gender"

87
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,369
So go and figure it out.

88
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,779
This time, the standardizers of the Soviet era did not radically change anything  - they just reprinted old recommendations

89
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,459
Not a single Soviet dictionary gave preference to the middle gender, but it was mentioned everywhere as colloquial.

90
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,639
So the fact that since the 80s they have been regularly saying that they are supposedly

91
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,079
"introducing new norms" is nothing more than newspaper ducks

92
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,939
Last time  this was, I remember, in 2009, when law No. 195 was adopted, with such a

93
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,899
long name.

94
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,978
This law requires us to use one dictionary in which the word coffee is marked as a neuter word

95
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:42,259
"Oh, there was a terrible hype! Once again they started talking that  the era of the beautiful Russian style has come to an end,

96
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,778
education has been destroyed, and our children will not understand Pushkin. It is

97
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:54,639
regrettable not so much that someone writes like this, but so much that someone  then he listens to this rubbish.

98
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,359
However, news of this kind achieves the goal.

99
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,099
They turn a linguistic phenomenon into a clearly sociolinguistic phenomenon.

100
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,039
That is how "coffee is it" became the clearest indicator of

101
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,259
illiteracy in late Soviet times

102
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,819
. Look.  Along with the middle gender of the word "coffee",

103
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:25,159
normative dictionaries also do not recommend, say, such accents as a sign, an apostrophe, you need a sign and an apostrophe, respectively, and a lot of other things,

104
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,059
but if someone says so, then they won't even pay much attention to it  , on the contrary, they are

105
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,499
more likely to be surprised when they find out that dictionaries advise the opposite.

106
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,838
But to say in a decent society,

107
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,059
"I drank delicious coffee" - it's like stepping into the [ __ ] with your foot and then

108
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,299
not washing your shoes - everyone will immediately say:

109
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,959
"Fu, what an illiterate you are!"

110
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,479
These sons of [ __ ] will also correct, they say,

111
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,819
“Remember, my friend, how to do it right!  Otherwise, you will be giving keys all your life!”

112
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,839
*music*

113
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,719
The word "coffee" in the 17th-18th centuries was

114
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,079
borrowed in several forms from several foreign languages at once, but i

115
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,779
 all languages this word was masculine In German: 

116
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,159
Der Kaffe" In French: 

117
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,359
Le café" In Dutch:  

118
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,639
"Koffie"

119
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,019
That is why the pair "coffee" / "coffee" appeared - apparently from the Dutch

120
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:31,679
sound.

121
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,379
of the 19th centuries, as well as the coffee lovers themselves, are still an educated public.

122
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:51,619
They somehow knew foreign languages and all these examples could be in their memory.  coffee is 

123
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,859
masculine because it's a

124
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,609
drink. Of course, this explanation is completely stupid, it only casts a shadow on the wattle fence

125
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,139
and the astute person immediately has a question:

126
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:15,859
"Well, it's good if coffee is a drink and therefore it is masculine,  then why then the middle gender "beer", "brandy" "sake", "cocoa"?

127
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,819
The reason why the language does not want to contain such an exception and, as it were,

128
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,219
prompts us to use the neuter gender is

129
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:34,139
quite banal - an analogy, because if this exception does not have any semantic or grammatical function, then it is quite possible to get rid of it.

130
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,819
Since in the Russian language  words on "E" are words of exclusively neuter gender, then we have two options:

131
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,879
either we keep the gender, but change the ending and then we get the word "coffee"

132
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,999
or we keep the ending, but we have to change the gender

133
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,499
And so we get the inflected delicious  "coffee"

134
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,329
Compare a similar example, when feminine words enter the Russian language, but

135
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,669
ending in a consonant, and there is no such type of declension in Russian.

136
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:10,779
So in the jargon of Soviet hippies there was the word "gerla", well, because she "girl" is like-  you can't decline the

137
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,099
French "madame" became "madama" on Russian soil,

138
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,599
and there is also such a Scandinavian name as "Ingeborg" which became "Ingeborg" on Russian soil. By the

139
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,419
way, he also made Lithuanian  th language where there are also no corresponding types of

140
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:33,129
consonant declension of the feminine word, but we call "Ingeborga" not only Lithuanians, for example, well, the most famous one is probably the actress

141
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,739
Ingeborga Dapkunaite.

142
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:42,969
We also call Ingeborga any Danes who actually have a name  ends in a consonant

143
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,969
At the beginning of the 20th century, the word "blinds" was a neuter singular word.

144
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,319
So Chernyshev writes:

145
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,359
"Open blinds"

146
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,439
However, later it became a plural word in accordance with Russian types of declension.

147
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,719
Therefore, there is absolutely nothing surprising in the fact that you can celebrate the New Year "in Helsinki"

148
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,635
And the Olympics can be held "in Sochi" I can,

149
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:12,159
for example,  dad says, well, I myself often say so too.

150
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,539
A curious example from the Polish language:

151
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,028
In Polish, the ending "e" is also the ending of the plural,

152
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:24,009
so the word "Google" can be perceived exactly as a word in the plural number

153
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,639
"Szukaj w googlach" -  "Search in Google"

154
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,749
Just like masculine coffee in the past, there were many other now only neuter words

155
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,088
"Cocoa", "jabot", "coupe",

156
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,379
"piano", "piano", "auto", "coat" and others

157
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,969
Tolstoy

158
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,259
"This short man was dressed in a white, leather apron that covered his chest and part of his legs,

159
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:58,379
something like a necklace was put on around his neck, and a tall, white frill protruded from behind the necklace, fringing his oblong face, lit from below"

160
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,379
Herzen

161
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:09,039
"It  there was a thin, tall man, much older than the first;  he was almost all the same color, he was wearing a light green coat "

162
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,899
Insightful viewers remember that on our channel there was such a video as" Third Conversation "

163
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,259
And so there was a girl Masha,

164
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,879
who played the role of an

165
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,679
entrant in the film.

166
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,089
She is associated with such a funny  history

167
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:28,389
Many years ago, she found out somewhere that the word "piano" used to be a masculine word,

168
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,409
and so, they say, it must still be said today.

169
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,879
Indeed, in old texts we find such

170
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,499
Leskov

171
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,659
"Do you recognize him or not, our old  piano?"

172
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,687
And then everyone was surprised, they say, how aristocratic the

173
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:46,539
"Black Piano" sounds.

174
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,659
But still, it's somehow strange.

175
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,759
I even found such a unique photo

176
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:02,279
where I'm on the right, Masha, you see, looks out in the distance.  the black piano in question

177
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,919
I, of course, began to notice that she spoke like that

178
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:14,259
and I myself began to speak to her as another old dictionary advises - “Reference place of the Russian word” 1843 by Nikolai Grech

179
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:21,239
He requires to decline words and speak  "play on  piano "

180
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,159
... knowing how to play the piano, he puts them to music worthy of his subject.

181
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:36,099
It must be said that after a while Masha nevertheless gave up the nobility of her subtlety and began to speak as before.

182
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,699
And the last example that many people hear:

183
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,659
When-  then the masculine word was also the word "metro", because it is an abbreviation, as it were, from

184
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,739
"Metropolitan"

185
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,939
There was such a newspaper - "Soviet Metro"

186
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:56,879
And even in the song it was sung:

187
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:10,879
"But the metro flashed with oak railings, it immediately bewitched all riders"

188
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,259
Word "  coffee" has always been neuter.  Moreover, it first entered the language in this form.

189
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,569
There were periods when the neuter gender almost disappeared, but after a while it began to spread again.

190
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,869
And it is the neuter gender that is the future of the language.

191
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,149
If there is no public opinion, the

192
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:36,979
media will not pay special attention to this  constantly speaking at school, then a couple of generations will pass and the masculine gender will perish.

193
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:45,219
However, in the next decade this is hardly possible, and now all the literate people have already managed to teach the masculine gender to everyone.

194
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:55,359
Well, I personally was lucky - I rarely have to make a choice between how to say: "  hot coffee" or "hot coffee"

195
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,599
I personally don't drink coffee or tea,

196
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:06,198
I don't smoke tobacco.  No,

197
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,879
I just don't.  That's all.

198
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,358
Well, brothers, dear sisters

199
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:13,859
Adieu!
