1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,319
"If anyone dares to drink tea from an Orthodox Christian, he shall be anathematized by the Lord God Himself this hour.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,159
And let him be anathematized three times.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,519
If any man dare to drink coffee from an Orthodox Christian, he will be anathematized three times,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,279
That man will be an evil coffee, and he must be anathematized four times.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,379
"About Tobacco, about Tea, about Coffee"

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,379
Old Believer doctrine of the 18th century.

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:48,779
*(music plays)

8
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,979
The word coffee was first used as early as 1665, and immediately in the middle genera

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:07,139
"Boiled coffee, which Persians and Turks know and customary after dinner, is a great cure for insults, runny noses and major ailments."

10
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,589
But the only thing is that when coffee could only be drunk

11
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,013
Very noble people like the tsar or his retainers.

12
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:18,059
You couldn't just walk into a store and buy coffee.

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,669
So before Peter's time, the word was never found anywhere else, but in Peter's time.

14
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,228
both the drink and, consequently, the word itself becomes widely used.

15
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,629
As you know, at his assemblies Peter himself ordered everyone to drink coffee.

16
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,779
And in 1720 the first coffee house called "4 frigates" was opened in St.Petersburg

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,118
During the eighteenth century, coffee in the neuter gender occurs in as many as one-third of

18
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,989
Accordingly the remaining two thirds are coffee in the masculine form.

19
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,609
And it should be noted that this has nothing to do with the situation, the education of the author of the text, his knowledge of foreign languages,

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,609
or his knowledge of foreign languages, or his style, or anything like that.

21
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,339
Example

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:10,219
Karamzin. 1793.

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,859
Unknown. 1783.

24
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,859
Note here both the middle and the masculine gender at the same time

25
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:27,179
"If a particularly weak coffee is brewed for children, the harm of it is only that it laxes the stomach unnecessarily, as any lukewarm and watery drink does."

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,159
Examples of masculine

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,459
Radishchev

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:40,208
"Imagine," my friend once said to me, "that the coffee poured in your cup, and the sugar dissolved in it, deprived you of the peace of a man like you,

29
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:46,919
that they were the cause of his labours, the cause of his tears, lamentations, executions and scoldings."

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,599
Fonvisin

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,519
"I asked for coffee, which they immediately served me. I have never seen such vile filth - just vomit".

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,979
In the nineteenth century the neuter gender is used much less frequently.

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,679
Всего лишь в 6% случаев

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,679
Тургенев.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,188
"После обеда подали кофе, жидкий рыжеватый, прямо немецкий кофе"

36
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,378
Пример среднего рода

37
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:20,098
"Шахрудцы, как и вообще персы пьют только чёрное кофе, то есть без сливок и притом очень редко"

38
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:27,268
Как это часто бывает при вхождении иностранного слова в язык, поначалу оно существует в большом количестве вариантов.

39
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:35,179
Особенно если слово запоминалось со слуха. Так, наряду со словом кофе, долгое время использовались и такие слова как coffee

40
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:43,019
"Кофей", "кофий", "кохей", "коф", "кофь", "коф", "кефа" и даже "кафе".

41
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:50,539
Повезло только трём из этих слов. Первые два: "кофий" и "кофей" нашли свое прочное место в языке XIX века,

42
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:59,099
а последнее - "кафе", на французский манер, "le café" стал обозначать собственно место где этот самый кофей пьют.

43
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:07,859
Причём обратите внимание что это слово сразу стало словом среднего рода, хотя во французском языке его вообще нет и артикль там мужской - "le".

44
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:15,439
Все остальные формы слова уже в XIX веке считались просторечием, и хотя некоторые из них прочно нашли свое место

45
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,228
в старообрядческой среде, ну взять что того самого "кофъ лукавого" что, скажем, такой пример:

46
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,239
Немирович-Данченко. 1874 год.

47
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,299
Одна тысяча десять рублёв на дорожку изволили пожертвовать

48
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,579
— А коф пить грех! — вставила пожелтевшая и высохшая странница

49
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,809
Although in the middle of the 18th century a serious author could still write "kov" or "kof".

50
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,249
Tatishchev. 1742.

51
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:52,519
... daily he with a footman covers the table and collects, and after dinner he makes coffee and distributes it.

52
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,859
As we have already noted, the words "Coffey" and "Coffee" are unprecedentedly widespread.

53
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,439
I looked up the statistics on ruscorpra.ru for 150 years

54
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,559
from 1750 to 1900, and I found that the word "coffee"

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:16,479
was used five times less often than "coffee," but still "coffee" was three times less often than just "coffee."

56
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,859
Coffee, sugar, millet, candy, and the like, imported from Persia,

57
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,478
against the imported ones through European merchants to consider, which trade is more useful, those and goods to facilitate.

58
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,519
Example from Chekhov.

59
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,999
He generously forgave me with tears and advised me to use acorn caffeine for my catarrh.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,339
But since the nineties, both words, as well as "coffe" and "coffee," with an "E."

61
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,319
Begin to decline in usage.

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,799
Their frequency declines until the

63
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,459
1950s, until it becomes about the same as it is now.

64
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,649
That is, the word can be found, but it

65
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,529
is recognized as somehow clearly obsolete.

66
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:03,879
As for the gender of the word "coffee" in the twentieth century, the middle gender returns again and we again come to the indicators of the

67
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,979
of the eighteenth century - one third of all uses.

68
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,699
For example, "coffee" in the Neuter gender was used by Alexey Tolstoy, Bulgakov, Bunin and Brodsky.

69
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,259
In the latter it occurs in two variants:

70
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,339
"Coffee in a cup stood on the desk."

71
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,159
"I was sitting in an empty ship's bar, drinking my coffee, leafing through a novel..."

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:37,119
The items exported were marijuana, base metal, mediocre coffee cigars called Corona, and folk art trivia.

73
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,399
Now let's see if the word "coffee" has ever been declined

74
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,198
The answer is yes, but there is only one case form, the instrumental case -

75
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,829
"Kofem."

76
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:56,138
Imagine - even Tsar Nicholas II himself said so

77
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,573
From his diaries:

78
00:06:57,574 --> 00:07:07,439
"She received the presents before the coffee downstairs at Alix's."

79
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,999
Philologists began to pay attention to the word "coffee" in the middle gender even before the Revolution

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,779
For example, in the book "Experience of a Dictionary of Irregularities in Colloquial Speech," by Dolopchev, 1909

81
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,799
The word "coffee" in the middle gender is mentioned explicitly as incorrect

82
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,939
The author of the other book is Chernyshev.

83
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,199
"Correctness and Purity of Russian Speech."

84
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,468
1911.

85
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:35,979
does not mark this word in any way, but the text itself contains two such very

86
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,699
very contradictory passages. On the one hand, the word "coffee"

87
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,599
is mentioned among the words which

88
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,719
"used generally in the middle gender," but it goes on to say that it is used

89
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,698
"chiefly in the masculine gender."

90
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,369
Now go figure it out.

91
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,779
Soviet normativizers did not radically change anything this time-they simply reprinted old recommendations.

92
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,459
No Soviet dictionary gave precedence to the Neuter gender, but it was mentioned everywhere as colloquial.

93
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,639
So the fact that since the 1980s they regularly say that they supposedly

94
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,079
"introduce new norms" are nothing more than newspaper ducks.

95
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,939
The last time this happened, I remember, was in 2009, when Act 195 was passed, with this

96
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,899
long name.

97
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,978
This law instructs us to use a dictionary in which the word coffee is marked as a neuter word

98
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:42,259
"Oh, there was an awful racket! Once again it was said that the era of the beautiful Russian syllable was over,

99
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,778
Education is ruined, and our children won't understand Pushkin.

100
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:54,639
It is not so much deplorable that someone writes such things, but so much that someone listens to this gibberish.

101
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,359
But news of this kind achieves its purpose.

102
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,099
It turns a linguistic phenomenon into a distinctly sociolinguistic one.

103
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,039
That's how "coffee it" became the clearest indicator

104
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,259
of illiteracy in the late Soviet era.

105
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,819
Look at this. Along with the neuter gender of the word "coffee,"

106
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:25,159
normative dictionaries also do not advise, say, such accents as znaemye, apostrophe, you need znaemye and apostrophe, respectively, and many other things,

107
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,059
but if someone says so, they won't even pay much attention to it, on the contrary.

108
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,499
rather be surprised when they learn that the dictionaries advise otherwise.

109
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,838
But to say in polite society.

110
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,059
"I had a good cup of coffee" is like stepping in shit and then

111
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,299
and then not washing your shoe - everyone will say:

112
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,959
"Ew, you're so illiterate!"

113
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,479
And those sons of bitches correct me, like.

114
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,819
"Remember, my friend, how to do it right! Or else you'll spend the rest of your life handing out keys!"

115
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,839
*music*

116
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,719
The word "coffee" in the 17th and 18th centuries

117
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,079
was borrowed in several forms from several foreign languages.

118
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,779
but in all languages the word was masculine

119
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,159
German: "Der Kaffe".

120
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,359
In French: "Le café"

121
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,639
Dutch: "Koffie."

122
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,019
This is why the pair "caffee"/"coffee" appeared - evidently from the Dutch sounding.

123
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:31,679
And the masculine gender was further supported by both the analogy with these words "koffie"/"coffee," and perhaps by the fact that most

124
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,379
of the authors of texts of the 18th and 19th centuries and the coffee drinkers themselves were educated people.

125
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,759
They knew foreign languages one way or another and may have had all these examples in their memory.

126
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,619
In Soviet times, when there were fewer connoisseurs of foreign languages, they found it expedient to use another explanation

127
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,859
that coffee is masculine because it's a drink.

128
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,609
This, of course, is a totally useless explanation, it only makes things worse.

129
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,139
and the discerning person immediately has a question:

130
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:15,859
"Well, okay, if coffee is a beverage and therefore is masculine, then why the middle gender of 'beer,' 'brandy,' 'sake,' 'cocoa' ?"

131
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,819
The reason the language doesn't want to contain such an exception and sort of

132
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,219
pushing us to use the neuter gender

133
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:34,139
is quite trivial - analogy, because if this exception doesn't have any semantic or grammatical function, we can get rid of it.

134
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,819
Since in Russian "E" words are exclusively Neuter words, we have two choices:

135
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,879
Either we keep the gender but change the ending and then we get "kofiy".

136
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,999
or we keep the ending, but we have to change the gender.

137
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,499
And that's how we get the inflected tasty "coffee."

138
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,329
Compare a similar example, where we get words that are feminine but

139
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,669
ending in a consonant, and there's no such thing in Russian.

140
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:10,779
The Soviet hippies had "gerla" in their jargon, because she's a "girl", which is not inflected.

141
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,099
French "madame" became "madame" in Russian,

142
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,599
and there's a Scandinavian name like "Ingeborg" which became "Ingeborga" on Russian soil.

143
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,419
And so did the Lithuanian language, which also doesn't have the corresponding types

144
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:33,129
consonantal declension of the feminine gender, but we call "Ingeborga" not only Lithuanians, like, well, the most famous one is probably the actress

145
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,739
Ingeborga Dapkunaite

146
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:42,969
We also call all sorts of Danish women Ingeborga, who actually have a name ending in a consonant.

147
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,969
At the beginning of the 20th century, "blinds" was a neuter word in the singular.

148
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,319
So Chernyshev writes:

149
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,359
"Open blinds."

150
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,439
Later on, however, it became a plural according to the Russian types of declension.

151
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,719
That is why there is absolutely no surprise that it is possible to celebrate the New Year "in Helsinki".

152
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,635
and the Olympics in Sochi.

153
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:12,159
That's what my dad says, and I often say it myself.

154
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,539
A curious example from the Polish language:

155
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,028
In Polish, the ending "e" is also a plural ending.

156
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:24,009
That's why "Google" can be understood as a plural word.

157
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,639
"Szukaj w googlach" - "Search in googlach".

158
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,749
Just as coffee was masculine in the past so were many other nowadays only neuter words

159
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,088
"cacao," "jabot," "coupe."

160
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,379
"piano," "piano," "auto," "coat," and others

161
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,969
Tolstoy

162
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,259
"This short man was wearing a white, leather apron that covered his chest and part of his legs,

163
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:58,379
around his neck was worn something like a necklace, and from behind the necklace protruded a tall, white jabot, which bordered his elongated face, lit from below."

164
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,379
Herzen

165
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:09,039
"It was a lean, tall man, much older than the first; he was almost all the same color, wearing a light green coat."

166
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,899
Discerning viewers will remember that there was such a video as "Conversation Three" on our channel

167
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,259
And so there was this girl Masha,

168
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,879
Who played the role of...

169
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,679
The student in the movie.

170
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,089
There's a funny story about her.

171
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:28,389
Many years ago she found out somewhere that the word "piano" used to be

172
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,409
and so, they say, it should be said until now.

173
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,879
Indeed, we find such a thing in old texts

174
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,499
Leskov

175
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,659
"Do you recognize it or not, our old piano?"

176
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,687
And everyone wondered then, how aristocratic it sounds.

177
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:46,539
"Black Piano."

178
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,659
But still, it's kind of weird.

179
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,759
I even found this unique photo

180
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:02,279
Where I'm on the right, Masha is there, you see, looking out in the distance. Between us stands the black piano in question

181
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,919
I, of course, started noticing that she talks like that

182
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:14,259
and I myself began to speak to her as another old dictionary, Nikolai Grech's "Reference Place of the Russian Word" of 1843, advises

183
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:21,239
He requires the words to be declined and says "playing the piano .

184
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,159
...but being able to play the piano, puts them to music worthy of their subject.

185
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:36,099
I must say that after a while Masha finally gave in to the nobility of her tones and began to speak as before

186
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,699
And one last example that is on many people's lips:

187
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,659
The word "subway" was once a masculine word, too, because it's short for

188
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,739
"Metropolitan."

189
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,939
There was a newspaper called Soviet Metro.

190
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:56,879
And it was even sung in a song:

191
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:10,879
"But the subway shone with its oak railings, at once it bewitched all the riders".

192
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,259
The word "coffee" has always been in the neuter gender. Moreover, it first entered the language in this form

193
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,569
There were periods when the neuter gender almost disappeared, but after a while it began to spread again

194
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,869
And it is the middle gender that is the future of the language.

195
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,149
If there's no public opinion.

196
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:36,979
of the mass-media and constant conversations at school, it will take a generation or two for the masculine gender to perish.

197
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:45,219
But, by the way, it is hardly possible in the next decade, and now all the literate people have already managed to teach masculinity.

198
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:55,359
Well, I personally lucky - I very rarely have to choose between saying "hot coffee" or "hot coffee".

199
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,599
I personally don't drink coffee or tea and I don't smoke tobacco.

200
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:06,198
And it's not even that I'm afraid of being attacked by the evil one, or that I'm desperate from God; no.

201
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,879
I just don't like it. That's all.

202
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,358
Well, brothers, sweet sisters.

203
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:13,859
Adieu!
