1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,338
Every language is constantly changing.  But what will be considered

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,928
“the clearest example of

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:13,388
illiteracy and ignorance”, and what will not be noticed at all, is a matter of fashion.

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:19,899
What the media will promote, in popular books, in public, they will notice.  What will be branded a hundred times as a

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,759
“mistake”, “half-literacy”, “colloquial”, will be considered as such in society,

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,348
even if until recently the intellectuals said so.

7
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:36,999
And the accent “call” is the clearest example of such promotion and fashion.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,199
Speech nuance

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,359
NUANCE 2 - Y

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:54,239
“HE CALLS”
AGAINST
“HE CALLS”

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,829
until the

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,099
1930s of the forties, both forms existed, the

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,749
old form was more usable, but the new one was perceived calmly, and

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,189
many even

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,489
highly educated people said so, but after the activation of the Soviet norm creators, Stalin’s time,

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,549
variability from something  one form is pressed, both are the only correct one, and all the rest are a

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:26,339
mistake, damage to the language, and so on, another and so on you call, he calls,

18
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:36,959
such famous people of the past as sergei yesenin, zinaida gippius boris pasternak, david samolov andrey platonov, most conveniently say

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,209
history  donations over the past two hundred and three hundred years to show on examples from poetry, I analyzed all the example from the corpus of texts of the

20
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,989
Russian couple there is a poetic corpus, that is, poetry and there is a logical accent, that is, not necessarily

21
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,029
poetry, maybe prose should be, it means that the original was stressed for the

22
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,709
first time  stress on the root of the word to call in any  of its forms

23
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,329
is found in

24
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,189
1910 and in general most of the use in the corpus is from

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,537
1910 to

26
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,519
1000 forties

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,818
out of 78 the use during this time

28
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,809
15-17 were with an emphasis on the root

29
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,809
1517 because there were two cases where you

30
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,919
seem to want to read in size just call but  if you say call, it will be a little

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,399
but a little out of size, but still, on the whole, it’s coherent,

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,639
however, most of the poems still have accents and friends, please note

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,479
17 out of 78, this is actually

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,189
21 percent,

35
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,659
you also need to remember about the

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:52,559
specifics of the corpus if something  didn’t get into the corpus before, this doesn’t mean that it didn’t exist before, and in general the very fact that

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,419
new stress is already appearing in poetry, that it is generally acceptable in print in

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,499
written speech and from says that even this stress was already clearly in speech

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,529
long accepted, that is, most likely it arose around the end of the nineteenth century

40
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,899
parsnips for the tenth year

41
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:19,619
again one full flat empty drop ringing post again a birch tear on further winter furrows of

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:38,939
springs  In 16 years, gently under the trembling of angelic wings, the crosses of the nameless graves of

43
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,949
Plato are ringing.

44
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:54,599
Samoylov 44 years old do not ring bells in Russia and whether it is necessary to ring the bells,

45
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,959
note that they do not ring, but whether it is necessary to call, we will talk about this a little later, the fact is that in modern

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,669
Russian this verb may not have 2 stress patterns, but as many as three  and

47
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,499
after the forties, new stress is less and less common, a

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,607
new surge is closer to perestroika, when the language

49
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:18,629
democratizes,

50
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:25,679
and in poetry, most likely, it deliberately democratizes literary norms to the evil of the Soviet dictatorship and

51
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,209
across censorship,

52
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:34,019
although of course for 50 years, but the stress has not disappeared anywhere, but thanks to  school and

53
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:41,129
propagandist of the correct Russian language in the mass consciousness, the connection of this stress with ignorance was fixed,

54
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:48,929
for example, in Soviet cinema  you can’t meet this accent, but it’s another matter, but who says

55
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,549
that,

56
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,299
it’s all simple people from the village who

57
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,799
obviously know a little about science,

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:08,278
so spin around, run around on the phone name to enter all the papers all these people all go

59
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,679
work

60
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:27,808
really can stop

61
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:31,978
right away I want to say that that  an

62
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:38,728
hour and a half lecture by Andrey Anatolich Zaliznyak is devoted to the same topic as the next part of the video, an episode from the history of Russian stress,

63
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:46,378
therefore, those who want to become proficient in the survey from all sides, I invite you to watch this

64
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,088
fascinating shiva video,

65
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,258
so

66
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,769
all Russian verbs in it have only one of three schemes  accents in

67
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,859
red we will designate the shock base on the diagram about the green shock ending,

68
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,188
let's call these diagrams for memory shirks not 1 2 3 so as not to get confused, but using

69
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:13,888
your usual words with a similar meaning, do not think that I want to scan the fuselage of their

70
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,308
listeners or cause bewilderment in  viewers of

71
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:20,579
venerable age, this is just a

72
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,468
mnemonic trick, the

73
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:27,088
emphasis is always on the roots  for example, the verb limonite, the

74
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:34,198
emphasis is always on the ending, for example, the verb to pick a pea, a bean, etc., and an

75
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,179
accent from a mixed scheme, a verb to masturbate

76
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,739
nothing reprehensible

77
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,598
friends, we even read a text behind the glacier with ourselves where our

78
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,728
wives taught with his hands three fields fool

79
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:58,168
science above prejudices that our perceptive viewer who  I watched the fourth video conversation,

80
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,228
to which I will also leave a link of the

81
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,049
possible already guessed that the three

82
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,138
stress patterns in the modern language are explained by the fact that

83
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,888
in the Old Russian language there could be three times accent markings about the root,

84
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:18,669
but the vast majority of our viewers, as I guess, did not watch this video

85
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,739
and therefore they do not understand  how the very accent markings work in general, what is it,

86
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,609
therefore, for simplicity, we will simply take it for granted that

87
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,539
there are 3 schemes in the modern language and that’s all, and

88
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,559
so in the Russian language from the 15th and 16th centuries

89
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,839
there has been a tendency

90
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,459
that the verbs of the scheme to pull begin to turn into the scheme to masturbate,

91
00:07:43,460 --> 00:08:15,289
for example, to  16th century they said only to drown the drowning

92
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:23,239
tapes  load sollers just turn it on turn it on turn it around and of course it’s variable and the jargon is

93
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,629
hanging out hanging out stupid stupid stupid posting and there are

94
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,879
so many words that it’s impossible to even fit them on the screen

95
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,048
some examples from old literature or from folk dialects

96
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:44,839
from kulaks and do not last hundreds of different times before  but thousands of them lie

97
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,179
on the

98
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,619
floor

99
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,859
on

100
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,559
but why doesn’t the teacher give the student a deuce when he says mom with a face

101
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:12,019
why flax catering intellectuals don’t curl their ears into a tube when they hear the phrase Santa Claus gives gifts to children

102
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,629
why why are journalists not under the carriages articles with names in the spirit

103
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,819
the new dictionary of the Russian language resolves the stress you smoke what is it

104
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,669
new  the norms of the Russian language or the crab of the education system, an

105
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,299
astute viewer should certainly note one nuance

106
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,289
all these verbs in which the stress has changed are

107
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,349
transitive verbs, that is, those after which you can put words in the accusative case

108
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,919
cook soup salt potatoes stew a cigarette butt smoke a cigarette roll a cigarette

109
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,609
thus stress in verbs  it’s a way to designate the

110
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,079
grammatical meaning of transitivity, not transitivity,

111
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,959
but after the verb call you can’t put a direct object, we don’t say

112
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,369
call who we say call who the dative case

113
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:19,379
can be assumed that this is why the Soviet norm of the palaces disliked the verb call because it, they say, is

114
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,429
out of the general  regularities but not everything is so simple

115
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:31,049
there are three explanations why the verb to call has changed its gift and personally I am more inclined to the latter the

116
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,699
first explanation is the

117
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,009
influence of Western languages

118
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,639
e in English I stuck samvadas in Fr

119
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,959
nch apple kol ken in German on roof elena d everywhere we have transitive verbs

120
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,059
 additionally  The

121
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:55,619
question arises why, at least until now, mostly calls say no, experts in

122
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:03,029
Western European languages are not intellectuals, but people, well, in my opinion, mainly from the south of Russia or from Ukraine, the secon

123
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,409
 explanation is th

124
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,129
 Ukrainian-Belarusian South-Russian influence of th

125
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,559
s very point of view  Andrey also adhered to Zaliznyak his

126
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:22,139
lectures, the fact is that in the Ukrainian and Belarusian languages the stress has shifted not only for transitive verbs, but also for intransitive ones, for e

127
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:29,249
ample, Russian please and Belarusian you take away or Russian you call, but Ukrainian you drive

128
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,269
away or co

129
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:36,839
pare some forms may fluctuate in Russian  they may not hesitate, but in Ukrainian and Belarusian, the

130
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,839
accent is only new, say Russian, they wrote send salt but paint only 100, or

131
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,879
it means Russian voice but Belarusian hair h or Russian

132
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,779
produce but Belarusian catch and,

133
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,209
accordingly, say in Belarusian

134
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,839
you pay or in Ukrainian

135
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,839
you call  it will be out of the norm

136
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,899
in this way in Ukrainian Belarusian  In English,

137
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,149
transitivity is not the transitivity of the verb, this is no longer the feature along which the

138
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,049
distinction between different stresses occurs in these languages, some of

139
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,759
their own patterns operate,

140
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,899
although

141
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:24,409
the same patterns under the influence of fraternal Slavic languages \u200b\u200bmay appear in Russian and there

142
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,899
are already the first swallows, for e

143
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,939
ample, in the second half  In the 20th century, when I couldn’t establish exactly

144
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:39,409
, the stress appeared, he’s friends instead, he’s friends, the stress shifted and the verb to is

145
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:46,369
intransitive, then I’ll eat off the tank of respect where to call whom to contact whom to complain about the

146
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:52,099
inaction of philologists on the face of

147
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,429
3 spring until the middle of the twentieth century, the verb to call was transitive

148
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,169
I myself fell  to this thought, when I studied an example from the corpus of texts,

149
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:11,359
now we mainly ring the telephone, but also the bell, the bell, all sorts of other similar objects, as well as the tram,

150
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,369
before the telephone appeared and, in general, the telephone became available to everyone,

151
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,489
in fact, the bell rang most often, and the bell

152
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:27,439
rang part of everything for my husband  not only does it make a sound, and the bell also does not just  then calls in this way a person wants to either inform about

153
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,359
something or call someone,

154
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,679
therefore, in the language of the 19th century, it was possible to call a servant

155
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,229
girl, post an alarm,

156
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:44,269
morning or evening, his eyes fell on martha, then on crying Zosima again on martha, call

157
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:51,019
vyacha and aunts do not  they could see the disorder that the flowers would spread out in Asia whimsically Anna Vasilievna entered

158
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,128
called the girl in the cap

159
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,378
ordered her brothers symmetry,

160
00:13:55,379 --> 00:14:00,298
however, the dream did not go away and the artist began to frantically ring the dresses

161
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,438
compare this whole situation with the word to bring down

162
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:09,418
there is a meaning to throw something and then the transitive verb

163
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:13,378
to bring down together on the ground  he knocks the bag down there is a

164
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:21,208
meaning without addition and here the emphasis does not change the same there were not a single line

165
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:29,938
that he was a training ground for us

166
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,538
and the

167
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,968
third meaning, it seems to me, for modern people, at least for my peers, the

168
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:46,978
most basic most frequency is to leave to leave despite the fact that  already the verb does not have a direct object,

169
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:50,758
it changes its stress in the same way as any other

170
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:57,868
transitive verb from e  of that group, for example, he brings down abroad or we bring down gas spore,

171
00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:02,698
so it can be assumed that in the Russian language of the future the

172
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:19,249
first or second meanings will become completely secondary;

173
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,289
and

174
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:29,929
I remember that the verb and go from the scheme to finger the scheme to masturbate on them the scheme of a lemon,

175
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,359
that is, one option, the

176
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:40,279
regularity of the point of view of the language is the stress call I call you call, but you don’t call evil, you don’t always call the roots,

177
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:47,659
but even here the question arises why the creators must have opposed both forms  they just don’t have this last

178
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,679
answer, I have a feeling that the

179
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,699
accent

180
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,819
call, call, call, this odds are more common among those for whom these forms are

181
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,049
native since childhood, for example, my grandmother says so,

182
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,619
call, call, call, I hear mostly and those who

183
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:22,609
deliberately speak in defiance  the norm, or who, with their own lips, voice for themselves a deliberately wrong

184
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:33,909
option, such is my em  If I'm wrong, please write me about it in the comments. The

185
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,869
emphasis he calls is the best example of how a

186
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,299
natural phenomenon in the development of a language

187
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,489
becomes the main target of the struggle for the correctness of speech. It becomes a

188
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,049
canonical example of

189
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:53,979
illiteracy.

190
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,189
funny

191
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,859
, firstly, we know that many educated people spoke like this at the beginning of the 20th century; secondly,

192
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:11,889
hundreds of words with the same linguistic change by native speakers are not recognized as something new, much less as something bad,

193
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,290
what are dear friends and now aufiderzein
