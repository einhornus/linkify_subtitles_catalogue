1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,559
Even since school we can recall that in Russian pronouns are personal -

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,555
are those that directly refer to the one who performs the action.

3
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:14,529
These are such words as "I", "you", "we", "you", "he", "she", "it", "they".

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,729
And then there are

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,459
possessive pronouns. They refer to something whose subject is: "my," "your," "our," "your."

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,899
These words can be modified: "my", "your", "your", "your", "from our".

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,499
However, from the words "he", "she", "it", "they"

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,019
possessive pronouns

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,659
are not formed.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:41,659
And the form "their" is not a possessive pronoun, but a genitive plural form

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,179
of the plural "they."

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,079
That is, it is already a case form in itself, it cannot once again

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,339
it cannot change its gender, number, and case.   To correct this unfortunate misunderstanding.

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,719
some people add the suffix -n-

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,859
and endings of possessive pronouns.

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,459
This is how not only the word "ikhni," but also "yevoniy" and "herni" appeared.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,739
*music* Speech nuance

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,219
Nuance 1.

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,019
"THEIR" versus "THEIR."

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,139
History of the word

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,139
The first time in a written text in Russian the word ikhni appears as early as

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,239
in 1595!

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,159
The first time the word ikh is found in the Russian written text, even in the year 1595, "They cheered us, but they said that in the past, in the ninety-fourth year,

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,619
they had taken a fiefdom, a town and an ostrog for us for the Siberian roads of their fathers".

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,799
Almost 200 years later a linguist speaks about this form for the first time.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,979
in 1788

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,539
in the "Russian Grammar" the scholar Barsov writes about it. He says that this form

28
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,859
is indeed widespread among the people, but nevertheless it

29
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,919
Nevertheless it is a colloquial form and anyway "is not adopted in common use".

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,259
However, during the whole 19th century the frequency of the use of this word becomes wider and wider,

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,038
And it becomes more and more neutral. Examples from literature.

32
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,459
Griboyedov:

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,999
- Is this your man?  - Ichnyi-s.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,519
Gogol:

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,239
"He's gone over to their side, he's all theirs now."

36
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,259
Notice how the author plays on style. In one sentence

37
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,359
both "their" and "theirs."

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,839
Tolstoy:

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,579
"And so I keep all the expense; and their German only smokes a pipe, and that is all."

40
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,859
However, in all these early examples from literature the word "ikh" is used by people of clearly

41
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,139
of low education. Those who do not speak

42
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,039
the literary language sufficiently. They are a servant,

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,999
a Zaporozhe Jew, a soldier-denier. Yes, it's a good device for conveying the speech

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,639
of the illiterate or rural population, but no more than that.

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,879
However, there was one lover of the word who put it even into the mouths of

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,919
of educated characters and could even write it himself.

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,059
"Kiss my children, my angels, my gods. Yours and theirs is all F. Dostoevsky."

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,799
Of course, in his texts Fyodor Mikhailovich wrote simply "them" dozens of times more often.

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,879
But for such a language game, it was sometimes possible to bring back a dashing folk word.

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,959
But by the early 20th century, even

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,399
serious people in serious texts without a blush on their face

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,219
to use the word "theirs." And it's not some subtle wordsmiths and acrobats of the pen,

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,779
they're people of a completely different profession, not writers,

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,339
not philologists. For example, Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev.

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,679
a chemist, a scientist. And Peter Alexeyevich Kropotkin.

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,159
a revolutionary.

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,299
"However, our hopes that these young men would become propagandists among the other

58
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,819
workers, whose situation is much worse than theirs, were not quite fulfilled."

59
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,679
"Lithuania and Poland for their many

60
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,499
pressures on our country, too, have paid the price of subjugation and partition, because Russian realism

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,959
is higher and stronger than their Latin-inspired beginnings."

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,959
But comes

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,679
Soviet power.

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,359
After all the twists and turns

65
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,159
language policy in the twenties, in the late

66
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,979
1930-х

67
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,939
The authorities come to a new conclusion - the language must be strictly rationed.

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,399
A lot of words with the dictionary markings "colloquial," "obl.", "dial.", "simple." are stigmatized.

69
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,939
School teachers, editors, dictionary compilers

70
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,479
deny them life.

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,279
And "theirs" falls into their ranks.

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,219
No matter what educational literature you open, it says "it's wrong" everywhere,

73
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,539
that "such words" supposedly "don't exist." As if anything has changed now!

74
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,559
Read more about language policy in the Soviet Union

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,259
and how attitudes towards the norm have changed throughout history,

76
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,959
you can see in the video "Conversation Two".

77
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,019
*music* How the word "IHNY" came about

78
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,319
Here we should immediately discard the assumption that the appearance of the word "ikhni" is

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,279
Ukrainian influence.

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,239
"Ikhni" is a word in itself, which became widespread

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,239
only with the light hand of the Soviet rulemakers of the 1920s.

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,459
Of course, this form existed before. But first, it was not considered

83
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,099
literary, and secondly, it was not predominant.

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,439
Exactly the same can be said of the Belarusian language

85
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,659
with its forums "yegny", "yagony", "ikhni".

86
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,559
Even rarer is the word "ichni" in Polish. Nevertheless, it is there.

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,539
It has never claimed to be a literary norm,

88
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,039
it has never been in wide use. And in writing, it has always been used only

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,599
to convey the speech of the villagers.

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,119
"The apostates are called Hussites, and it comes from their prophet Gus, not from geese at all."

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,539
Although in Polish, in any written text.

92
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,119
the word first appeared even earlier than in Russian.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:15,099
Back in the 15th century one can find not only the word "ichni" and not only "jejski" and "jegojski,

94
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,479
but even "twójski", "mojski", "naski", "waski".

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,459
At the very beginning of the video, we already mentioned that from the words "he", "she", "it", "they",

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,739
that is, third person pronouns,

97
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,739
forms of possessive pronouns are not formed.

98
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,199
But why?

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,559
Originally, this situation was characteristic of all Slavic languages without exception,

100
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,359
and, more broadly, all Indo-European!

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,179
Slavic, Germanic, Baltic, Romanic, Indo-Iranian, and others.

102
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,879
Look, now in Russian we have

103
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,759
third person personal pronouns, but

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,139
we don't have possessive pronouns; well, like there are none,

105
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,839
but even that wasn't always the case.

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,419
Once upon a time we didn't have third person personal pronouns either!

107
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,579
All of these words are derived from short forms of the word "oni."

108
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,959
Let us now turn our eyes to other ancient languages.

109
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,199
Latin.

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,699
Here are their personal and possessive pronouns:

111
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,579
ego - meus

112
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,839
tu - tUUs (*there's a reservation*)

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,999
nos - noster

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,679
vos - vester.

115
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,079
Personal pronouns and, consequently, third person possessive

116
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,299
are simply absent. Instead of them are used

117
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,739
hic", "ille" and others, which mean "that", "this".

118
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,579
Sanskrit.

119
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,499
aham - madīyaḥ

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,239
tvam - tvadīyaḥ

121
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,279
vayam - asmadīyaḥ

122
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,939
yūyam - yuṣmadīyaḥ.

123
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,159
There are simply no personal pronouns and hence no third person possessive pronouns.

124
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,259
The personal pronouns are replaced by "saḥ", "eṣaḥ"

125
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,179
and others that mean "that," "that."

126
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,059
Now let's look at modern languages!

127
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,899
French is a descendant of Latin and already has third person personal pronouns:

128
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,859
il, he, elle, she.

129
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,219
But they in turn come from the index Latin "ille", "illa".

130
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,339
"this," "this."

131
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,859
"their" in French is "leur.

132
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,899
This word comes directly from the Latin "illorum"-

133
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,259
"their" or "these."

134
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,719
It was, as in Russian, the genitive form of the

135
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,798
plural.

136
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,158
However, modern French also

137
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,079
literally says "theirs," that is, he modifies the word like adjectives.

138
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,038
For example,

139
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,939
"leurs amis" - their(their) friends

140
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,139
"leurs mots" - their(s) words.

141
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,919
If there is a hole in the language system, one wants unconsciously to fill it with something,

142
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,679
but if there are possessive pronouns

143
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,999
first and second person possessive pronouns, why don't we use similar models

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,439
why not also build third person forms?

145
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,999
Finally, let us take a curious example from the Baltic languages.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,999
Here is how Lenin said: "We will go the other way!", -

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,999
so would the Baltic languages.

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,999
They didn't make up words like "their", "her", "his",

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,999
they just removed the words "my", "your", "our", "your".

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,999
In Latvian, however, the words "my" and "your" still remain.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,999
For example, "mana sieva" - my wife

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,999
"tavs brālis" - your brother.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,999
But the words "our" and "your" no longer exist.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,999
For example,

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,999
"mūsu valdība" - our government.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,999
Literally it means "our government".

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,999
Or "jūsu nauda" - your money.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,999
Literally it is "your money".

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,499
And the Lithuanian language doesn't even leave the words "my," "your," anymore.

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,999
For example,

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,999
"mano nuotraukos" - my pictures,

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,499
"mano gynyba" - my defense,

163
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,999
"tavo problemos" - your problems.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,999
As we can see, the Baltic languages

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,999
have made their changes in exactly the same way by the so-called analogy.

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,999
But another thing is that this analogy went in a completely different direction

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,999
than most other European languages.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,499
* music plays* Bottom line.

169

The emergence of the word "ichni" in Slavic languages

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,999
is a natural and expected phenomenon.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,999
But it's worth remembering that any word, it doesn't float somewhere in the space

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,999
of thoughts and ideas, but it has its own peculiar both stylistic and social coloring.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,999
Therefore, whoever says that the word "ichni" does not have one's mind.

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,999
But whoever says you can use the word "Ichnyi",

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,999
we say to him, "You can, but be careful."

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,999
Arrivederci, friends!
