1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,734
The language frontier

2
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:16,584
Yes, I falled for him! He tried very hard,

3
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:18,859
but I remained dedicated to what I'm obliged to.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,079
This scandalous situation is just a fuss.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:30,679
A fortunate liaison is appreciated more than diplomatic successes or military victories in beau monde.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,159
Natalie remained cold-hearted even towards the Emperor.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:42,939
Let the audience think that only I was able to cuckold the curly-haired one!

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,839
That scoundrel has been following Natalie for a long time

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,679
I believe that she is faithful to me but how do I make the beau monde believe it?! Only by hazarding my life!

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,579
So it's the duel and as soon as possible!

11
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,059
In 1880 Ivan Turgenev on the occasion of opening Pushkin's monument said:

12
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,799
"There's no doubt that he had created our poetic, our literary language.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,899
And he alone had been carrying the burden of the two missions, which were separated by hundreds of years in other countries.

14
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,539
That is to say: to establish the language and to create the literature.

15
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,119
What a great man he was!

16
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,819
And died...like a hare.

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,699
Are you ready?

18
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,239
Come!

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,379
How did Pushkin change the Russian language?

20
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,899
For hundreds of years the Russian language has been pushed down by the Church-Slavonic

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,779
Peter the Great tried to reform the language but he didn't achieve any success.

22
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,299
And we must notice that he was the one who swoll the language by bringing too much foreign barocco words.

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,339
Not to tell it in front of the ladies, like some sort of an old galjoen (_the head of a ship where the toiled was placed_)

24
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,099
The language could've stayed polluted... But then Pushkin showed up.

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:09,439
Gifted by superb genius, like a divine plunger it was, he cleaned the language and got rid of many ramshackle and bad-sounding words

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,339
Pushkin himself was using a clear language, easily-comprehended by anyone.

27
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,219
That's why he is widely regarded as our language's reformer.

28
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,739
But is that really so?

29
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,959
Let's find out!

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,059
Is Pushkin the creator of modern Russian literary language?

31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:40,539
The more years pass since some great person's death, the easier it becomes to turn his life into a myth and exaggerate his achievments.

32
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,979
It started when Pushkin was still alive and reached its peak after 100 years since his death.

33
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,839
There was no Russian author who has been honoured as much as Pushkin has during the Soviet era.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,319
Pushkin was not only "the voice of the most avant-garde revolutionary minds of his time",

35
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,859
but also the creator of the Russian literary language.

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,419
Although, when reading the works of  Pushkin's contemporaries,

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,539
it's difficult to see why his language is called unique, what peculiarities his style has, why he is honoured so much.

38
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,179
An inexperienced reader won't notice any difference,

39
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:23,419
even a professional linguist has to make an effort to catch peculiarities of the Pushkin's style.

40
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,099
It's kind of weird when speaking about the one who "had established the language and created the literature", isn't it?

41
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:37,279
text: "What did Pushkin NOT do?"; voice: First of all, let's talk about what Pushkin certainly didn't do, but what he is believed to have done.

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,459
Pushkin didn't reform nor standardize the language (grammar)

43
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,279
It was unnecessary in Pushkin's times to standardize the language.

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,339
Of course, there still were some linguistic variations, but they are present even now.

45
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,039
But in Pushkin's times there was no chance of encountering such things in a text that were widespread in the beginning-mid. 18th cen.

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,859
That is to say: mixing colloquial speech, Church-Slavonic, formal language and new European words and calques.

47
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,659
Here's an example taken from a Peter the First's times romance adventure novel:

48
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,019
Red are the words that were no longer used in everyday life, those were the Church-Slavonic ones.

49
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,059
Dark-blue is the formal style's word, yellow are the new European words

50
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,299
"At ye same timeth (red) they marched  (yellow) them and told them to bring more joung sailors (y) to Holland

51
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,559
for the sake of arithmetic (y) science and various languages;

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,559
not enwheeling (r) this very (dark-blue) Vasily, who wasn't set up as a commander (y) above the sailiors, but wast hath left (r) in Kronstadt"

53
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,399
Such mixings step by step disappeared to the middle of the 18th cen.

54
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,959
Lomonosov put an end to these frivolousnesses.

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,699
His "Russian grammar" (1755) is a guide to what forms to use and what not to.

56
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,839
This means that in Pushkin's times there was no question of standardizing the grammar of the literary language anymore.

57
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,399
It has already been structured and there aren't  even much differences compared to the modern one.

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,919
During Pushkin's youth there were the same Russian grammar standards in all the secular educational institutions.

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,059
The grammar of Pushkin's writings is no different from his contemporaries'.

60
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,379
We have to keep in mind that Pushkin wasn't a linguist

61
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,439
He didn't publish any grammar books,  dictionaries, vade mecums nor grammar-guides.

62
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,439
Indeed, Pushkin took part in the language discussions, but his remarks were rather vague and unspecified.

63
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,219
We'll have a look at them later.

64
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,199
Pushkin didn't change Russian syntax

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,839
A peculiarity of the 18th century's texts is that their word order is very unusual to a modern reader

66
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,859
Church-Slavonic, Latin, Greek, German, French influences are all mixed together there.

67
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,139
And the tendency to make the prose more poetic and sophisticated in barocco style.

68
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,339
Let's look at this piece of Tredyakovsky's text

69
00:05:49,340 --> 00:06:00,179
From the bottom of my heart I wish this, even though it's not the main aim and need now, but as it has firmly and loudly plenties and plenties of nations, and stronger than any other thing, as I suppose, and it's hard to believe otherwise,

70
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,599
because if the palm branch, received for noble deeds, ...

71
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:12,419
has been praising them [the deeds] for centuries, then this exalting science shall bloom there as a magnifying epic horn, as some strings that have already been blooming with the clangs

72
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,619
*I've chosen a very bright example on purpose

73
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:26,139
(the texts weren't usually so hard)          
 So, Sasha, tell me what do you think of this quatation's tongue and how do you understand it?

74
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,959
...though it's not the main aim and need now...

75
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,039
What is it? What is he talking about?

76
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,579
Seems like the epithets are overused there... A bit of too much.

77
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,859
Nah, it's insane.

78
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,119
I don't get it at all, which parts of it are connected.

79
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,379
Even Latin poems are easier to comprehend than this nonsense.

80
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:53,319
What was in his brains... It's like he's making a wedding speech.

81
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,619
As you can see, it's impossible to understand such things when reading it for the first time

82
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,099
To speak in such a manner, e.g. reading a lecture, is just unreal because it sounds like rubbish.

83
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,319
And it's not the age of this text that makes it hard -- the contemporaries struggled to understand it, too.

84
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,999
In those times the form and beauty of the text were more important than its clear meaning.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,939
A confusing word order was regarded as very solemn and beautiful.

86
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,339
Lots of people have been crying over it...

87
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,639
but they didn't stop using this manner until the end of the 18th cen.

88
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,919
Even Lomonosov couldn't help making the syntax easier

89
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,399
On the opposite, he recommends to use this style when writing something highly poetic

90
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,239
And the word order in his writings is way not that easy, too.

91
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,439
Karamzin totally changed the situation.

92
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,999
He paid no attention to Lomonosov's rules and created his own.

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,319
On the one hand, he used French phrasing as a model because it had direct word order, logical way of expressing a thought and it was quite short.

94
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,859
On the other, there was a Russian colloquial model.

95
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,579
Therefore Pushkin and the others used the syntax that Karamzin had brought into life

96
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,259
N.M. Karamzin (1766-1826) a writer, historian

97
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,779
Pushkin admitted that he was Karamzin's successor and considered Karamzin to be the main reformer of the Russian language.

98
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,179
An example from Karamzin's text.

99
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,319
You'll see that the sentences are short enough and the subordinate clauses aren't very long.

100
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,219
The meaning is easily understood even without looking at the text.

101
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,659
It was also important to Karamzin that beau monde ladies would understand his tongue.

102
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,459
Because the casuistic way of speaking could've abolished their desire to read anymore.

103
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:37,058
Liza's father was a rather well-to-do settler, for he loved
work, tilled the land well, and always led a sober life. But soon after his death, his wife and daughter grew poor...

104
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:52,859
The lazy hand of a hired man worked the land poorly, and the grain ceased to thrive. They were forced to rent out their land, and for a pittance of a sum

105
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,119
There was a poet Ivan Semyonovich Barkov

106
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,379
And his relationships with Pushkin were, so to say, pretty cold.

107
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,839
An anecdote

108
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,239
Once upon a time Pushkin had been writing some poems and suddenly he saw Ivan Semyonovich walking  outside

109
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:18,359
Pushkin thought, 'Now I'll make it hot for Barkov. I'll take a 5 ruble coin, heat it up, drop it at Barkov's feet, he'll try to catch it and get his hands burned. What an unspleasant situation!

110
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,979
And then, when the coin is cold again, I'll take it'.

111
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,839
Please keep in mind, that 5 rubles was a huge sum back in the days.

112
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,979
And so Pushkin did what he had planned.

113
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,199
He took a 5 ruble coin, heated it up,  dropped it at Barkov's feet and Barkov had almost caught it,

114
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,979
but he felt that the coin was very hot, and if he cathes it, he'll burn his hands, drop the coin and it'll be an unpleasant situation, ideed.

115
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,559
Barkov looked up and saw smiling Pushkin in the window.

116
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,319
Barkov thought, 'Now I'll make it hot for Pushkin.

117
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,199
I'll cool the coin down with my "jet", naturally I won't take it and just go on walking.

118
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,199
I won't lose a thing, I'll give Pushkin what for, plus he'll lose some money "

119
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,839
because he won't risk his "aristocracies' honour" by taking a peed coin

120
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,999
And so Barkov did what he had planned.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,879
He unzipped his pants, peed on the coin and went on walking.

122
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:14,219
That's the story how Barkov didn't let Pushkin mock him and made Pushkin lose money instead.

123
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,539
Pushkin didn't get rid of Church-Slavonic words in Russian language

124
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,179
Church-Slavonic language had a huge impact on Russian language ever since the Christianization

125
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,819
We have a video about it.

126
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,259
Just in case you forgot: "Church-Slavism" and "Slavism" are the same categories.

127
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,899
We'll use the second one just because it's shorter.

128
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,579
Archaic elements of grammar and syntax like "пpиимаша"(taketh), "погребох" (inurn),

129
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,279
"похотел бысть" (did want to), "едущу ему" (traveleth to that gent) etc.

130
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,539
weren't used anymore in written language up to the mid. 18th century.

131
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,899
Lomonosov's grammar was the cherry on the cake in fighting this shabby tongue.

132
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,819
But until Pushkin's times there was an argue going on about Church-Slavonic lexis

133
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,859
The written language of those times was even called "Slavonic-Russian".

134
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,919
Because he included so many slavisms.

135
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,339
Many words were written in texts in two ways: in Russian and in Slavonic.

136
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,539
It's easy to demonstrate slavisms by naming body parts

137
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,819
And the first group is those words that aren't like the Russian ones.

138
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,874
"очи" (eyes), "рамена" (shoulders),

139
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,434
"персты" (fingers),

140
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:23,634
"ланиты" (cheeks), "чресла" (loins),

141
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,234
"выя" (neck),

142
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,124
"перси" (bosom),

143
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,759
"чело" (forehead),

144
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,359
The second group is slavisms that have the same-root Russian words

145
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,419
"голова -- глава" (head),

146
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,739
"борода -- брада" (beard),

147
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,779
"волосы -- власы" (hair),

148
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,959
"длань -- долонь -- i.e. ладонь" (palm)

149
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,399
Up to Pushkin's times there were two types of slavisms:

150
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,639
'Marked', regarded by everyone as ecclesiastical

151
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:06,859
in vain, how much/many, night, to crave, gold, nowadays, to speak, trees, and so on.

152
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,939
'Unmarked', etymologically Slavonic words that have been used in everyday speech for many years

153
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,759
younger, guard,

154
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,239
to congratulate, seeing, and so on.

155
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,659
During Pushkin's youth there were two huge literary societies: Shishkovist and Karamzinist.

156
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,379
Their dispute was based on totally different ways of looking at the Church-Slavonic inheritance.

157
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,799
Young Karamzin regarded slavisms as alien elements,

158
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,619
pathological mixing of uncombinable things,

159
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,599
a dump, macédoine

160
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,479
A.S. Shishkov (1754-1841) an admiral, writer

161
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,959
Shishkov thought that Russian and Church-Slavonic are basically the same language, they just differ in styles

162
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,219
And the so-called slavisms are the main treasure of the language, they are more beautiful and have deeper meaning.

163
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,239
I have to say that those views were mostly declarative (=those authors didn't strictly follow them)

164
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,639
And the vocabularies of both authors are almost equal.

165
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,839
Yes!

166
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,639
You may notice that Shishkov tends to use literary words more often,

167
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,559
but they are still used in modern language and easily comprehended by everyone.

168
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:21,659
There were some funny situations, e.g. it's said that Shishkov was pathologically afraid of foreign words and he invented the word "мокроступы" in order to avoid using "galoche".

169
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,659
But it's just an overforced pearl of his,

170
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,554
Actually Shishkov's tongue was of no diffecence to the other authors of the late 18-19th centuries.

171
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:31,254
He didn't use old grammar models

172
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:34,324
nor archaic and confusing slavisms that would've been hard to understand

173
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:39,459
and hard not only to his contemporaries, but to us, too.

174
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,899
and we still read his works easily.

175
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,119
Karamzin's tongue seems easier than Shishkov's,

176
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,079
but he also used a lot of slavisms,

177
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,859
but there are such sentences in his texts, that you'll have to read twice to understand.

178
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,599
Besides, late Karamzin isn't that enthusiastic about the reformation of the language anymore,

179
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,719
and he started using the slavisms that he used to avoid when he was younger,

180
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,539
and correcting his earlier works.

181
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,079
He wrote 'History of the Russian State'

182
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,099
(the main and his most long work), where it was appropriate to use slavisms for the atmosphere of the old times.

183
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,419
Technically, Pushkin didn't belong to any of the literary societies,

184
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,479
but, of course, he is closer to the late-Karamzin style.

185
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:34,299
Sasha, you've told me that you like the works of Chekhov, Gogol, Goncharov, Chernyshevsky

186
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,939
Tell me now, who would you prefer as a man out of Russian authors?

187
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,559
Oh, that's a good question,

188
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,399
to be honest, I can definitely say that it's not Tolstoy,

189
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,339
our views differ too much, and that idée fixe of his about the morality...

190
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,594
well... definitely not Lermontov

191
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:57,464
he's acting like an "eternal martyr" and is a whiny

192
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:00,999
not my type of man...

193
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,279
But... maybe Pushkin. He is such an open person, you know,

194
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,379
he's simple,

195
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:14,219
has sense of humour and, judging by his works and correspondence, I feel like he's a sunshine person.

196
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:21,559
Pushkin's main principle

197
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:29,919
"The true taste is not to thoughtlessly reject some word, some phrase, but to use everything appropriately, not too much nor too little" A. Pushkin

198
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,339
Pushkin avoided any kids of overusages or radical ideas when speaking about the language

199
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,534
He was like the ancient wisemen, who considered temperance to be the greatest virtue

200
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,979
He is against using too many foreign words,

201
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,739
but he criticizes those who want to get rid of all of them

202
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,704
He doesn't deny the Church-Slavonic literary inheritance,

203
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,584
but he also uses colloquialisms.

204
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:52,839
He can describe some miserable things using highly poetic style,

205
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,599
and he can describe some "higher matters" (i.e. moral, heroic etc.) using everyday speech.

206
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,159
Pushkin doesn't strictly follow all the grammar rules and dictionaries' commandments,

207
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,479
but he criticizes those who use vulgar argot, dialectisms, misuse grammar rules and write in an unnatural manner.

208
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,679
Pushkin relies on his taste and feeling of the language

209
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,599
We can look at any of his texts, at any expression,

210
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,479
but firstly we have to think, how suitable it is in this particular work,

211
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,799
how it looks in this particular context.

212
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,299
What have Pushkin done?

213
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,059
During his times there were the following linguistic debates going on:

214
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,899
What do we do with slavisms?

215
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,659
Joung Pushkin tended to reject the poetic Slavonic style,

216
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,719
'a source of dark barbarianism'.

217
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,259
In his poetry he used Russian and Slavonic words interchangeably according to the rhyme and syllabo-tonic needs.

218
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,699
Not only he did so.

219
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,019
Most of the poets did the same thing in those times.

220
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,679
But approximately during his 25's, he changed his mind about the Slavonic style

221
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,599
and had a special opinion on slavisms,

222
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,719
now we'll look at it.

223
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,719
Pushkin wasn't a linguist, therefore he made no difference between Russian and Slavonic words.

224
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,858
Lunguists were able to deduce the origin of a word in those times,

225
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,979
but some scientifical reasonings were of no use to Pushkin.

226
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,519
Pushkin had a different point of view on lexis.

227
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,539
Etimologically 'unmarked' words Pushkin regarded as inevitable archaisms.

228
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,078
You can't correct them, but anyways you don't need to,

229
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,124
because only a maniac would state that one has to use 'охлажать' instead of 'охлаждать' (to cool down),

230
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,819
and 'здоровствуйте' instead of 'здравствуйте' (hello).

231
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,499
'Marked' slavisms Pushkin was using in such a semantic styling

232
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,879
that these words received during the past decades.

233
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,839
He used cautiously only such slavisms

234
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,659
that were strictly associated with church or Bible.

235
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,899
All the other slavisms seemed totally fine to him,

236
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,199
he used them depending on the stylistic requirements of a particular text.

237
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,459
Slavisms had one stubborn function in poetry by that time,

238
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,899
they made the atmosphere of a text highly poetic,

239
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,899
as Lomonosov had bequeathed.

240
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,539
The 18th and 19th centuries had the following difference:

241
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:11,139
in the 18th cen. slavisms were a must-have when speaking about something serious, some "higher matters", it was impossible not to use them

242
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,119
Pushkin wanted to distract the audience from the idea

243
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,399
that if the text contains slavisms, it's automatically about a serious subject. And vice versa.

244
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,539
Pushkin regarded slavisms as a literary instrument which you can apply -- and can not apply.

245
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:32,759
An example of a "higher matters" speech (Tzar's monologue) where 'marked' slavisms (red) are used

246
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,999
alongside with Russian colloquialisms (blue).

247
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,619
Even so 'in youth' (blue)
   We 'greedily desire' (red) the joys of love, 
  But 'only' (blue) quell 'the hunger' (red) of the heart

248
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,179
With momentary possession. We 'grow cold' (red),
   Grow weary and oppressed!

249
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,979
God sent 'a famine' (red); perishing in torments
   The people 'uttered moan' (blue).

250
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,059
The granaries
   I made them 'free of' (red), scattered 'gold' (red) among them,
   Found labour for them;

251
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,839
all things 'revolt' (blue) me,
   And my 'head' (blue) whirls, and in my 'eyes' (blue) are children
   Dripping with blood;

252
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,859
The contemporaries often criticized Pushkin for such 'mashups'.

253
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,959
E.g.: a "Vestnik Evropy"'s ("Herald of Europe", a magazine) critic wrote in 1821,

254
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,779
"the throne is mined" and "the dropped altar" insted of "subverted" or "shattered" «...»

255
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:24,099
What a weird word usage -- to talk about such awe-inspiring higher matters using these miserable words.

256
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:31,179
Many critics attacked Pushkin because of a line from 'Ruslan and Lyudmila': 'screwing my eyes up in disgust' ("от ужаса зажмуря очи")

257
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,999
One more example

258
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,819
"The words 'moustache', 'to scream', 'Mazepa', 'ogo' (an exclamation), 'it's about time' seemed vulgar, burlak-like to the critics. What shall I do?!"

259
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,599
Even though critics were spitting and squealing like pigs,

260
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,919
it was the Pushkin's way of treating slavisms that eventually "won the literary contest" and became essential in the 19th cen.

261
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,859
How do we deal with colloquialisms, dialects and vulgar words?

262
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,359
It's often believed and attributed to Pushkin's merits that he has brought the written language and the everyday speech close together.

263
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,979
In a way it's true .

264
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,359
Let's look at what Pushkin himself said about it:

265
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,979
"The everyday speech of those simple people who don't read foreign books

266
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,899
and, thanks be to God, don't speak out in French, as we do,

267
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,379
is also worth of deeper researches".

268
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:26,139
"Ye young writers, listen to the vulgar speech -- you'll learn a lot, you won't find such things in our journals".

269
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:33,159
"The study of old songs, faitytales etc. is necessary if you want to know the Russian language and its features.

270
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,019
It's a great omission that our critics manquer it".

271
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,859
But Pushkin didn't bring his idea to a logical conclusion.

272
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,359
Pushkin isn't a language revolutionary.

273
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,259
He didn't want to throw away all the old traditions and build up a new literary language,

274
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,939
this was the thing that some of the bolsheviks in the 20's wanted to do, for example.

275
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,199
"The written language comes alive every time some phrases, that had been born in a conversation, are used,

276
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,239
but it also shouldn't leave out the things, that had been gained during the previous centuries".

277
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,719
Pushkin wasn't trying to write in a vernacular manner on purpose

278
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,039
he used peasants' and bourgeois' way of speaking just as a matter of stylization.

279
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,939
It was appropriate in some contexts, but in the others it was not.

280
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,699
And yes, or at least he said so, Pushkin appreciated vernacular language more

281
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,539
than that of an upper class

282
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,074
or forein languages, and that was the difference between Pushkin and Karamzin.

283
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:22,959
Karamzin, as we've already mentioned, kept beau monde ladies in mind,

284
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,079
and they could've uttered their subtle "ugh!",

285
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,859
when hearing a harsh peasant word.

286
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,519
Don't you agree, that it's quite offensive, if the whole text is written in an elegant, sophisticated manner,

287
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,139
and then, 'OOPS! Here comes a naughty vulgar word',

288
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,719
and you've spoilt it all! (literally: you've dipped the raspberry in shit!)

289
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,519
During the Soviet era they attributed Pushkin's vernacular word usage to his special love to the lower classes

290
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,919
But actually it was because of the zeitgeist.

291
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,399
It was one of the romanticism's traits -- which was at its peak during Pushkin's youth --

292
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,459
to pay special attention to the so-called 'national spirit', der Volksgeist.

293
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:08,919
We have a video where we are talking about this idea's influence. There's a link in the description.

294
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,279
Johann Herder, a German philosopher, came up with this idea at first.

295
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,199
And then Friedrich Hegel, who was popular in Russia, developed and spread it.

296
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,179
The 'Volksgeist' idea is that every nation has its own unique spirit

297
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,899
and, inter alia, it is present in this nation's  language.

298
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,639
But it's a metaphysical category,

299
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,379
one can't perceive it with eyes nor rationally understand.

300
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,179
So. Pushkin didn't use all the vulgar words, but chose them cautiously.

301
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:40,999
He didn't use harsh vulgarisms: 'to get drunk', 'to souse' (=to get drunk), 'to bang' (=to have sex), 'to fress', 'lofty', 'snout';

302
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,879
and the words that had already been regarded as vernacularism: 'in the meantime', 'let sth be', 'slippery', 'to be afraid';

303
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,279
and dialectisms: 'beauty',  'cockerel', 'beet', '?', 'an insect', 'fall' (rope)

304
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,079
When using dialectisms, Pushkin chose such words, which were understood throughout the country:

305
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,919
'wherefore', 'to rustle', 'to start', 'yesterday'.

306
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,119
An example from 'Mistress into Maid':

307
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:16,239
Pushkin changed dialectical pronunciation in the final version of the text: 'You even call your dog in French' (standard variant: по-французски) > 'You even call your dog in a foreign tongue'.

308
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,439
'And wha do you think?' > 'And whut do you think?' > ''And what do you think?'

309
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,539
And here's the example of how Pushkin made a poem's line simpler:

310
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:34,059
'and chestnut horse, whilst feeling it' > 'and gaunt horse, whilst feeling it' > 'a horse of his, while feeling snow'

311
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,359
You could use vernacular language not only when writing about folklore, rural life and so on,

312
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,519
but also when writing a review, in author's speech.

313
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,939
If the phrase is emotional and full of ardour -- why not?

314
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,339
"Firsly, they told me, that 'no one have ever heard such a thing' (red) that a woman could fall in love with an old man'.

315
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,139
Of course, vernacular language have been used in literature before,

316
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,919
and not only in entertaining contexts, but in serious ones, too.

317
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,639
But, firstly,

318
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,039
after Pushkin it blew up, you know, because of the romanticism influence.

319
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,079
Secondly, Pushkin showed in his texts that it's totally normal to use vernacular language in author's speech,

320
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,119
when talking about something serious or even the 'higher matters'.

321
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,319
And if such a great poet as Pushkin himself does so,

322
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,119
then the others can do it freely, too.

323
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,159
Thirdly, Pushkin often replied to critics

324
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,679
and gave reasons for his literary methods.

325
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,139
Thus, in Pushkin's time mixing styles wasn't regarded as burlesque,

326
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,999
as a macedoine used for comical effect,

327
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,999
but as a reasonable literary styling.

328
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,439
Pushkin!

329
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,539
This freedom-loving hero who mocked tsarism,

330
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,939
this intransigent fighter against serfdom,

331
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,219
it was impossible for him not to anchor in memoria populi.

332
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:07,939
Songs, legends, tales and fables about the greatest poet have been luring folklorist for a long time.

333
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,399
A lively source of a national legend about Pushkin

334
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,319
is discovered in Ivanovo Oblast during the eve of the dramatic loss of the poet.

335
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:37,059
It will now be presented to you by the sovkhoz's ensemble "The Krasny Khleborob" ("the Red Cultivator").

336
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,419
Lots and lots of those books had // Our lil' Marfusha.

337
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:51,419
There was once a great poet // And his name was Pushkin.

338
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,099
From Ivanovo they sent // Poems with no doubt.

339
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:05,679
My beloved and I have read // Pushkin all throughout.

340
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,439
We would like to tell you guys, // Who has love and feelings

341
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,119
Love would be a paradise // if you're Pushkin reading.

342
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,079
How do we deal with foreign words?

343
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,259
Pushkin's first language was French.

344
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,179
Aristocracies spoke French way more often than Russian.

345
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,979
Pushkin's correspondence with his friend and family was written in French.

346
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,639
Pushkin wrote poems in French.

347
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,319
Pushkin read French literature in the original.

348
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,119
When he had grown old, he learned English and some other languages.

349
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,899
You can encounter French calques in his works.

350
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,479
For instance, this is definitely not Russian word odred:

351
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,419
"But instead Nikolay and Alexander Raevsky and I, we had a pleasure laughing at him"

352
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,504
Look closer, and you'll undoubtedly hear this:

353
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:04,339


354
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,979
Puskin didn't like meaningless language puritanism.

355
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,099
He certainly made fun of those 'purga lingua' warriors.

356
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,039
His most famous quotation about it was:

357
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,479
She seems the image, to excess,
Of comme il faut… (Shiskov, forgive:
I can’t translate that, as I live!)

358
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,859
Pushkin thought that if you can't thanslate the word, you can easily borrow it as it is.

359
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,539
Frac, gilet, pantalon, tricot -- how do you thanslate these?

360
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,739
No way!

361
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,679
Pushkin understood that there were life spheres which were developed in Europe way more than in Russia.

362
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,739
Namely science, politics, philosophy, economics, technology, fashion.

363
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,679
And Pushkin saw nothing wrong with borrowing words from those spheres.

364
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,179
It was better to borrow some of the scientific terminology,

365
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,759
than to admit that they didn't talk about it in Russian

366
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,139
and to switch to German in order to continue the discussion instead.

367
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,759
But if the Russian word had already been existing, one mustn't use a foreign one instead.

368
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:02,339
"Avoid the scientific terminology; try to translate it, to paraphrase: this would be a ignoramus' pleasure and our young language's profit".

369
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,599
What is more important: to write elegantly or to write short and straight to the point?

370
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,399
"The beauty of simplicity is too complicated to us for now, and even in prose we are still trying to add lots of shabby literary decorations..."

371
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:22,539
"Certainty and conciseness are the most important qualities of prose. It requires thoughts and thoughts, and without them the fanciest decorations would be of no use".

372
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,759
We've alredy mentioned that in the 18th cen. it was widely believed

373
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,699
that the beauty of a text is more important than its comprehension.

374
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,659
Some people still had this opinion in the beginning of the 19th. cen.

375
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,019
The great advantage of Karamzin's prose was  that its word order was quite easy to understand.

376
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,659
But the disadvantage was that Karamzin overused various decorations in the text,

377
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,139
and those decorations often made the meaning obscure.

378
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,879
The moon is shining -- "Pale Hecate is reflecting dim gleams".

379
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,599
Windows were covered with frost -- "A furious aged woman covered windows with drawings"

380
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,539
Karamzin understood it himself and ironised it.

381
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:05,679
"A north wind blew hard upon a tender bust of a gentle mother, and the genius of her life extinguished its torch!

382
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,639
Yes, my dear gentle reader, she fell ill".

383
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,159
Pushkin couldn't stand such decorations

384
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,499
und used them only when it was inevitably necessary.

385
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,359
"I'm reading a show report by some theatregoer,

386
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,239
'This juvenile foster daughter of Thalia and Melpomene,

387
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,299
generously gifted by Apol...'

388
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,059
Oh my God! Couldn't you just say, 'this young great actress', and go on.

389
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:32,299
I assure you, no one will notice your exalted remarks, no one will thank you for it".

390
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,359
"These people would never say 'friendship' without adding

391
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,039
'this holy feeling, which noble fire...' etc.

392
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,899
One should've said 'early in the morning',

393
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,359
but they write 'as soon as first beams of the rising sun illuminated the eastern edge of the cerulean sky'

394
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,079
Oh my, it's so new and fresh! Does it seem better just because it's longer?'

395
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,839
Pushkin tried to avoid using such language constructions, which made comprehension of the text  more difficult.

396
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,379
Long sentences, inversions (anastrophes),  complicated metaphors, etc.

397
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,259
It is also known, that lots of adjectives and other modifiers

398
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,879
make a narrative slower.

399
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,299
From the other hand, lots of verbs, hence more actions,

400
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,959
make the narrative more dynamic, and the plot is easily imagined.

401
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,084
Pushkin knew it.

402
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:16,279
Here's a good example,

403
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,119
'The door was locked; he rang, and a few seconds of painful anticipation followed.

404
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,179
The clanking of a key could be heard, and the door opened.

405
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,619
"Does Avdotia Samsonovna live here?" he asked.

406
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,239
"Yes, she does," answered the young maidservant. "What do you want with her?"

407
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,079
The stationmaster went through to the hall without answering.

408
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,639
"You can't, you mustn't!" shouted the maid after him. "Avdotia Samsonovna has visitors."

409
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,859
Pushkin was trying to use short sentences and straight word order (SVO).

410
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,319
But Karamzin advised to do the very same thing.

411
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,039
The difference was that Pushkin reduced the amount of modifiers,

412
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,359
metaphors and other decorations.

413
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,759
So Pushkin among his contemporary writers was sort of Dovlatov

414
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,319
The narrative was cool and lively, it was easy and fast to read, everything was clear.

415
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,899
I suppose, my dear audience, that there are no fools among you.

416
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,219
And that all of you are people of intellect, not blind faith.

417
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,779
Then here's a question for you,

418
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,799
Who is our authority in the field of so-called social norms?

419
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,559
You'd say, 'Literate people'.

420
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,819
But who are those literate people? Pushkin? Tolstoy?

421
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,319
Or maybe even Vinogradov himself and K.G. Paustovsky?

422
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,819
Only we, the face of our time, are!

423
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,739
The horn of our time enunciates us as the modern literature

424
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,379
The past is narrow! Academics, Pushkin are as vague as hieroglyphs!

425
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,639
Throw Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky off the steamer of modernity!

426
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,559
The one who won't forget his first love, won't taste the last one!

427
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,459
How will the Russian language be split into different styles?

428
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,019
The most common opinion is that before Pushkin, using Lomonosov's system,

429
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,859
Russian language had had three styles:

430
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,219
high, middle and low.

431
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,579
And Pushkin just took the 'middle' style and extended the range of its literary devices.

432
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,659
That's how modern Russian literary language was born,

433
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,219
other modern styles are based on it:

434
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,959
scientific, journalistic, officialese, etc.

435
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,679
This opinion is only partially true.

436
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,839
The truth is that Pushkin and many of his contemporaries really thought that there were three styles

437
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,864
The falsehood is that in real life it was way not so.

438
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:25,244
It was just a theoretical construction of Lomonosov,

439
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:29,519
even though, yes, important to the culture and people of its time.

440
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,659
Almost immediately after the Lomonosov's theory had emerged it was obvious that...well...

441
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,699
there are almost no works with 'pure' style.

442
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,339
Moreover, there were no stylistic dictionaries nor manuals.

443
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,959
Lomonosov gave some references, mostly about grammar.

444
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,019
But there were no strict borderlines.

445
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,219
It was up to every author's own understanding.

446
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,199
And the 'middle style' is a total fiction,

447
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,559
because it just contains the words that weren't regarded as 'high' nor 'low',

448
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,379
so it wasn't something that the 18th cen. linguists defined as the 'middle style',

449
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,639
those were the leftovers that the linguists ignored while developing 'high' and 'low' styles.

450
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,339
In the 18th cen. fiction the 'middle style' was scarcely used.

451
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:16,319
The 'middle style' back then was used in journalism, scientifical writing and so on.

452
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,019
The 'middle style' authors didn't have to use some special words,

453
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,979
they didn't care about the styles nor deliberate tongue.

454
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,359
In the history, as a rule, the fiction's language is the one

455
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,999
which influences so-called 'middle style' texts,

456
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,299
I mean, the tongue of non-fictional texts.

457
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,479
Not vice versa.

458
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,939
Significantly 'high' or 'low' words,

459
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,719
while being used often, become more neutral.

460
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,419
E.g., words 'gritting', 'ghost', 'to imagine', 'to dare', 'to hope for'

461
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,139
used to be of the same category as 'in vain', 'inasmuch as', 'the dearest' (archaic)

462
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,759
However in the 'Dictionary of the Russian Academy' (1794)

463
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,319
the following words were marked as 'colloqialisms':

464
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:08,399
'a pauper', 'routine', 'greedy', 'persistent', 'to allude', 'haughty', 'youth', 'luck', 'to dirty', 'to judge', 'that'

465
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,644
Pushkin opens the realism in Russian literature.

466
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:15,678
Realism's goal is to depict reality as it is.

467
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,359
In realistic literature a peasant, a servant, a lackey, a criminal

468
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,158
cannot speak by using Church-Slavonic words

469
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,698
and use antique metaphors

470
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,539
just because this writing's style is supposed to be 'high'

471
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,218
and an author is speaking about some 'higher matters' in the text,

472
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,999
for example, if the author desribes a conflict between landlord's feelings and duties.

473
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,939
Therefore every poetic device is good as long as it helps to depict reality better.

474
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,419
An root of a word didn't matter to Pushkin,

475
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,178
was it borrowed from foreign languages,

476
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,658
from church books, from dialects,

477
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,119
from argot of Petersburg's nobility.

478
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,579
He broke a strict connection 'colloquial -- low style',

479
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,919
'Chuch-Slavonic -- high style',

480
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,859
and used any word if needed.

481
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,359
He relied partially on his own language sense,

482
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,979
partially on previous literature's stylistic norms.

483
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,639
Therefore Pushkin didn't think that a literary work mustn't be split in styles.

484
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,119
Because almost in every case a long narration would include

485
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,239
something serious, 'high' and funny, 'low'.

486
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,299
And the most of the text would be neutral.

487
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,019
Pushkin avoided using two distinctly dissonating words together

488
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,039
E.g. "очи (arch.) разуй (colloquial)" (open your eyes),

489
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,039
"ея чресла (arch) лапать (derogatory)" (to touch her loins) or "девка теребила (coll.) перстами златыe власы (arch.)" (a girl played with her golden hair with her fingers).

490
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,219
It creates a humorous effect.

491
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,419
There are exceptions like, 'I squeezed my eyes shut, for, you see,  // I could not bear it any longer, // And broke away....', but it's a rare thing.

492
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,659
However, separating large pieces of a text into smaller ones is easy.

493
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,639
Pushkin's works are easily separated into small texts,

494
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,019
and each of them has its own stylistic unity.

495
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,919
A good example of Pushkin's poetry where the poem is separated into three equal pieces:

496
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,279
A solemn Church-Slavonic beginning,

497
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,579
Karamzin-style French midst

498
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,094
and folk-colloquial ending.

499
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,844
(this is my literal translation)

500
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:08,919
This sandy and deserted land // Is sacred for a poet's soul, // Derzhavin praised it very high, // With Russian glory is it full.

501
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,399
Up to this time the Naso's shadow // Is haunting Dunay's greatest shore // It is allured by heav'nly singing // Of Muses' children [poets] and Apollo.

502
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:24,319
With it I often under moon // Wander around the riverbank, // But, dear fellow, I would rather // Enfold you as my living Ovid

503
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,139
Is the Russian language applicable for every purpose?

504
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,739
In 1825 Pushkin wrote,

505
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,979
'Science, politics and philosophy have never spoken Russian;

506
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,619
there's no such thing as metaphysical vocabulary in Russian.

507
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:45,979
Our prose is so undeveloped that in a regular correspondence we are forced to invent new idioms

508
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:53,319
to explain most usual things; so our idleness prefers to speak foreign languages, where all the phrases and words are developed and known'.

509
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,479
The main trait of a developed language is that you can describe everything in it

510
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,419
You can write articles on science or politics in it,

511
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,059
with its tongue you can create an atmosphere of older times and express the national spirit,

512
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,579
you can write an amorous poem in it,

513
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,179
you can curse harshly in it, you can tell a tale to a child in it

514
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,699
or discuss yesterday's party with friends.

515
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,439
It is obvious that if some nationality had never had a need to discuss some topics,

516
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,999
then it won't be able to do it impromptu.

517
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,199
Creating a scientific, political, philosophical vocabulary takes a lot of work and time.

518
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,659
Usually this process takes place in later historical period and is quite clear.

519
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,899
For example, it is known that Russian philosophical vocabulary

520
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,699
was based on German and was developed in the beginning-middle 19th cen.

521
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,199
During Pushkin's time lots of words were absent,

522
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,319
so no wonder he and his contemporaries often had to speak in French.

523
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,019
They just didn't know how to explain it in Russian.

524
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,079
This situation is well-known to anyone who knows a foreign language well

525
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,459
and have read about some subject in this foreign language.

526
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,839
And when you're trying to discuss it in Russian with your friend

527
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,999
you are confused about the word usage because there are only foreign categories in your head.

528
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,679
Of course, Pushkin was convinced that Russian language should be used

529
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,899
in all literary genres and in every field of life.

530
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,579
Maybe one of the answers to a question, 'Why is Pushkin considered to be the greatest Russian writer', is

531
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,899
Pushkin left his marks everywhere:

532
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,019
poetry of all genres,

533
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,659
poems, tales, novels, narrations, dramas, memoirs, diaries, opinion journalism,

534
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,319
critiques, works about history:

535
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,759
his correspondence is published. And for all this he is famous.

536
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:33,259
Summing up

537
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,039
Approximately up to 23-25 years old Pushkin was experimenting with styles and genres.

538
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,659
As a hard-working bee he took notice of different authors' advantages

539
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,899
and rejected everything he disliked.

540
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,359
Pushkin wrote well, better than many others, but actually he wasn't outstanding.

541
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,419
Howeever, when he became older, he cerated nothing more than his own recognizable style.

542
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,079
Every great writer has it.

543
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,719
And it's nothing like the creation,

544
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,679
the reformation, the thansformation of the Russian literary language.

545
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,259
These phrases about Pushkin are nothing but praising mumble.

546
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,479
Pushkin developed his own opinion on slavisms, dialectisms,

547
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,079
on using various literary devices.

548
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,159
But Pushkin didn't write a book where he'd sum up his opinion on the evolution of the Russian language.

549
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,719
He only made some common statements,

550
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,979
sometimes contradictory, in various articles, personal letters,

551
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,739
replies to critics or critique of other authors' works.

552
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,679
Because of Pushkin's texts some words have changed their meaning or stylistic category,

553
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,199
but Pushkin didn't reform the stylistics, too.

554
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,179
He was rather just fighting with stereotypes,

555
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,919
because there hadn't actually been any 'system of three styles' before Pushkin.

556
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,719
He was only very well-read and had good sense of language,

557
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,119
that's the secret of his tongue.

558
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,299
Pushkin stood on the shoulders of titans:

559
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,919
Karamzin, Fonvizin, Radishchev and many others, who used to write as original as Pushkin in their times,

560
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,879
but who weren't crowned with laurels and called 'the creators of the modern Russian literary language'.

561
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,939
Pushkin just wrote a lot, he tackled every genre,

562
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,599
and his style is actually pleasing.

563
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,919
In my opinion, the most important thing is that Pushkin became a legend while being alive.

564
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,239
He was a real superstar of his time.

565
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,999
He was born to a famous noble family,

566
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,259
he was the first Russian author who managed to gain money for his writings,

567
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,559
an emperor's сonfidant, a friend of many other famous writers,

568
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,139
he was loved by journalists: lots of amorous liaisons, duels, scandals, exiles.

569
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,819
Sometime he told something good about Russian nation,

570
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,859
something bad about serfdom,

571
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,559
that was the reason bolsheviks adored him, and, of course, a tragic death in a duel.

572
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,199
Perished, so to say, because of the woman he loved, died so young...

573
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:53,159
These things created the cult of an author.

574
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,639
(Bulat Okudzava's song "А всё-таки жаль...") (my literal translation) 'One cannot turn time widdershins and mustn't mourn over the past,

575
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,239
Every epoch has its own sprouting branch.

576
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:12,219
But it's still a pity that Alexander Sergeich and I can't just

577
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:18,819
drop in the 'Yar' and have there a fast lunch'.

578
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:25,839
But it's still a pity that Alexander Sergeich and I can't just

579
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,819
drop in the 'Yar' and have there a fast lunch'.

580
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,820
the end
