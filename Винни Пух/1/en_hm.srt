1
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,222
Once upon a time, a very long time ago now,
about last Friday,

2
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,889
a bear cub lived in a land
under the name of Winnie-Pooh.

3
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,375
And why 'under the name'?

4
00:00:53,242 --> 00:00:55,844
Because there was a sign over his door that said:
'WINNIE POOH'.


5
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:58,358
And he lived under it.

6
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,329
Once Winnie-Pooh went out to the forest,
to have a little snack.

7
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,851
He would never mind having a snack!


8
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:10,010
Besides, he was a poet and composed verses
and even ditties (little songs) in his leisure time...

9
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,818
They went like this:


10
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:16,755
Winnie: Pam-param-the back... of my head
Poom-pooh-room-taram... the shouties

11
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,345
Poom-poohpoompoom...

12
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:24,024
If I scratch the back of my head, it's okay!

13
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:26,929
There is only sawdust in it, yeah, yeah, yey!


14
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:29,425
But although there's only sawdust,
All these shouties & those screamies...

15
00:01:29,684 --> 00:01:31,850
And also the noisies,
pantloudies and sighpuffies...

16
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,846
I compose them rather nicely on some days! Yes!


17
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,443
Winnie-Pooh lives quite a good life in this land,

18
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,041
That is why he sings these ditties all aloud!

19
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,814
What he’s doing doesn’t matter,
If he doesn’t grow much thinner,

20
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:49,360
And I know that he won't get there...
If he doesn't skip the dinner... Yes.


21
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,411
Tram-param-pam-pam-parapam-pam
Pam-pam-pah!

22
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:54,899
Poom-pooroom-poohpoohpoohroom-poom
Tram-pam-pah!

23
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,100
Poom-poom-poom-pooroopoom-poompoom...


24
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:01,210
Poompooroom-poompoom...

25
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:12,199
[There came a loud buzzing-noise]
It HAZZ to BEE for a reason!


26
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,839
A tree cannot buzz by itself,

27
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,720
So this means somebody is making a buzzing-noise,

28
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:22,022
And the only reason for making a buzzing noise
is because you're a bee,


29
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:26,875
I guess...
And the only reason for being a bee...


30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,030
Is to make honey, ...


31
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:35,581
I think...
And the only reason for making honey is...


32
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:38,311
So as I can eat it!


33
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:39,809
I believe so!


34
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,715
It's a very funny thought that
If Bears were Bees,


35
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,721
They'd build their nests


36
00:02:55,503 --> 00:03:03,667
At the bottom of trees.
Oh!
Isn't it funny? Bang!
How a bear likes honey? Bang!


37
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:09,525
Buzz-buzz-buzz! Bang!
I wonder why he does?
Mama!


38
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:21,976
So Winnie-Pooh went round
to his friend Piglet,

39
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:25,399
Who lived in a little house with a
"TRESPASSERS W" sign.

40
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:30,135
And even Piglet himself didn't know
who "TRESPASSERS W" had been.


41
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,035
- Good morning, Winnie-Pooh!

42
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,531
- Good morning, Piglet.

43
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:45,045
I wonder if you've got such a thing
as a balloon about you?


44
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:47,327
- A balloon?


45
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:49,849
Yes. I just thought to myself coming along:

46
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,900
'I wonder if Piglet has such a thing
as a balloon about him?'


47
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,948
- What do you want a balloon for?

48
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:10,717
... honey...
- What?
Honey.
- But you don't get honey with balloons!


49
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,940
- I do.


50
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,439
Well, it just happened that Piglet
had been to Rabbit's house a day before,

51
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,198
and got two perfect balloons there -
blue one and  green one


52
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,934


53
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:23,424
- Which one would you like?

54
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:32,284
When you go after honey with a balloon,
the great thing is not to let
the bees know you're coming.

55
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:36,433
- Aha.
- Now, if you have a green balloon,
they might think it is only a little leaf,
and not notice it.


56
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:40,262
- Aha.


57
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,882
- And if you have a blue balloon,
they might think it is only part of the sky,

58
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,462
and not notice it either.

59
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:50,050
- Wouldn't they notice YOU
underneath the balloon?


60
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,958
- They might or they might not.


61
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:57,532
Oh, I shall try to look like
a small black cloud.


62
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,418
That will deceive them.


63
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:03,762
- Aha! Then you had better have
the blue balloon.

64
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,461
The place where we are going
Is 'secret big and great!


65
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:20,254
That we're not telling anyone
Oh no, oh no... And...


66
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:23,231
- Yeah!
- Have you an umbrella in your house?


67
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:29,416
- Umbrella?
- You know, we should bring an
umbrella with us, just in case.


68
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,709
You can expect anything from these bees.
- Aha!

69
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,612
The place where we are going
Is 'secret big and great!


70
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:45,045
That we're not telling anyone
Oh no, oh no... And...


71
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:47,840
- Yeah!
Hold it.

72
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:58,785
That's it. Now I'm just like
a real black small cloud.

73
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,0002
The place where we are going
Is 'secret big and great!


74
00:06:02,0002 --> 00:06:05,186
That we're not telling anyone
Oh no, oh no... And...


75
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,698
- Yeah?
- No.

76
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,913
- Inflate the balloon!
- Aha.


77
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:37,131
- Aha.
- Let go.
Hooray!
- Isn't that fine?


78
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:40,514
- So, what do I look like?


79
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:43,814
- You look like a Bear
holding on to a balloon.


80
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,046
- And not like a small
black cloud in a blue sky?


81
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:48,985
- Not very much!


82
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,166
- Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different.

83
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:57,830
- And, as I say, you never can tell with bees!
Buzzzzzzz!!!!


84
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,622
- Piglet!
- What?

85
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,752
- I think the bees suspect something!

86
00:07:09,0009 --> 00:07:10,581
- What sort of thing?


87
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:14,766
- I don't know. But something
tells me that they're Suspicious!


88
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:22,549
- Perhaps they think
that you're after their honey?

89
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:30,657
- Piglet! It seems they don't believe
I'm a small black cloud.

90
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,640
- What do we do?

91
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,783
- Put the umbrella up and walk up and down.


92
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:37,985
I shall do what I can by singing
a Little Cloud Song,


93
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,811
And you look at me and say:
'Tut-tut, it looks like rain...'


94
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,045
- Aha.
Tut-tut, it looks like rain...

95
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,150
- Tut-tut, it looks like rain.
Tut-tut, it looks like rain...

96
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:53,571
I'm 'rainy little Cloud
And not at all a Bear.


97
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:57,307
How sweet to be a Cloud
Floating (phew) anywhere!


98
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,741
- Ow, Piglet!
- Tut-tut, it looks like r... What?

99
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:02,979
- I have been thinking, and I've
come to a very important decision!


100
00:08:03,0003 --> 00:08:07,0007
It turned out
THESE ARE THE WRONG SORT OF BEES.
Quite the wrong sort.

101
00:08:07,0007 --> 00:08:09,251
So I should think they would make
the wrong sort of honey.


102
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,842
I... So I think I shall come down.


103
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,906
- Tut-tut, it looks like r...
But how?


104
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:16,734
- I hadn't thought about this...

105
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:18,785
- Tut-tut, it looks like rain...

106
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:20,618
- Piglet!
- What?

107
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:24,634
- Have you got a gun at home?
- I have.

108
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,965
- Bring it quickly!
- Aha.

109
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:37,174
It makes him very proud
To be a little cloud (phew!)
Every little (phew!) cloud
Always sings aloud...  OWW, Piglet!


110
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,769
- I'm here!
- Fire!


111
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,534
What are you shooting at?

112
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:47,358
- At the bees, of course.

113
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,050
- Not at the bees!
You must shoot the balloon down!

114
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:55,972
- But... If I do that...
it will spoil the balloon...

115
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,363
- But if you don't shoot,
that would spoil me!

116
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:00,534
- Aha.


117
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:04,0004
- Ow-ow-ow! Ooh!

118
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,896
- Did I miss?


119
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,990
- Ow.. You didn't exactly MISS.
But you missed the BALLOON.

120
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:13,320
- I am so sorry.


121
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:39,805
Winnie!
Winnie!
Winnie!


122
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:43,871
- Ooh...  Phooh... Pooh... Pooh...

123
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:50,857
Perhaps this is why,
although we cannot say for sure,

124
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:54,054
he was called "Winnie-Pooh".

125
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:06,582
- Isn't it time for a little snack?
I think it is!

126
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,815
And so this is the end of the story,
But of that one only.


127
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:19,412
There are others:
About Pooh and Rabbit,
About Piglet and the old grey donkey.

128
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,483
And everyone else!
