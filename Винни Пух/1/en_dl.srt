00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,222
Once upon a time... a very long time ago now,
about last Friday,

2
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,889
there lived a little bear under the name of Winnie the Pooh.

3
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,375
And why 'under the name'?

4
00:00:53,242 --> 00:00:55,844
Because it said "Winnie the Pooh" above his door,

5
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:58,358
and he lived under it.

6
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,329
One day Winnie the Pooh went into the woods to get some food.

7
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,851
He always didn't mind getting something to eat.

8
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:10,010
He was also a poet, and in his spare time, he wrote poems...

9
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,818
...and even songs. Something like this:

10
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:16,755
Tram-param-purum... in the back of his head pum-pum-pum-param.... shrieks

11
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,345
Poom-poom...  Poom-poom-poom.... 

12
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:24,024
If I'm scratching in the back of my head - no problem!

13
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:26,929
There's sawdust in my head - yes, yes, yes!

14
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:29,425
But though there's sawdust in there, there's shouting and yelling...

15
00:01:29,684 --> 00:01:31,850
And also noisemakers, marshmallows, snot-noses...

16
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,846
I compose quite well sometimes - yes! (ding, ding)

17
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,443
Winnie the Pooh lives well!

18
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,041
That's why he sings those songs out loud!

19
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,814
It doesn't matter what he does if he doesn't lose weight

20
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:49,360
...and he won't lose weight... ...as long as he gets his food in time... YES! (gurgle!)

21
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,411
Trump-pump-pump-pump-pump-pump-pump-pump-pump!

22
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:54,899
Trum-purum-pum-pum, pum-pur-pum-pum Pum-pum-pum!

23
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,100
Pum-pum-pum-pum-pum..... Poom-poom-poom-poom.... 

24
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:01,210
Poom-poom-poom-poom... pum-pum

25
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:12,199
zzz-zz-zzzzzz
This zzzzz is for a reason.

26
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,839
The tree itself can't buzz.

27
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,720
So someone's buzzing around here.

28
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:22,022
Why would you buzz if you're not a bee?

29
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:26,875
I think so. What are bees for in the world?

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,030
To make honey.

31
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:35,581
I think so. What's honey for?

32
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:38,311
For me to eat it.

33
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:39,809
I think so.

34
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,715
If bears were bees,

35
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,721
they wouldn't thought...

36
00:02:55,503 --> 00:03:03,667
would never thought of building a house so high.  OH! The bear loves honey. (boom) Ow!

37
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:09,525
Why - who will understand? In fact, why does he like honey so much? Oh, ma...!

38
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:21,976
So Winnie the Pooh went to his best friend Piglet, 

39
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:25,399
who lived in a house marked "Trespasser B."

40
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:30,135
And who was the Trespasser V. - even Piglet didn't know about it.

41
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,035
- Good morning, Winnie the Pooh!

42
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,531
- Good morning, Piglet.

43
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:45,045
I wonder if you have a balloon?

44
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:47,327
- A balloon?

45
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:49,849
Yes. I was just passing by and I thought: 

46
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,900
"I wondered if Piglet had a balloon."

47
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,948
 - What do you need a balloon for?

48
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:10,717
HONEY - What? Honey. - Who is it that goes to get honey with balloons?

49
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,940
- I do.

50
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,439
And just the day before Piglet visited Rabbit,

51
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,198
and they gave him two beautiful balloons - 

52
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,934
a blue one and a green one.

53
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:23,424
- Which one do you like better?

54
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:32,284
Here's what. When you go to get honey, the main thing is not to let the bees see you.

55
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:36,433
- Yeah. - If it's green, they might think 

56
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:40,262
it's a leaf and they won't notice it. - Uh-huh.

57
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,882
- And if the balloon is blue, they'll think it's just a piece of sky, 

58
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,462
and they won't notice it either.

59
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:50,050
- Do you think they won't notice you under the balloon?

60
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,958
- Maybe they will, maybe they won't.

61
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:57,532
Oh, I'll pretend I'm a little cloud.

62
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,418
Then they won't know.

63
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:03,762
- Yeah. Then you'd better take the blue balloon.

64
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,461
Where are we going with Piglet?

65
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:20,254
A big, big secret! And we won't tell about it, oh, no and no...  И!

66
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:23,231
- Yes! Do you have an umbrella?

67
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:29,416
- An umbrella? - See, I was just wondering if we should bring an umbrella just in case.

68
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,709
You can expect anything from these bees. - Aha!

69
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,612
Where Piglet and I are going is a big, big secret!

70
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:45,045
And we won't tell about it - oh, no and no... И!

71
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:47,840
- Yes. Hold this.

72
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:58,785
Here we go. Now I'm just like a real black cloud.

73
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,0002
Where Piglet and I are going is a big, big secret!

74
00:06:02,0002 --> 00:06:05,186
And we won't tell it oh, no and no... И!

75
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,698
 - Yes? No.

76
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,913
Inflate the balloon. - Yeah.

77
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:37,131
- Yep. Let it go. Yay! Isn't that great?

78
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:40,514
So, what do I look like now?

79
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:43,814
- Like a bear flying in a balloon.

80
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,046
Don't I look like a little cloud?

81
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:48,985
No, you don't!

82
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,166
- All right. Maybe I look more like one from here.

83
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:57,830
Does one know what those bees will think? B-J-J-J-J-J-!!!!

84
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,622
- Piglet! - What?

85
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,752
- I think the bees suspect something.

86
00:07:09,0009 --> 00:07:10,581
- Suspect what?

87
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:14,766
- I don't know, but they're acting suspicious.

88
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:22,549
- Maybe they think you're trying to steal their honey.

89
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:30,657
Piglet! They don't seem to believe I'm a black cloud.

90
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,640
- What should I do?

91
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,783
Open your umbrella and walk back and forth.

92
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:37,985
I'll sing the cloud song, and you look at me and say:

93
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,811
"I think it's going to rain..."

94
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,045
 - Yeah.  I think it's going to rain...

95
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,150
Looks like it's going to rain. I think it's going to rain.

96
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:53,571
I'm a cloud, a cloud, a cloud, I'm not a bear at all.

97
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:57,307
Oh, how pleasant for a cloud in the sky (phew!) to fly!

98
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,741
Oh, Piglet! - I think it's going to rain... What?

99
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:02,979
I thought, I thought, I figured it out!

100
00:08:03,0003 --> 00:08:07,0007
Turns out they're the wrong bees. They're not right at all.

101
00:08:07,0007 --> 00:08:09,251
And they must be making the wrong honey.

102
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,842
I... I'm going down.

103
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,906
I think it's going to rain...  How?

104
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:16,734
- I haven't thought about that yet...

105
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:18,785
- I think it's going to rain...

106
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:20,618
- Piglet! - What?

107
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:24,634
- Do you have a gun at home? - Yes, I do.

108
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,965
- Bring it quickly! - Yeah.

109
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:37,174
And in the blue-blue sky there's order and comfort... (Phew!) That's why all the clouds sing so cheerfully... Ouch, Piglet!

110
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,769
- I'm here! Shoot!

111
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,534
What are you shooting at?

112
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:47,358
The bees, of course.

113
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,050
Not the bees!  You have to shoot down the balloon.

114
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:55,972
But... If I shoot, the balloon... it'll be ruined...

115
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,363
And if you don't shoot it, then I'm ruined!

116
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:00,534
Yeah.

117
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:04,0004
Uh-oh! Ooh!

118
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,896
Did I miss?

119
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,990
Uh... Not that you did miss. You just didn't hit the balloon.

120
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm so sorry.

121
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:39,805
Winnie! Winnie! Winnie!

122
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:43,871
Uh...  Pooh... Phew...

123
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:50,857
Maybe that's why, although you can't say for sure,

124
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:54,054
he was named Winnie the Pooh.

125
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:06,582
Isn't it about time we had something to eat? I think it's time!

126
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,815
Well, that's the end of the story. That is, the end of this story.

127
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:19,412
And there are others: about Pooh and Rabbit, Piglet and the old grey donkey.

128
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,483
And about all the others :)
