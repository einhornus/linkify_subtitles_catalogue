124

He says it will be expensive.

125

-Okay, take the tour. -Okay, the tour is ideal for us.

130
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
-Wonderful. -Does the tour tour everywhere?

131
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
- So where are you traveling? -The plain or something?

132
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,791
Do you tour the plain?

133
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,583
Plains, natural beauties, historical beauties,

134
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,708
You will visit all of them one by one. They were traveling everywhere.

135
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,375
There will already be special vehicles in front of your door,

136
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,875
they will take you and show you all over the place, uncle.

137
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,458
You pick us up with special vehicles.

138
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,208
-Perfect. Accomodation? -How is the accommodation?

139
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,375
You will stay in four-star hotels, uncle.

140
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,250
-It's four stars. -Four?

141
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,958
I was expecting five, my expectation was for five, but it would be four.

142
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,125
Sure. Okay. Accept, accept, take the tour.

143
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,250
Ok nephew.

144
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,916
Only uncle, these places are not like our places. Look, it's very hot.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,291
Be careful, take clothes with you accordingly.

146
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,666
It would be very hot there.

147
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,041
No? I thought it was cool too. The heart of Central Anatolia!

148
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,500
It takes the sun like a mirror, of course it's hot.

149
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,333
This is the Konya Plain, death valley!

150
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,583
Either your brother Recep knows the place already, he knows it's hot.

151
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,125
Is there anything else?

152
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,541
You have e passports, don't forget the passports.

153
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,500
Bring them to me and I'll deliver them back to you on the plane.

154
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,500
It says passport?

155
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,750
Where does the passport come from? Do we show a passport when we go to Konya?

156
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,125
-Not for safety? -Hee, maybe.

157
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,958
There is a state of emergency, a state of emergency. It could be because of passports, it makes sense.

158
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,041
I already have Salih Abi, you can buy it from him.

159
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,500
Ok nephew, I'm bringing all the paperwork to you.

160
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,875
E super uncle, we got a deal.

161
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,166
-Okay? - He said okay.

162
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,625
If it's ok, close it, close it directly, close it without giving up.

163
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,125
Cayar, mayar now. Shut it down now, shut it in your face.

164
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:55,041
I'm so excited huh! We're going to a great festival, hit it!

165
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,208
[makes a kissing sound]

166
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,458
Slow on the side...

00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,375
Take good care of the Red Devil, got it, jack bro?

169
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,291
Don't leave the car alone. Let's.

170
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,708
Selamunaleykum my nephew. Here are the documents.

171
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,750
-Goodbye, uncle. -Selamun aleykum brother.

172
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,583
Aleykum salam. Hello uncle.

173
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,791
I just told you to wear clothes suitable for that place.

174
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,500
Is there anything better than this bro? These are my great-grandfather's clothes.

175
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,958
We wore them because they were wearing them in that region.

176
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,000
Ok brother, if you say that, I will not be rude.

177
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,291
I mean, people hang around there anyway.

178
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,958
The important thing is to breathe the same air.

179
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:42,583
hey. It is important to live that mysticism, that theology, that spirituality.

180
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,541
That's right, my brother.

181
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,208
Now we have to catch the plane, the convoy.

182
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,166
- Let's get our vaccine, let's go from there. -Is it a vaccine?

183
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,375
Where does the vaccine come from? No, wait a minute!

184
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:56,625
-The vaccine has not been tried. There is no vaccine. Where did it come out of? -My brother, it is compulsory by the state.

185
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,750
It has nothing to do with me.

186
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,416
Yahu bro, are we primary school babies?

187
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,625
Should the state make vaccination compulsory for us?

188
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,000
Then the state should also look for mumps and chicken pox.

189
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,375
Let's celebrate Domestic Goods Week. What is this?

190
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,666
Either we will go on a trip for three days, the state did not come after us.

191
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,916
What about my nephew, is there anything you can do?

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,250
Unfortunately, my uncle.

193
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:18,791
What if it were up to me, would I bother you here, for God's sake?

194
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,375
I say, God forbid, in case something happens to you there,

195
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:26,416
I mean, not because it will happen, but because we said it happened, you understand?

196
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,083
Not like this, Nurullah. Can you excuse me for a second?

197
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,750
OK. We have five minutes, we'll catch the plane. OK?

198
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,666
Let me tell you something very clear Nurullah, I did not catch my eye on this baby.

199
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,333
There's definitely something wrong with this baby. -What is it, Recep?

200
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,750
Ya, I'm also getting hairy because he's your relative anyway.

201
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,833
Your whole family is smugglers, swindlers. This is her own father at the wedding,

202
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,541
Didn't he take his mother's gold and run away with the wedding officer?

203
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,500
Okay, I say give this kid another chance,

204
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,708
Let's not convict him for his father, but...

205
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,750
"Look, passport," he said, bristling.

206
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,958
We come here, he says vaccine. There's two.

207
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,458
God forbid the third.

208
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,916
What if the government says something, it's true.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,708
If the subject is the homeland, the rest is details!

210
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,500
We know too! Don't stop shouting slogans here!

211
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,208
We know it too! I call you a vaccine, a vaccine!

212
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,333
Walk! Walk!

213
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,833
[inaudible conversations]

214
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,541
Selamunaleyküm, my teacher.

215
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,041
-How can we do it, sir? Shall we go like this? -Here you go.

216
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,166
Sir, let this friend be the first.

217
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,958
-You first! -You are the first, my son.

218
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,250
-I'm scared! -I'm scared too, son!

219
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,000
-Be you, does it hurt? -You're big, sit here.

220
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,000
-Come on, come on! Get over there, son. -Oh, Recep!

221
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,208
Oh, please sit here.

222
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,291
So you're both going to get it done, after all. If you want, go first.

223
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,583
God damn you! Take it.

224
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,583
Hold this too.

225
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,041
Which arm should I roll up, sir? Should I graze my right arm or my left arm?

226
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,958
-We don't do it from the arm alone. -How can you not do it by arm alone?

227
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,208
-We don't do it by hand. -Where are you from, ma'am?

228
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,125
From the hips.

229
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,791
-How from the hip? -From the hip. Rough meat.

230
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:00,333
When I say rump, I mean... Ass, we know.

231
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,916
[cakes] So...

232
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,875
We were never told such a thing.

233
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,166
We are victimized over and over again, but not at this airport.

234
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,458
Is it this way?

235
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,666
-What vaccine is this, sir? -Malaria.

236
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,250
We are going to Konya, my teacher.

237
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,708
What is malaria doing in Konya, Central Anatolia Region?

238
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,500
Konya? Beautiful!

239
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,041
Look at the triples! All these doctors are getting head burns,

240
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,791
they work for seven or eight years.

241
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,750
They cut a cadaver, a corpse, a kidney splashes in your eye or something.

242
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,708
Peel it off please.

243
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:32,875
my mother! My mother, my teacher! You're getting to the point very quickly, sir! Not that way, but that's it!

244
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,583
Can you look at what you have, sir? Do you peel it?

245
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,791
You haven't specified your preference yet. Right or left, sir?

246
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,291
-It does not matter. -How does it matter, sir?

247
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,375
Just like the arm, there are two separate parts there.

248
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,000
Should I scrape the right lobe or the left lobe? Which one should I scrape?

249
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,833
So it doesn't matter to me.

250
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,208
[sighs] Sir, then let me shoot from the right,

251
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,333
they usually hit me from the right when I was a kid. My mother, Nurullah!

252
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,041
-Sir, is this stripping enough? -Enough is enough.

253
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,666
Ah! It hurts it hurts!

254
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,000
-Sir, I haven't even touched it yet! - All right, sir.

255
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,625
-Ah! It hurts it hurts! -The needle is in my hand!

256
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:06,000
Please let me know before I do, I want to prepare myself.

257
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,875
Alright. Take a deep breath!

258
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,000
God! I'm on fire, God!

259
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,916
-What number are we at, Nurullah? -Eight, bro.

260
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,208
-Eight? -Yup.

261
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,083
The girl who threw us back again.

262
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,166
-Nurullah? -Yes bro?

263
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,416
Are you sure we're on the right plane? -Yes, brother, the people of our tour.

264
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,916
We passed together. Hello aunt.

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,666
What aunt? Have some manners!

266
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,000
You will say sister, sister! Shame, shame!

267
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,708
Excuse me ma'am, what did this boy say to you?

268
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,666
Did he say old man? Did he say kartoloz, what did he say? Aunt said!

269
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,958
Do not exaggerate so much, let me love your eyes! You are already your aunt.

270
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,541
-It would be an insult to say sister, you're an aunt. -Ill mannered!

271
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,000
Late Nurullah, walk. Give it, give it.

272
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,250
Give me the bag too.

273
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,208
Have a nice flight.

274
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,833
[sighs]

275
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,291
Do you feel any difference when you look at the plane in general?

276
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,750
-No. -How do you not feel?

277
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,208
-There are too many blacks. -That's right bro.

278
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,000
-Why is that? -I do not know.

279
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,291
Activate the flower pot.

280
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,625
-I couldn't find it. -This is the power of Konya, the power of Konya.

281
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,958
What did Mevlana say?

282
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,416
"Get out and come." said. -Oh, god damn you! Ignorant!

283
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,583
O Seda Sayan lan, Seda Sayan o!

284
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,541
Mevlana said, "Whatever you are, come." said.

285
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,333
Look how, flock from the world,

286
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,416
The whole world is flocking to Konya. How does it migrate?

287
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,083
[hostess] Please fasten your seat belts.

288
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,250
Oh, notice.

289
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,625
Please open your sunshade and put your belongings in the pocket.

290
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,875
Did you fasten your belt? Is it plugged in?

291
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,875
-Did you wear your belt? -Yes.

292
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,750
-Where in Konya are you from? -Yes.

293
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,875
-He? -Yes.

294
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,291
You say yes to every shit, I don't get it.

295
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,916
Come on, bismillah, give your hand Konya.

296
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,666
Have a nice trip, captain, lift the plane.

297
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,875
-[the plane shakes] -My mother!

298
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,500
Allahu Akbar! What's going on Nurullah?

299
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,791
Nothing bro, calm down. We got into turbulence.

300
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,541
Look, look, look, look at the comfort of this.

301
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,833
"Nothing bro, calm down, turbulent..."

302
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:22,250
It's as if he flies 45-50 thousand miles every year, giving me turbulence lessons.

303
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,958
What time is it?

304
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,583
-13.37 bro. -How 13.37?

305
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,041
-So it's been three and a half hours? - That's right, brother.

306
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,666
How about Nurullah?

307
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,625
-This work is being weird. -How is it, brother?

308
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,750
-How many hours is it from Istanbul-Ankara? -One hour.

309
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,958
er? Below Ankara is Konya. One and a half hours from Istanbul-Konya.

310
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,666
It's half past three, there's definitely a problem here, Nurullah.

311
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,916
-Brother, no air traffic? That's right, air traffic.

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,916
It gets very tight just after work,

313
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,166
There is a bridge, the Istanbul-Konya bridge, right? You idiot!

314
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,916
What traffic in the air? Null. You are flowing.

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,583
What traffic? The traffic happens on landing and taking off.

316
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,250
I have to ask this, Nurullah, it is not a good sign.

317
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,791
It shouldn't be three and a half hours.

318
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,750
[beeps]

319
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,916
Hostess? Hostess? Do you believe?

320
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,291
Come on girl. Come on. I pressed it.

321
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,083
You you. You come.

322
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,166
Where did this come from?

323
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,583
Here you go, sir.

324
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,875
Did I call you bro?

325
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,000
No, my friend is interested in the service. Let me help you, please.

326
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,916
I pressed the button here,

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,291
We came face to face with the lady from there, she is coming, you came from behind.

328
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,875
You're going to make a haircut. Is this your district? You just delivered sandwiches.

329
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,166
-What are you doing here? -I did not understand but...

330
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,875
Anyway... Look, we just checked our watch, we were stunned.

331
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,250
This plane has been in the air for three and a half hours, and it doesn't seem like it will land any further.

332
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:48,291
Yes sir, we only have three hours of flight, so we don't look like we're about to land.

333
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,500
Hey bro, how can there be three more hours of flight?

334
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,583
-How many hours is Istanbul-Konya? -Istanbul-Konya...

335
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,875
So I'm not entirely sure, but...

336
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,333
-Probably about... -Oho! We have business with you!

337
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,291
What kind of host are you? The host will be friendly to the customer you call.

338
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,833
You became a post, not a host.

339
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,958
It's a place I fly, not a track, that's why.

340
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:12,083
What's wrong with me bro? Anyway... We've been in the air for three and a half hours.

341
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,125
You put in three, it's half past six.

342
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,791
Fall one and a half, five hours. Tell me the difference between these five hours bro.

343
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,958
Gentleman, the distance between Istanbul and Konya is one and a half hours. But this is not the Istanbul-Konya flight.

344
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,083
-What plane is this? -Kenyan sir.

345
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,125
-Is it Kenya? -Kenya.

346
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,625
Isn't that a Konya plane?

347
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,208
How is Konya? This is the Kenyan plane, sir. You must be kidding. [Laughs]

348
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,916
A minute! Is this plane going to Kenya right now?

349
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,166
-Yes, this plane is going to Kenya. -What does this Nurullah say?

350
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,875
We boarded as Konya. This plane has to go to Konya.

351
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,125
-Sir, this is Istanbul-Kenya. -You are kidding.

352
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,958
-No dear, why should I joke? Tell me it's a joke, son.

353
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,583
This is not a Kenyan plane!

354
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:51,541
-You tell me this is a joke! - Sir, will you leave?

355
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,125
-Can you quit? -Are you kidding me?

356
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,125
-I'll talk to the pilot! I'll talk to the pilot! -[groans]

357
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:02,000
- That pilot will tell me, he will! -Stop, sir!

358
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,541
I will go to Konya! To Konya! Not to Kenya, to Konya!

359
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:10,916
Leave us to Konya, just go to Kenya!

360
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I will go to Konya! To Konya!

361
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,375
-Get out, get out, I'll knock you out! -What's going on?

362
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,166
This man had to pass out! Why didn't he faint?

363
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,083
-[grumbles] -Is it not working?

364
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,916
[traditional African music]

365
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,250
[elephant voices are heard]

366
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,041
Look at this situation! We came to Kenya as Konya.

367
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,916
Does one letter change that much?

368
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,083
Does the environment change that much when you put "E" instead of "O"?

369
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,416
Brother, if you look less positive. Look, we came to Kenya, not Konya.

370
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,750
We are on vacation. Let's savor it.

371
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,416
Why should I think positive, son? I ate 7,000 volts at 30,000 feet.

372
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,208
I still can't feel the left cheek of my ass right now! Why should I be positive?

373
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,500
[camera click you]

374
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,500
Pull pull, pull like this! Take it like this!

375
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,875
-What's going on, Recep? -Hey, what's going on?

376
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:45,333
Look, if I miss that bean festival in Konya,

377
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,875
then I will ask you, then you will see what happens.

378
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,166
Welcome! Welcome sir, welcome!

379
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,791
You are all welcome. Welcome to our beautiful Kenya.

380
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,458
It's me, your tour guide Ersin.

381
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,166
How was our journey? Are we tired?

382
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,458
-No, brother, were you with us too? -I do not understand?

383
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,625
Were you with us too? "Are we tired? Have we?" Are we a group together?

384
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,583
No, I'm just talking about.

385
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,875
The plane shook a little, so sorry you're nervous.

386
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,625
I understand. Let me take you to your tents, rest.

387
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,166
Tent? Where does the tent come from, Nurullah?

388
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,625
No tents! It was a four-star accommodation?

389
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,750
-We were not called that, Ersin Bey. -But sir, that's our concept.

390
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,250
Look at this, look at me.

391
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,041
How can we stay with this in the tent?

392
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,083
Will it work in the same tent as this? What if tonight he snores, farts,

393
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,875
truck rolls over, does something.

394
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,333
-Are you very different, Recep? -Shut up!

395
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,583
Don't worry, our facility is already four star rated.

396
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,250
Trust me, you will love it. Here please.

397
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,916
What happened to us because of you? Walk, walk!

398
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,291
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

399
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,916
Well, how did you find it, sir?

400
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,083
What can I say, it's more beautiful than my house.

401
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:09,375
I told you. Have a good rest, tomorrow will be a tiring day.

402
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,333
-I'll see you at 6am for breakfast. -Is there breakfast at 6, bro?

403
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,958
What did our ancestors say? "An early riser gets an early start."

404
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,083
Have a nice day!

405
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,250
My eye is stinging from somewhere, but Nurullah... Hold on, for the best.

406
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,666
Which bed?

407
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,666
-Brother, let it be. -No?

408
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,833
I will sleep in it, you will sleep here. You will be close to the door.

409
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,458
You will face the danger first.

410
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,958
When the animal mayvan comes, it will attack you first. LAT!

411
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,333
[sighs and puffs]

412
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,291
Nurullah.

413
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,250
[horuldar]

414
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,250
Nurullah.

415
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,791
He brought us to the middle of Africa,

416
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,833
snoring like glass, you bastard dog!

417
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,708
It's so bad that I'm awkward about my place. [sighs]

418
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,125
It seems like everyone is watching me, I see eyes everywhere.

419
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,291
What is it?

420
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:12,208
my mother! It moves too. Ayy, that's a bug!

421
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,416
Aha! God damn it! He went and stuck to the bottom of it.

422
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,875
Oops! He is very afraid of this insect.

423
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,916
What are we going to do, an insect as much as a calf's eye.

424
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,791
[gags]

425
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,833
I swear I'm going to vomit now!

426
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,083
Alas, let me see...

427
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,625
[continues to snore]

428
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,458
Look where the animal is standing, damn it!

429
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,083
When we say let's kill the insect, we will castrate Nurullah.

430
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,583
But there is nothing to do, Nurullah, I have to hit the insect.

431
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,041
Come on, bismillah. [spits]

432
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,208
[sighs]

433
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:46,250
my mother! It moves, goes, goes! It came to his face, God dammit!

434
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,166
I swear I'm going to vomit!

435
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,833
[gags]

436
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:54,833
He had a hideous face, made even more disgusting by the bug. God damn it!

437
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,875
Let's see... One, two, three.

438
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,916
Oh!

439
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,916
my mother! It got in your mouth! Cough Nurullah! Nurullah, cough!

440
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,500
Cough, Nurullah! The man is dying! A man is dying in Kenya!

441
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,625
[Rep shouts]

442
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,791
Take it out Nurullah! Nurullah take it out!

443
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,541
[cries continue]

444
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,333
-The man is dying! The man is dying in Kenya! -Output!

445
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,333
-Is it out? Are you sure? -Output!

446
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,583
-Is it out? -It's out!

447
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,125
Ah! Jamboo-Jamboo! Jamboo-Jamboo! [kahkaha atar]

448
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:31,875
No no, no cambo mambo, no cambo. Bitch, bro.

449
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,791
my bro. Not Cambo, bro.

450
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,666
Ah! Bro-jamboo. [laughs]

451
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,833
Go away! Go go! I swear I'll hit the slipper in your mouth from here!

452
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,500
[laughs]

453
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,375
[elephant voices]

454
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,208
Good morning to you too, brother.

455
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,208
Both your brother and you... I'll fly you out of here with my head, huh!

456
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,666
-I think you got up backwards today. -No, I got up from my beautiful side!

457
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,833
I'm super happy!

458
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:11,416
I was going to go to Konya to eat dried beans, I eat this in Kenya. Very nice.

459
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,333
It was perfect!

460
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:16,291
Outside in the 55 degree heat of the savannah, all the wild animals staring at me,

461
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,583
I woke up perfectly this morning!

462
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,916
Do I want it like this, Recep? There was a mistake.

463
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,583
Shut up! Shut up! Don't be upset with the man!

464
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,708
-Did you call your nephew? -I called bro, I talked.

465
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,250
What is he saying? When is the return flight?

466
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,500
Unfortunately, three days later, there are no planes.

467
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,083
-I made a backup. -God damn you!

468
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,625
God bless you and your nephew!

469
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,583
You know, the midwife who gave birth to you, I'm screwed!

470
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,166
Two organisms like you were supposed to perish,

471
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,583
How did you come into the world?

472
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,291
-Why are you insulting? -Shut up! Speech!

473
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,375
Everyone who sees me since morning bursts into laughter.

474
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,291
They think you and me are lovers because of yesterday's incident.

475
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,916
Could such a thing happen? You disgraced us.

476
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,333
[they chat]

477
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,833
Jamboo-jamboo! [laughter]

478
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,500
All because of this bastard.

479
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,833
I got you boy, I'll catch you in the savannah...

480
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,041
I'll cut your head off!

481
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,916
Jamboo! [laughter]

482
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,208
Do you understand why I'm angry now?

483
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:13,125
Oh brother, you're angry, you're irritable, but your appetite is good.

484
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,083
It's not like our breakfasts, be careful! By Allah, you will feel nauseous.

485
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,916
Hey! You know a lot!

486
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,125
You lived in Africa for seven years as an expat,

487
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:24,833
You know very well African culture! You are so dominating! Look at what you eat.

488
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,625
God's idiot! They did it very well, it's like a gullac. will you buy it?

489
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,083
-Oh brother, is it edible? -I swear it's edible, it's perfect.

490
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,791
-I'm nauseous. -By God, eat it.

491
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:36,000
Well done! Are we serving sweets to each other?

492
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:40,041
Good morning sir. I hope we weren't too tired last night, huh?

493
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,625
Because we're going to watch the Great Migration soon. [chuckles]

494
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,166
Look, here's the thing I told you about.

495
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,833
-What's your name bro? -Ersin.

496
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:51,833
Ersin, you will take my beating. Look, be smart. What are you implying to us?

497
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,416
No, astaghfurullah sir. Cambo cambo... [laughs]

498
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,958
What boy cambo cambo? What are you trying to say son?

499
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:02,416
The watchman saw it for us, when the event came to life in my eyes... Ay got upset. [Laughs]

500
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,333
What did he see brother watchman? What are you trying to say?

501
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,416
You mean chorolo? What are you talking about?

502
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Any client can come to us. It's your personal preference after all, isn't it?

503
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,958
Oh, of course it's my choice.

504
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,125
And I will give you a choice, which will be your choice.

505
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,833
Should I say A or B, should I say C or should I say D? What can i say?

506
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,333
-Sorry? I say choose one.

507
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,791
Should I say A or B, should I say C or should I say D? Which one?

508
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,083
-Get it. -Good choice.

509
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,250
[inler]

510
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:32,041
If you had chosen B, C, there was no slap there, you chose A. This is your choice.

511
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:37,166
Brother, I swear, I will cut you in the savannah, Tarkan will perform the funeral prayer, do you understand?

512
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,958
-Get out of here! -Go go!

513
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,625
-Go go! Why are you provoking us? -Don't be idle either! Don't be empty!

514
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,833
All this happened to us because of you.

515
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,875
I swear I'll stab you! I swear my knives.

516
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:51,125
I hang it from your feet to the ceiling, I inflate it with a hose and I skin it.

517
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,291
No matter what we do, we can't help you, Recep!

518
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,916
We are ready to go too, huh, our safari is starting!

519
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,958
God... Are these left in our car?

520
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,208
It would have been better if we had gone before they arrived.

521
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,750
Captain, you start the car a little bit, maybe we can get away. Here you go.

522
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,750
Hello! Wait, where are you going? Ho!

523
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,333
Oh!

524
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,208
Oh! Oh!

525
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,291
Oh! [lip smacking]

526
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:30,666
Be heavy, slow down! No, that's right, brother, where are you trying to go as if you were running away?

527
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,666
Sir, we're a little late, so many people can't wait for you, in that sense...

528
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,708
No!

529
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,458
So many people will wait for me bro! It will wait!

530
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,458
Since you broke my order,

531
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,791
Since I'm in a place I don't want right now,

532
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,083
since I'm in Kenya by force,

533
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,916
-Then you will wait for me. -Yup.

534
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,833
What if I were in Istanbul, I would have my breakfast at 10 o'clock,

535
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,583
around 11 o'clock my bowel movement begins,

536
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:56,500
Excuse me at 12, I'll take a good shit. Here you have breakfast at 6,

537
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,875
my bowel movement has not started yet, my poop has not come.

538
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:03,083
I don't want to start the day like this! That's why you wait bro.

539
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,416
-Of course. -Open the door.

540
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,541
-You were so needed... -I don't understand?

541
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,666
Well done, I say you came, we are not deprived of you. [chuckles]

542
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:14,416
Brother! Know your guide, guide like a man, okay?

543
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,000
Don't bother me. Let me see you.

544
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:21,041
Selamun aleykum. Have a nice tour

545
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,291
I'll tell my master, I hope we see lots of animals.

546
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
WL.

547
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,916
[traditional African music]

548
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:58,833
This is the land where humanity was born, dear friends.

549
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,333
The habitat you see around us,

550
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,791
It is home to 500 kinds of animals.

551
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,791
-Take a look, please. - I remembered how I met the friend.

552
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,708
-Do you recognize? -Look, watch well.

553
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,625
-Guide, will you look? -Here you go.

554
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:14,250
You mean 500 kinds of animals, count!

555
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,583
[chuckles] I'll count if I have to, so what?

556
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:20,416
- Say it right now, it's necessary. I asked, say. -I'll count.

557
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,958
Rhino, elephant, gorilla, lion... Did I count the rhino?

558
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,666
What happened man? You know, there were 500 kinds of animals here?

559
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,666
What happened, why can't you count 496 of them? Stupid! [Laughs]

560
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,708
Do you remember me?

561
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,833
Sir, it's you again, all kinds of jokes, right?

562
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:43,250
Anyway, sir, in a moment everyone in this car is what we call the Great Migration ,

563
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,916
He will witness the Great Migration.

564
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,583
An announcement will come over the radio, and we will go to watch.

565
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:51,291
-Sir, what is the Great Migration? -There is only one immigration that I know,

566
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,375
the Turkish tribes who migrated from Central Asia to Anatolia.

567
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,416
[chuckles] What does that have to do with it, sir?

568
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,416
Are you taking it lightly? If it wasn't for immigration

569
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,416
you were selling water on the Great Wall right now, idiot!

570
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,166
Sir, this migration is an influx of herds to more wetlands.

571
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,291
Oh okay! Every morning in Istanbul

572
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,916
there is a migration to work in droves.

573
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,625
Sir, this is an animal migration.

574
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:16,458
Partly the struggle for survival, partly brutality! The journey of hope!

575
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,000
Ok, we're talking about the same thing.

576
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:22,500
People are already struggling to survive every morning.

577
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,250
People are biting each other's arms and legs for an empty seat.

578
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,333
What are you saying? Already inside the animal-filled public transport.

579
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:33,000
There is a pervert, there is a molester, there is a rapist, sir. He has a fort.

580
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,833
I mean, it was the last one who even fingered himself and made him vomit.

581
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:39,375
Do not interfere with the guide and let him tell! Will we listen to you dear?

582
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,833
Is it hard, sister? My tontik, are you having a hard time?

583
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:42,916
What's hard?

584
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,250
-I say menopause, is it hard? -Ill mannered!

585
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,416
Sir, please let's be calm. Let's be calm.

586
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Dear guests, take a look at this vast plain.

587
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,833
Everything, everything started here.

588
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,333
What happened, Recep?

589
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:01,000
I have a very bad pain in my stomach, Nurullah! I'm terrible!

590
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,291
I said don't eat those dishes, brother!

591
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,208
How do you know it's about food?

592
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,166
-[his stomach growls] -Are you okay?

593
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,375
I swear, guide, I'm not good at all, my poop is very bad. I have to jump.

594
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,750
-No, you can't get out of the car! -Should I shit in the car?

595
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,125
No sir, don't! Don't jump...

596
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:19,375
It's dangerous, we're in the field! It's full of wild animals, it's dangerous!

597
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,583
By Allah, it is more dangerous for me to stay in the car, let me tell you so.

598
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,291
I'm going to have such an explosion,

599
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:26,750
It will jump on everyone. I am in such a situation.

600
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,583
-Flow will flow, output will come out. -[his stomach growls]

601
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:32,375
I didn't know what to do. At least don't go away, go somewhere soon.

602
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,250
Let's get down! Go far!

603
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,791
Are you talking to gene? I swear I'm going to shit at your feet now huh!

604
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,291
I'll let go, I swear!

605
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,791
-Ill mannered! -Damn woman!

606
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,916
[his stomach growls] Mom! I'm going to that bush.

607
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,583
Don't go anywhere, I'll fuck that bush and come.

608
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,916
[woman grunts]

609
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,500
Hay Allah... [inler]

610
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,416
[distance elephant sounds]

611
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,625
[sighs and puffs]

612
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:58,791
[inler]

613
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,833
[distance elephant sounds]

614
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,250
-Does it take too long for your friend to work? -Takes. He likes to hang out long.

615
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,125
[walkie-talkie öter]

616
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:16,000
[speech voice from walkie-talkie]

617
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,750
-God! Migration has begun! -What did you say? Did you say emigration?

618
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,083
- Migration has begun! -Act immediately!

619
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,375
I've been waiting for this moment for a year.

620
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,625
I can't miss this migration for a shitty reason!

621
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:28,625
My husband is the most famous lawyer in Istanbul.

622
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:32,250
I will destroy your company! I'll take it from your feet to your panties!

623
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,750
We are disgraceful with our money! Refund our money! We are going to emigrate immediately!

624
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,333
Or where are we going? We can't go anywhere without the man coming.

625
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:41,291
my god! I was confused as to what to do. Migration has begun!

626
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,000
But if everyone says let's go, there is nothing you can do. You!

627
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,750
Get off at least and stay with your friend, but don't move.

628
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,791
Get into the bush, stand like this.

629
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,708
Let's watch the migration, we'll come back and get you. Okay?

630
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:53,541
I will not leave my friend anyway. I'm getting out of the car!

631
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,416
-Of! Get in quick! -Don't move, don't move.

632
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,875
We'll be right back, don't move.

633
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,375
Come on, hurry! Go! Go! Go!

634
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,291
-Recep! -Don't come, don't come!

635
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,250
I'm pooping!

636
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:08,916
OK, I'm waiting here.

637
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,375
Friend, there is no comfort even when taking a shit.

638
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,041
[Receiving]

639
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,708
-How have you been, Recep? -I'm fine, why did you come?

640
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,291
The vehicle had to go urgently,

641
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:22,250
I got out of the car so as not to leave you alone, I came, my brother.

642
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,833
-Did you get out of the car? -Yes brother.

643
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,708
-Where is the car? -Brother, the vehicles are gone.

644
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,500
The announcement came, the Great Migration has begun.

645
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,416
Man, why are you letting the car go?

646
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,416
Why are you letting the car go before we get in the car?

647
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,750
Brother women made a big deal!

648
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,833
Damn, I'm going to pass it on, I'm going to bring you the big event!

649
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:41,083
Are you stupid son? Are you retarded? Is your head not working?

650
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:44,041
Is it okay to get out of the car just because two or three wives made a scene?

651
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,791
This is Africa! Predators everywhere!

652
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,208
How do you get out of the car?

653
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:52,000
Brother, calm down. They're going to pick us up from here, don't go anywhere,

654
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:55,000
They said wait in the bushes. -You idiot!

655
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:58,541
I just fucked up here! Here's the smell of hot shit!

656
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:02,625
In Africa, the smell of hot shit spreads fast. It will spread all over now.

657
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:06,375
It was all jackal, jackal, cheetah, leopard, lion coming here!

658
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,416
-Should we wait here? -What are we going to do, brother?

659
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,708
Call that camp quick! Quickly call the camp, reach the camp, quick!

660
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,625
-Brother does not draw a line. -What the hell is pulling on you anyway?

661
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,250
-What attracts you? Brother, let's call with your phone.

662
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,750
No, I did not take my phone.

663
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:22,541
I left it at camp. I left it in the camp because it is closed abroad, data roaming is in progress.

664
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,291
I didn't get it, I don't have a phone with me.

665
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,416
-What are we going to do, brother? -[sighs] We have only one way, Nurullah.

666
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,416
We will find the camp by following the tire tracks left by the cars, there is no other way.

667
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,333
Of course, let's check the lions, for example, they went to the gazelle there.

668
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:37,833
There's a surplus of lions on that side, we'll go this way.

669
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,541
Brother, what if the lions come there too?

670
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:43,875
Here's what we're going to do, stand side by side, look at the lion and run in different directions.

671
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:47,416
The lion will be stunned, one of us will follow, the other will be saved.

672
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,625
If my brother comes to the place where I go, lion...

673
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,416
Hopefully! I hope they choose you.

674
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,875
If they come to you, run as far as you can.

675
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:58,000
Where you can't run, kneel, lie on your side, fold your hands, open your neck,

676
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,000
Say "Ashhadu en la ilahe illallah" and say salawat.

They're already doing the rest after that.

678

-The driveway is over. -Are we in the wrong direction, Recep?

690
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,208
No. We couldn't have come in the wrong direction.

691
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:05,208
All my calculations showed that the camp was here.

692
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,916
So it definitely has to be there. We've come this far.

693
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,541
Ah, the driveway. It ends here.

694
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,041
No! Cars came from the air, landed here, started here!

695

We're in the wrong direction, Recep!

696

Yes, based on all my experience, I'm telling you right now Nurullah,

712
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:07,750
If the direction we came from is cut off here, there are two options left.

713
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,291
We will either go left or right.

714

-I think we should go right. -Let's go, Recep.

Nurullah, let me tell you clearly and unequivocally that

720
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,166
We got lost clearly and precisely.

721
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,750
-Are we lost? -Hey, I swear we're lost.

722
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,750
I have no idea where the camp is.

723
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,291
So what are we going to do, Recep?

724
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,583
Surely we will do something, God!

725
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,833
We're not in the mood to sit here and cry like a girl!

726

I'm the alpha male, it's my job to survive!

727
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:13,333
When I was a kid they used to drop me off in the city seven or eight kilometers away,

728
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,666
From there I would find the village at night, sniffing, in the dark. Barefoot.

729
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,166
What are you talking about?

730
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,291
Now, the sun will set.

731
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,875
We need to find a formula to spend the night in the open.

732
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,000
Will we stay outside?

733
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,916
Yoo, I'll stay here, I got you a hostel. You idiot!

734
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,166
We are in the forest, we will stay outside!

735
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,833
But not in open space. We have to turn our backs towards the forest.

736
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,916
Therefore, we will go to places where the trees are denser.

737
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,833
Our back will be closed, our front will be open. Come on, let's walk like this.

738
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,333
OK, very nice.

739
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,833
It's perfect now, Nurullah.

740
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,333
No one can touch us here. The woods behind us

741
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:53,875
Our fire is burning in front of us. Our field of vision is free,

742
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,583
Our angle is clear, we dominate the enemy.

743
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,916
We can sleep soundly here now. -I hope, Recep.

744
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,958
I hope he doesn't have a salary. Predator does not come to the place where the fire burns.

745
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,500
The animal is afraid when it sees the fire. For example, did you see a fire, would you go?

746
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:10,250
-I won't go, Recep, this is an animal. -You are an animal too, Nurullah.

747
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,833
I mean, you're a kind of animal, too, so I can't say that you're human.

748
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:17,208
Are you closer to a human or an animal? Take a look at yourself, make a self-criticism.

I don't go to the fire, you don't go to the fire,

00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:16,416
Do you see these? Three gorillas just stand in the middle of the forest.

822
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,375
It's really incredible. I guess it must be some kind of mating ritual, don't you think?

823
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,750
-[groans] -[Recep shouts]

824
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:27,000
[groans and shouts]

825
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,166
Damn, knock it out!

826
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:29,458
-Wow! -Them

827
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,125
We need to knock him out and take him to the lab.

828
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,125
Absolutely I agree.

829
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,375
Stun it! I'm out of power!

830
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,666
Blow out the first one, please.

831
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,708
Why are you hitting me, idiot! You will hit this!

832
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:49,833
Wrong, Recep!

833
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,791
[gorilla grunts]

834
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:55,458
What happened to it?

835
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,666
Oh! It was a great shot!

836
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,500
What happened to this animal, son? Did this animal have a heart attack?

837
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:03,916
Oh?

838
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:08,166
Nurullah, they hit him with a needle.

839
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:12,666
There must be people here. They shot it with an arrow, with a poison arrow.

840
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,750
Next, knock out the second one.

841
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:16,708
-[gunfire] -[groans]

842
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,458
my mother! God! Nurullah! [groans]

843
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,166
I was shot in the ass! my mother! They shot me too, Nurullah!

844
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:26,750
God! They shot me in the ass, it comes to my leg. Look, the leg is wasted!

845
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,750
Uh! Look at this! Falling, falling!

846
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:34,708
My leg is free! Look how my leg is bouncing!

847
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:37,500
Nurullah! Nurullah! I saw it in a documentary,

848
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,625
Take out the needle, suck my ass, take the poison!

849
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,333
-Take the poison Nurullah! -Your ass?

850
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:42,541
Hey, my ass! Suck my ass!

851
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,041
-I can't suck, Recep! -Suck my ass, suck!

852
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,958
-I can't suck, Recep! -Suck my ass Nurullah!

853
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:48,208
Suck my ass before the poison spreads!

854
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:49,666
-[silah session] -God!

855
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,541
-What happened? -I've been shot, Recep.

856
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:52,625
Forgive me...

857
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:56,791
Did you get shot too? Damn everybody got shot, god damn it!

858
00:44:56,875 --> 00:45:00,708
I'm left all alone here! my mother! Well, my mother...

859
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:03,375
[groans] It's starting to affect me too...

860
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,583
I was paralyzed on my left side. [groans]

861
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:09,750
I still have one eye playing...

862
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,041
It still hasn't worked on me... And my eye...

863
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,458
[inler]

864
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,541
-Hey! -Really...

865
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,250
-High five. -Oh my God!

866
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,875
-That's it! -That was incredible.

867
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,166
[inler]

868
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,916
Let's get them and take them to the lab.

869
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,291
-Let's go. -Lets go.

870
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,625
[nonsense]

871
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:34,166
-I swear I'm just sobering up huh. -Where are we, Recep?

872
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,875
I don't know him either, Nurullah.

873
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,458
They brought this with us. I guess we are in a place like a laboratory.

874
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,500
[gorilla grunts]

875
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:45,375
-Did you pee under it? -I pissed, Recep.

876
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:48,041
Look, you're the big guy. Does it suit you?

877
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,291
-I can't feel my feet. -Aha, they came. Teacher?

878
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:54,375
Sir, can you see? You're doing it wrong, a lot.

879
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:58,083
Get us out of here. Why are we being treated like gorillas, are we gorillas?

880
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,625
We are human! Human human!

881
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:04,750
Human! Man, man. Man, man like man.

882
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,333
Man, man like man.

883
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:10,416
The most interesting species I've ever seen. Especially the two on the right are very unusual.

884
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,041
Are we one with it?

885
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:14,041
Homo sapiens sapiens.

886
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:17,416
A wise man, a wise man, a wise man.

887
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,666
A wise man

888
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,083
I think let's start the tests now.

889
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,666
Get us out of here, quick.

890
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,500
-Me and my friend, please. -Test one, please start.

891
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:26,375
What happened? He said start, start start.

892
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:32,458
What is this complicated thing? How do we do this?

893
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:33,875
Take the purple, give the orange.

894
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,666
Like.

895
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,041
[joy sound]

896
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:46,291
You don't show a way! How did the animal end?

897
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:48,375
Test two, please start.

898
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,208
What are we going to do here, sir? What is this teacher?

899
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,083
Aha, I have the numbers gone. I don't remember where it is.

900
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,250
It's not going to happen!

901
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,125
[sighs]

902
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:03,750
[ring tone]

903
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,291
God damn it! It was something like that, sir.

904
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:09,333
Oh my god, that one is a complete idiot!

905
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,500
[beeping sound]

906
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:11,875
[groan of joy]

907
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,833
-Is it finished again? - Pretty smart.

908
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:16,041
-Yeah, he's really smart. -That's not all!

909
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:17,833
It came out very easily.

910
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:20,458
It is torpedoed as an animal. What's wrong with this?

911
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,500
[groan of joy]

912
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:24,375
-I'm going to hit you on the head, huh! -Test number three, start please.

913
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,000
What is this, teacher? What are we going to do about it?

914
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,375
[sighs] I'm out of hand! My hand!

915
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,333
[sighs and puffs]

916
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:43,708
Look. Look, it detected sugar, my teacher, it detected sugar.

917
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,208
[gorilla grunts]

918
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,875
Oh my God!

919
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,500
That's it. You're dealing with a stick.

920
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,208
Stupid, stupid, smart.

921
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:00,166
[spits]

922
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:09,625
[Recept lip smacking]

923
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:13,083
Look what happened to us! Look what's happened to us.

924
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:17,958
Aha.

925
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:20,875
Nurullah.

926
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,291
-Yes bro. I thought of a terrific escape plan.

927
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:29,166
-Are we going to dig a tunnel, brother? -Hee, we're going to dig a tunnel. Is the spoon with you?

928
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,375
Like El Chapo... Idiot! What a tunnel!

929
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:36,375
We will get out of here with a collective effort.

930
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,000
-The ones on the wall are the keys to the cages? -Yes brother.

931
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,583
-Are you sure? -Yup.

932
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,833
-There's the doormat over there. -Yes brother.

933
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:48,125
-Let him come to you. -Brother, is it the time to joke?

934
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:49,083
[chuckles]

935
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,125
All right. Can you reach him?

936
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,750
-I'll try bro. -Try it.

937
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:54,666
Try it, try it.

938
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,500
Is it taken?

939
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:00,291
-Did you lie down? -He's reaching out, brother.

940
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:05,375
-Are you getting? Slow down, be quiet. -I got it bro.

941
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,375
Do not make noise.

942
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:09,708
-[Recep] Did you get it? -I bought.

943
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,875
Watch.

944
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:17,416
OK. We have completed the first phase.

945
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,708
Now the second stage, we will work with the gorilla.

946
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,416
-[gorilla grunts] -[Recep whispers and lip smacking]

947
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,541
Look here. Come on, be quiet. Take the stick.

948
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:31,708
Take the stick, take the stick. Take the stick. Now turn the stick. Turn the stick.

949
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:35,083
Look there, look there. There is the key, the key.

950
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:37,833
It's their lock. It's the lock, the lock.

951
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:42,083
They locked you in there, that's his lock. If you get the key...

952
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,666
We will run away, we will go together. Key.

953
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,291
What was the key ? The key is hanging on the wall! Look there! Pass the stick.

954
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:53,250
Bring the stick, put it on it, get it.

955
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,375
It's kakdir.

956
00:49:56,416 --> 00:50:00,833
Don't worry! Bring the stick. Take the key, reach for the key.

957
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:04,458
God damn you! You knew how to hit the damn lights.

958
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:08,458
You knew how to choose a picture, Eşşoğlueşşek. Learn to use tools, to use tools.

959
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,250
You idiot, you just can't get out.

960
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,250
You splattered, you splattered the whole escape.

961
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,833
No, it's not possible. He doesn't understand this is a fucking idiot.

962
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:19,916
[sighs]

963
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,083
-I guess he's doing it. -[groans]

964
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,416
[whispers] He does! Come on son! Come on son!

965
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,208
Pass the stick! Well done!

966
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:28,500
Well done! Come on son, get it out of there.

967
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:29,958
Al! Al!

968
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:35,000
Take it son! Take it son! Take it son! Get! Well done son!

969
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,833
Well done to you, well done. Well done to you, give me the key.

970
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,833
Give me the key. Give.

971
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:44,708
You are Adam. I swear you are a man, well done for you, you are a man!

972
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:49,916
We took it, I swear we survived. Let's open that lock before that idiot wakes up.

973
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:52,958
[sighs]

974
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,541
What are you doing? Give me the keys!

975
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:01,333
-Go away! -Give me the keys! Give...

976
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:08,416
I swear he hit the man's cerebellum, knocked him out! Well done son, bravo.

977
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,458
[gorilla grunts]

978
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:19,208
Go this way, go that way.

979
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:24,625
-Come, come quick! Come on! Come man! -[groans]

980
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,208
Are you going there? Wow...

981
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:31,708
-So it's time to part, huh, Charlie? -How do you know his name, Recep?

982
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:34,041
- Usually their name is Charlie. -Charli?

983
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:37,291
Hey, Charlie. Come on, Charlie, go on your way.

984
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:39,500
Maybe you have two babies waiting for you too.

985
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:42,000
Maybe they're watching your way.

986
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:46,958
Don't make them need a dry branch or a dry eucalyptus. Run, come on go.

987
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,041
Maybe your aunt is waiting for you too.

988
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:51,875
He made a nice sautéed banana for you in case you're coming tonight.

989
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:55,750
You go, wash your feet, eat your food. Here you go.

990
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:59,541
You are poor too, brother. We are poor too. We'll understand it.

991
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:03,208
Come on, go on your way, goodbye to you. Get on your way.

992
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,875
How is he moving, dummy! We are talking to you emotionally here.

993
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:12,541
What kind of move is that? If it moves, we have it too.

994
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,666
-Here's your move! Stupid. -[groans]

995
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,541
I didn't say you can't be a gorilla, I said you can't be a man! Get out!

996
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:21,083
Coward, get out! Go go! Stupid gorilla, go!

997
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,875
From here.

998
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,750
-I'm very thirsty, Nurullah. -I'm thirsty too, Recep!

999
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:49,041
Should we drink each other's urine?

1000
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,833
-Is it drinkable? -He's been drinking, son.

1001
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:53,000
It replaces water, I watched it in the documentary.

1002
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:55,916
By urinating, the man survived. Maybe it will benefit us too.

1003
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,500
Oh!

1004
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,791
Nurullah, do you see what I see?

1005
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,791
-[Nurullah] I see it, Recep! -Is it a village?

1006
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:06,500
-Yup! There is a village there, Recep. -Is it our village, Nurullah?

1007
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,458
-We survived! Nurullah we are saved! -We're saved, Recep!

1008
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:13,041
Mom, we survived! Thank God we saved my book Nurullah!

1009
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,916
There is water, look, Recep, I am very thirsty!

1010
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,125
I'm thirsty too, let's drink water first.

1011
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:19,916
Selamunaleykum sisters, let's have a drink of water.

1012
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,041
[women scream]

1013
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:27,000
What did we say, did we say something? Never mind. Come, come brother, come.

1014
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,625
Come brother come, come, come.

1015
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,000
[man shouts]

1016
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:33,958
[sighs]

1017
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:40,708
[groans] Here you go, take it... Take it, let it touch the dead.

1018
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,416
Recep! Someone is coming.

1019
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,875
[sighs]

1020
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:55,708
Selamun aleykum brother.

1021
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:59,375
What if we got lost but we have to find it, city by city.

1022
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,666
We need to talk, phone, city, plane.

1023
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,041
We will go, we will go to our hometown.

1024
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,125
He doesn't understand this.

1025
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,833
If we had come to one normal, Turkish village

1026
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,583
They gave us the buttermilk and buttermilk. What is this?

1027
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,750
I'm going to die for Anatolia! Look at these!

1028
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:20,666
They're all different from each other.

1029
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:25,750
Ya brother, we are with this, tourist tourist, photo photo, tourist.

1030
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:29,125
Safari, photo, tourist. You understand?

1031
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:31,583
We got out of the car, I was going to shit, I got out of the car,

1032
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:33,500
gone, when the car left, we stayed in the middle.

1033
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:37,583
[shouts angrily]

1034
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:38,708
[they shout together]

1035
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:40,958
What's going on!

1036
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:43,416
[screams]

1037
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,750
my mother! Nurullah! They're going to cut us crunchy!

1038
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,208
God help! They will kill us, Recep!

1039
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:53,083
Nor will they kill Nurullah, nor will they kill!

1040
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:57,291
Look at that move. damn! The Turkish government will not leave this to you.

1041
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,833
You're making a mistake, let us go, look, we are good people, son, let me love your eyes.

1042
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:03,125
Shut up Recep hush! You're pissing him off even more!

1043
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:04,750
It is not clear what it does!

1044
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,708
-Look at these situations! -[shrill screams]

1045
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,708
Without God, without books, these are Recep!

1046
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,333
Look, they're worshiping this.

1047
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:13,083
Oh! Nurullah!

1048
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,500
That man looks like me!

1049
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,291
-Yes, he looks like you, Recep! -I wonder if this is someone important?

1050
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:21,708
-May be important since it's on the top. -I thought of a plan, Nurullah.

1051
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,000
I'll take a chance.

1052
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:26,083
He held it, he did not hold it hakuna matata.

1053
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:27,708
What does Hakuna matata mean, Recep?

1054
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,875
Hakuna matata, meaning Nurullah!

1055
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:33,500
[screams]

1056
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,375
That's enough!

1057
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:39,583
Look over there! Look, look, look over there. what's in there?

1058
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:42,791
Hey, look at me now. Look at me, look at him.

1059
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:47,250
Behind.

1060
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:53,375
See, it's the same me. It's mine.

1061
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,458
Street?

1062
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:58,833
-Ha? What does Sokaçu mean? -I think his name is Recep.

1063
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,541
Hey, if his name is Sokaçu, look.

1064
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:02,958
I'll do better if you untie my hand, untie my hand.

1065
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,416
Untie my hand. Sokaçu Sokaçu. Untie my hand.

1066
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,083
-[speaks native language] -He topyanabu. Open Open open.

1067
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,000
Now look. Ah! Did you see?

1068
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,583
Ah! [nonsense]

1069
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,708
Do you see? It's me, Sokaçu!

1070
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:19,750
-Street? -[curious murmurs]

1071
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,583
[Recep] Sokaçu, I am Sokaçu.

1072
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:24,166
I am Sokaçu, I am Sokaçu.

1073
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:29,541
-[curious murmurs] -Street, me, same me.

1074
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,125
Alley!

1075
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:37,291
They believed, Recep, we are saved!

1076
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,458
I hope Nurullah. No, get up. Estagfurullah, get up.

1077
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:44,375
Lie! This is not Street!

1078
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:45,958
[excited hum]

1079
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:48,250
How is it not? I'm Sokaçu, I proved it!

1080
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:52,291
-[nonsense] Look at the same job, I'm Sokaçu. -No! No!

1081
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:57,708
-According to legend, Sokaçu has an animal! -[curious hum]

1082
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:00,125
OK, I have a pet too. Ah, you animal.

1083
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,666
Chief, this is my special animal. humanoid body, animal body

1084
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,250
It's a creature, it's my animal.

1085
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,833
-It's a shame, Recep! -Shut up!

1086
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:09,791
Any shame left? We will die here. You're an animal!

1087
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:13,000
It's a trust relationship like that, but I mean... I've proven I'm Sokaçu, look.

1088
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,375
You're lying!

1089
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:23,666
Street wonders! If you Sokaçu, prove it.

1090
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,750
All right, I'll prove it. I have proof to you, what is it?

1091
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:30,083
Tomorrow, until the sun goes down!

1092
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:34,625
Otherwise, you will die! [screams]

1093
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:37,083
-[excited hum] -What's going on? damn!

1094
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,750
Take my animal too, my animal!

1095
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,750
[excited hum]

1096
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:46,791
damn! Slow down, slow! It's like you're treating an animal.

1097
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:53,333
Look at this situation, Nurullah. They threw us into the hardware and garbage dump here.

1098
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:56,791
Anyway, thank God we're alive. I swear they were going to cut us!

1099
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,208
If you don't find a miracle by tomorrow, they'll cut it anyway.

1100
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:00,916
Shut up! Shut up!

1101
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:04,625
Don't be upset with the man! Get something to eat so let's eat, quick.

1102
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,875
-There is no bag, Recep. -Where is your bag?

1103
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,666
-E stayed where they knocked out. -Why don't you own it?

1104
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,750
-How do I take care of myself when I'm unconscious? -My God!

1105
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:15,083
Thank God I have a mobile phone and a charger with me.

1106
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:18,333
Well, plug it in and charge it. Is there electricity here, idiot?

1107
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:21,583
There is no network anyway, and your phone is turned off. Well done taking them.

1108
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:24,708
Do you remember? When we were in middle school, we were generating electricity from potatoes.

1109
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:27,625
Son, I didn't go to middle school. I'm a 3rd primary school dropout.

1110
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:30,333
I learned to read and write, I left education. Enough.

1111
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:34,583
I said enough there. The only thing I know about potatoes is the potato press.

1112
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:36,125
I was working with the counterfeiter,

1113
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,833
forgery of documents, that's all. I don't know any other.

1114
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,500
Go look over there.

1115
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,833
A place like Ardiye. There are definitely chickpeas, chickpeas, legumes, something.

1116
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:47,083
-We can even gnaw dried lentils, look. -Let me see, Recep.

1117
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:49,458
Come on, bismillah. [sighs]

1118
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:54,958
-Rep, come on. -What happened?

1119
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,791
-I found food, food! -Don't make a sound!

1120
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:58,083
-Come! -Don't make a sound, don't shout.

1121
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:00,500
[pigeons crow]

1122
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,208
-What is it, son? -Look.

1123
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:05,625
-What are these? -Did we turn two of them into one in the fire...

1124
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,791
Son, are you an idiot? Are these edible?

1125
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,375
This is the messenger pigeon, my son.

1126
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:12,208
Get one of these now and come immediately.

1127
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,625
Did you understand? Come on in.

1128
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:24,000
Come. Now, this bird will save our life, Nurullah.

1129
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,250
And you say let's cut it and eat it, will it be cut?

1130
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:29,166
We will tie the note to its foot, we will release it.

1131
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,250
Thanks to this, they will find our place.

1132
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,291
Hopefully, Rex.

1133
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:35,166
They will find it, how are we going to write a note about it?

1134
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,875
If only we had a pen and paper like this.

1135
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,750
Paper pen? I have it, Recep.

1136
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:41,708
Wow, live a thousand lives with your mind! Let's take it out.

1137
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:42,625
-Give me the bird. -Keep.

1138
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,666
Okay girl calm down, okay, nothing, girl.

1139
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,875
Oh, thank you, don't be afraid, my bird.

1140
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:53,250
Write. I got lost with coffee maker Nurullah and my friend Recep İvedik.

1141
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:54,708
-We are lost. -Stop.

1142
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,916
We're in Africa, stop. around Kenya.

1143
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,875
- Around Kenya. -Find us, stop.

1144
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,208
-Stop. -Help.

1145
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:04,041
-Help. -OK.

1146
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,958
Roll it up, fold it up nicely. Roll it.

1147
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:10,916
Now tie it well, let me see, tie it up.

1148
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,208
-Is it OK? - It's okay, brother.

1149
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,166
OK...

1150
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:17,208
This bird will go, convey our message and they will find us, Nurullah.

1151
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:20,583
-Brother, how will he find the address? -Hee, I swear you said it well.

1152
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:24,541
They find their way through scent. We need the smell of those places.

1153
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:25,625
What are we going to do bro?

1154
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:28,166
We need to show something that belongs to Güngören, Nurullah.

1155
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,000
-I have an idea. -What?

1156
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:33,625
-What hangs the most in our neighborhood? -I do not know.

1157
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:35,500
What is your lady hanging outside?

1158
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:38,458
-He is chasing so that the birds don't get on him. -Washing.

1159
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:41,833
He hangs laundry, but hangs your underwear.

1160
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:43,875
Everywhere is your underwear, in the neighborhood!

1161
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:46,625
There's frost on it too, did we give it a sniff,

1162
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:49,166
I swear he finds your underwear like a fly that clings to shit.

1163
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,083
-Take off your underwear quickly. -Does the frost come out?

1164
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,666
-Go take off your underwear! -Impossible!

1165
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,916
It's a matter of life and death. Go take off your underwear over there!

1166
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,583
Bring your underwear. I'm not too keen on your filthy pants!

1167
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:03,708
Stickers around. God forbid, what kind of body is this?

1168
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:09,250
Late, late, late, quick. Give me your underwear.

1169
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,958
Give me your underwear... God damn you, look at that underwear! Look at that donut!

1170
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,083
Smell it girl, smell it girl, smell it.

1171
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,958
That's where you'll find the center of it.

1172
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,500
You will go to Güngören, you will give our message. smell it.

1173
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:23,041
Kokla, kokla, kokla.

1174
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,291
Take your panties, take them!

1175
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:29,125
Come on, beautifully set us free, deliver our message.

1176
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:32,625
I'm throwing you, taking shelter in the Creator, come on, bismillah!

1177
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:41,208
Bravo, so the animal died because of your shitty underpants.

1178
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:44,583
The animal's lungs were cauterized, the animal could not bear the smell.

1179
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,375
Is there anyone?

1180
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,125
Uh? Someone came.

1181
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,291
Is there anyone?

1182
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,916
Selamun aleykum.

1183
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,041
Alaik-Salam, brother.

1184
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,625
No, you gave it until tomorrow. Why did you come?

1185
01:01:57,708 --> 01:02:01,291
Brother, I brought you food. Eat, eat.

1186
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:02,500
Thanks.

1187
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:04,416
One can also bring a drink.

1188
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,333
Our mouths and tongues stuck together. Take this, Nurullah.

1189
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:08,833
Thank God, we were hungry.

1190
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,750
I believe you, you are Sokaçu.

1191
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,625
-But prove it to my father, do a miracle. -What do you mean your father?

1192
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:16,958
The chief is my father.

1193
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:18,625
-Are you the chief's son? -Yup.

1194
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,583
If you're the chief's son, talk to your father and let us go.

1195
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:22,541
We are good people.

1196
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:25,541
Let you go, but show a miracle.

1197
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,875
Come on talk, let us go! Come on, I ate your life.

1198
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,750
I swear I'm a victim of the necklace, come on.

1199
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,166
Come on attack us. Talk to your father.

1200
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,125
-Can I tell you something? -Let me check.

1201
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,041
You eat, just eat. Let's.

1202
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,833
God damn you!

1203
01:02:41,416 --> 01:02:44,250
He ate... Don't we know? Stupid!

1204
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:48,625
Rich baby! That's the rich baby. There is money, there is everything, there is no head.

1205
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,458
Recep! What are you doing? Why are you making noise, brother?

1206
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,000
-What do you say jackass? Stupid. -What is this, brother?

1207
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:03,833
To charge that useless cell phone in your pocket,

1208
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,083
I made a charger.

1209
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:07,250
I also made an electric coil on the back.

1210
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:10,500
There is mechanics, there is mathematics here.

1211
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,666
Give me the phone.

1212
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,958
Sit here, sit down quickly. Quick!

1213
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:22,333
Wait for news from me, don't press anywhere! Don't mess with it, got it? It's a mechanical tool.

1214
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:23,875
Mm.

1215
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:25,500
OK, turn it over now.

1216
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:29,500
Turn it, turn the coil. Damn son, turn it stronger!

1217
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:32,500
-I can translate that much! -Turn it over, quick.

1218
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,708
Didn't move, let go, let go. Leave!

1219
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:37,666
-Take this, hold the phone. -[they]

1220
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,666
Let's do that too. Let's do the translation.

1221
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,958
Let us invent it, let us do the translation.

1222
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,750
-Are you going to kill me? -Speech!

1223
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:46,750
Speech!

1224
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:50,041
-I can't, bro. -Cut, cut!

1225
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,000
-Look at me. -Sir, my brother.

1226
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,958
- Let me know as soon as the electricity comes. -Okay, brother.

1227
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,166
-I will adjust the voltage accordingly. -OK.

1228
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,375
-Did you understand? -Understood.

1229
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,333
-Don't make me pedal for no reason. -OK.

1230
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:02,625
Let's see, bismillah.

1231
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,083
Come on, strength to your waist, Recep. I'm starting Nurullah.

1232
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,750
-Start, brother. -Here you go.

1233
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,750
[Nurullah] Translate, translate bro! Translate translate!

1234
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,833
Did he come? Did the electricity come?

1235
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:12,875
He didn't come!

1236
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:14,041
How is it not coming?

1237
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,708
-Go on, Recep, go on! -No electricity, son?

1238
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,916
Came now! Now bro started charging!

1239
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,500
-I'm increasing the voltage, I'm Nurullah! -Go on, brother!

1240
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:24,750
-I did the tempo, I swear my spleen is out! -Slightly faster! Tempo!

1241
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,583
-Tempo, Recep! -Is the phone turned on?

1242
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:28,833
It will open bro, it will open! Keep going, keep going!

1243
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:31,000
What a phone that won't turn on, what brand is it?

1244
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,375
Bro opened, opened, opened!

1245
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,708
- Now send a message to the first place you come across. -[phone rings]

1246
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:37,833
-Brother, the embassy message came. -Send Nurullah, position the embassy immediately!

1247
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,958
-I'm sending, I'm sending location! - Position the embassy immediately, Nurullah!

1248
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,250
I'm posting, man!

1249
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:45,291
Something happened to the phone bro, I think he's confused!

1250
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:48,500
-God damn you! What happened? -He's doing something on his own.

1251
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:51,333
-Oops! The camera is on, too! -What's the deal with the camera?

1252
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:53,958
-Something happened to the phone! -Why did you open it? Stupid!

1253
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:55,666
-I don't understand, he's confused! -Did you send it?

1254
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,625
-I'm taking pictures, brother, I don't understand! -Send it now!

1255
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,166
-Send! -Oops!

1256
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,208
Brother is going but I don't know what's going on bro!

1257
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:04,666
-Screen locked! -Send it!

1258
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,166
-Send this! -Oops!

1259
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,416
Alas, I can't hold the phone! God!

1260
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,083
-What are you doing? -My hand burned bro, the phone got very hot!

1261
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:14,125
Let me get you to work, you idiot!

1262
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,791
I did not like you at all, Ersin Bey.

1263
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:22,708
How can you leave Turkish citizens alone in the forest?

1264
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:24,375
It was as I intended.

1265
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:27,250
Sir, this bag related to missing friends was found.

1266
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:30,250
Most likely, this bag is theirs, and these items are theirs, sir.

1267
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:31,625
Yes, their bag.

1268
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:34,208
This bag was always on this short man's back.

1269
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:36,708
They camped near the western natural border of the savannah.

1270
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,375
- They found it there in the morning. - Any chance they're still alive?

1271
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:41,041
Yes, I hope so!

1272
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,625
Most likely friends with wildlife knowledge.

1273
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,875
-Mm. -[door clicks]

1274
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,875
Dear Ambassador.

1275
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,291
-There are encouraging developments. -What?

1276
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:54,000
There were messages on the embassy line last night. Signals, close to Uganda

1277
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,833
taken in a wooded part, west of Kenya.

1278
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:00,166
We think that these signals belong to our disappeared citizens.

1279
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,875
Our friends are working to locate the place.

1280
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,875
He is alive.

1281
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:25,416
Let go!

1282
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:33,916
Joyful! Perform a miracle or you will die!

1283
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:35,250
Bah!

1284
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:39,625
[Recep] Oh my God! What is this nerve?

1285
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,708
Didn't I say I'll show you a miracle?

1286
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:46,041
I'll show. Why did you gather so many people here? Let it be the miracle you want.

1287
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,500
What will you do now, Recep?

1288
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:51,375
There was a trick or two I learned in primary school, Nurullah. I will make them.

1289
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:54,958
They do not know whether they live in the forest or not. I think they're going to drop.

1290
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,750
If you're ready then let me begin.

1291
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:03,083
Look now, you see my fingers. Well watch now. Oh look.

1292
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,250
[slaps tongue]

1293
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:11,625
-Did you see? How miraculous? -[screams angrily] It's not a miracle!

1294
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:14,708
Look, my hand is in my pocket. Look, this is in my pocket.

1295
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,083
-Did you see? -What's this?

1296
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:24,750
Here, let me do something else. Look are you watching?

1297
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,416
[rhythmic sexual grunts]

1298
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,416
[faster grunts]

1299
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,875
[screams angrily]

1300
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:32,875
Show miracle!

1301
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:36,791
I will disappear from behind the cover you see in a moment.

1302
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:40,041
How will it be? It's a miracle. God's work, miracle. Now look.

1303
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,166
A.

1304
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:43,625
İki.

1305
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,625
Three!

1306
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:48,083
[inler]

1307
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:51,708
[groans and grunts]

1308
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:55,208
[everyone laughs]

1309
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:56,375
[screams angrily]

1310
01:07:56,458 --> 01:08:01,500
I have not met our friend before. Do I know you? I do not know.

1311
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:05,583
He doesn't know anyway, he doesn't know our language. Look now, watch well. Miracle!

1312
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:16,666
Ah egg! Where did this egg come from? How did the egg come out of his head?

1313
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,333
[screams angrily]

1314
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:20,125
Like a shit too!

1315
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,791
Look, get ready for a miracle now. Remove, remove.

1316
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:24,916
Are you watching well? Now look.

1317
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,875
[screams angrily]

1318
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,208
[crowd grunts]

1319
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,666
[irritable speeches]

1320
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,666
Niye bırakıyorsunuz lan? Ben size bırakın dedim mi?

1321
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:41,000
Ağzına sıçtıklarım! Bırakın dedim mi?

1322
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,250
Hazır mısın? Bak.

1323
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,291
[kızgınca bağırır]

1324
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,416
Ne var ya? Olmadı mı? Ne oluyor ya?

1325
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:57,083
Mucize yoksa, öleceksiniz!

1326
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,958
Ya şefim, gözünün yağını yiyeyim ya. Biraz insaf et ya.

1327
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,916
Sana ben beş on tane mucize gösterdim burada ya!

1328
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,750
Hiçbirini kabul etmiyorsunuz ama! Olmaz ki bu şekilde.

1329
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:10,500
Ayrıca da, sen bana dün ne dedin? Sen bana, "Yarın güneş batana kadar." dedin.

1330
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:13,750
Güneş batmadı ki şu anda. Battı mı güneş? Havada güneş.

1331
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:18,375
Laf ağızdan bir kere çıkar. Siz nasıl delikanlısınız oğlum?

1332
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:19,916
Sözünün arkasında duracaksın.

1333
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,416
Benim hâlâ mucize göstermeye şansım var.

1334
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,291
Doğru mu, değil mi? Öyle "öleceksin" e bağlama hemen ya!

1335
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,041
-Bir bekleyin ya! -Ne yapacaksın Recep?

1336
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:31,375
Aklıma bir şey geldi, şu iki büklüm adamı görüyor musun?

1337
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,375
-Evet, Recep. -Onu bizim Mehmet Abi'nin

1338
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,833
I'll fix it with technique. At least I will try.

1339
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:39,666
Chief! I'm going to show you a miracle now, okay?

1340
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,750
I just need a friend. I'll take this.

1341
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:44,375
Come here. Come here, come.

1342
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:47,958
Look, this friend is bent like this, like this,

1343
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:51,250
I'm going to do it upright like this, okay?

1344
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:53,083
What is its mission? This must be the magician.

1345
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:56,666
Did I make this wizard upright, do you accept the miracle?

1346
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:00,916
-No! Not allow! -Cut it, cut it!

1347
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:04,625
Don't jump all the crap! Don't give them such a say, my chief.

1348
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:07,958
Have your authority, do you accept or not?

1349
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:11,125
Did I have this sewn up, do you consider it a miracle?

1350
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:14,041
OK. Last chance.

1351
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:19,500
Yes, chief. We are here now for the miracle that will prove to you that I am a scavenger.

1352
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:23,416
Our friend, as you can see, is the magician of the years.

1353
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,958
-Are you okay? Ha? Look how she's fading. -[they]

1354
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:31,041
She's fading like glass right now, she's in pain, she's in pain. I will take them all now.

1355
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:34,375
Lie here, lie down like this. Okay, look now chief.

1356
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:38,458
-Take a check! OK, fix it, fix it. -[groans]

1357
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:40,666
Yes chief, now this is your friend, look,

1358
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,083
here, there is slippage in the vertebrae in the lumbar region.

1359
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:46,000
These are compression and contraction. How do we open the contraction?

1360
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,416
We'll take advantage of gravity,

1361
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,625
We're going to take advantage of Newton's discovery of gravity. Look at my asthma friend.

1362
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:54,625
Relax, relax.

1363
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,416
OK, very nice.

1364
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,333
Now look, I'm going to open this up nicely with my friend.

1365
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:02,083
Are you ready? One two Three. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

1366
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:04,166
Mehmet Abi, I hope your technique is good.

1367
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:06,208
-[groans] -[gasps]

1368
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:09,625
We're going to shoot a little from here. We're going to take it for a little while, sir.

1369
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,166
[bones crackle]

1370
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,083

-Download, download, download. -[man groans]

1373
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:19,125
-Get up, come like this. -[groans]

1374
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,250
Stop son, don't fall. Stand up.

1375
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:23,958
How's your waist? Nothing in your waist, recovery?

1376
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:27,500
Son, has your back not healed? One two Three. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim!

1377
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:28,958
-[bones crackle] -[gasps]

1378
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:32,583
-[bones crackle] -[sighs and groans]

1379
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:33,541
[breath held]

-[groans] -[bones crackle]

[crowd grunts]

1382
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:42,875
-How? -[cries of joy]

1383
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:44,750
[a confused hum]

1384
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:46,208
[man screams with joy]

1385
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,166
Did you see?

1386
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,625
[cries of joy]

1387
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,708
That's it!

1388
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:56,708
Alley! Alley!

1389
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,625
[cries of joy]

1390
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,541
Joyful! street

1391
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:30,000
Welcome to the Nahu Tribe, your homeland, your first home.

1392
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,875
This necklace is a necklace of courage.

1393
01:12:37,666 --> 01:12:39,958
Keep it and don't give it to anyone.

1394
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:45,416
Dumb necklace, tin.

1395
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:53,666
This title shows your strength. You are one of us now!

1396
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:56,416
Welcome to the club!

1397
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,166
[tribal unison] Sokachu! Alley! Alley!

1398
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:04,208
-Street man! Alley! Alley! -[roars]

1399
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:08,791
Alley! Alley! Alley! Alley!

1400
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:10,041
[mute sound]

1401
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,583
[spits]

1402
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:22,250
God bless you! Where does this come from? Where does spit come from?

1403
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:24,750
God damn you!

1404
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,458
-[clears his throat] -Is there such a thing? No no! Beware!

1405
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:31,166
-[clears throat] -Don't! Go away!

1406
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:35,083
The incoming spit, the outgoing spitting. What kind of Sokaçu is this?

1407
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,708
Oh, my brother, spitting is a sign of love.

1408
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:40,166
It means welcome.

1409
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,625
Are you welcome like this? I'll get you into Sokaçu like this!

1410
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:46,166
Do you welcome like this? Damn, am I not Street?

1411
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,041
After that, I banned the damn spit.

1412
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:50,708
"Welcome" will no longer be spit. My first act.

1413
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:54,250
[drum rhythms]

1414
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:22,583
Take this, eat it. Nice meal.

1415
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:25,666
Thank you, thank you. We just ate, thanks. Let's not eat.

1416
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,875
No, this is holy food. Good, eat, eat.

1417
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:31,333
My God, what is this? What's this?

1418
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:32,916
This is good food, eat.

1419
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,750
Look, I trust you.

1420
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:37,791
Let's have a taste, it's a shame if we don't look anymore.

1421
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,333
Hadi bismillah.

1422
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,708
Oh this thing, okay... Okay okay, this thing, take a look.

1423
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:48,708
Take it, you will understand immediately. This thing...

1424
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,666
It's on the tip of my tongue, what was it?

1425
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:55,250
-This is a rhino, a rhino. -Okay, rhino!

1426
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:56,416
All right, rhino.

1427
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:01,166
Rhino. I was going to say, I was going to say, I was going to say an ethnic animal, a rhino.

1428
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:02,583
So is his meat, ethnic.

1429
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:04,916
It tastes ethnic. Rhino, that's right. Beautiful.

1430
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,583
-Where is the rhino? Delight part, back? -It's a rhino organ.

1431
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:12,000
Which organ? Internal organ?

1432
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:14,250
Large rhino organ.

1433
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:19,166
-Antrikot? Where? - Rhinoceros dick organ, dick.

1434
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,416
Mm-hm.

1435
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:24,791
-The dick? - His dick organ.

1436
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:25,875
Your rhino?

1437
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,583
-Good, eat. -Beautiful.

1438
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:29,625
[spits] Whoa God damn you!

1439
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:33,083
-Take this, take it! -[laughs]

1440
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:36,041
I wouldn't mind this Street! Give me a drink.

1441
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:38,875
Stuck on my neck, rhino's dick stuck! Give it!

1442
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:40,416
[laughter]

1443
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,500
[clears throat and gags]

1444
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:47,375
I swear I'm going to vomit now! I'm going to take it out. This is beautiful, what is it?

1445
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,250
Bu, you say you say.

1446
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:52,916
-Oh, ugamba mugamba. What is its content? -Ugamba, the white bat.

1447
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,833
Mm.

1448
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:56,708
So you named the drink white bat, good.

1449
01:15:56,791 --> 01:16:03,000
No, ugamba mugamba. Ugamba, the white bat. Mugamba, his piss.

1450
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,291
I mean, white bat piss.

1451
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,583
Puh God bless you! Take this!

1452
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,916
-What kind of tribe are you? -[laughs]

1453
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,416
Doesn't your animal have any other place? You're stuck there.

1454
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,500
No sir, no rhino's dick, no piss, no bat's poop.

1455
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,708
Give, give fruit, let the taste of my mouth change.

1456
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:21,166
I don't eat anything other than these, I only eat fruit.

1457
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,291
-Fruit. [laughter] -I only eat fruit.

1458
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:25,625
[drum rhythms]

1459
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:33,291
[screams]

1460
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:37,041
That's how the story started. We were going to Konya, then it ended in Kenya.

1461
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,916
This is the result. Look, see if we look alike.

1462
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,666
-[grumbles] -[laughs]

1463
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:42,958
-Oldu mu? -Hop hop hop!

1464
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:44,583
What are you doing, Recep?

1465
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,833
You blew my mind, idiot! What are you doing there?

1466
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:50,333
Ya Recep, let's get away from here when they think you are Sokaçu.

1467
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:54,250
Hey, let's go! Let's go and feed the wolf. Let's go and let the lions cover us.

1468
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:57,125
-We have to stay here right now. -Why Recep?

1469
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:59,291
-Didn't you send a message from here? -I sent.

1470
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:04,958
If those messages reach the addressee, they will detect us from the GSM network.

1471
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:07,000
They will find our place, our homeland.

1472
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:09,291
We have to stay here so they can find us.

1473
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:13,041
- That's right, brother. That's why we can't move anywhere.

1474
01:17:13,125 --> 01:17:13,958
Ok bro.

1475
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,208
By the way, I pee a lot.

1476
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:18,625
I'll take a pee here. Wait.

1477
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:19,791
Ya Recep, be careful.

1478
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,708
I can't take it anymore Zouya, when will you talk to your father?

1479
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:27,791
I can't talk to my father, Songa. Nahu says no.

1480
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,208
-Then I will talk to your father. -No way, Songa!

1481
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:33,666
My father will kill you.

1482
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,208
-I love you. -What is it?

1483
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,541
-I can not stand. -Who is he?

1484
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:41,541
-I love you too, Songa. -Psst!

1485
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:44,791
Lan! Songa!

1486
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,250
No, son. Who is this girl?

1487
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:49,166
-No, brother, there is no one. -How is it, son?

1488
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,500
I saw it with my own eyes.

1489
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:54,083
Did you throw a girl over the damn fence? Damn you, you're a big man!

1490
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:55,750
Oh man, this girl is my lover.

1491
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:58,333
-Darling, are you serious with this girl? -Yes brother.

1492
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,166
Hey, I got it, it's done now.

1493
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,500
-Who is this girl? -This girl is the daughter of the Hunkutu.

1494
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:03,500
Who are the Hunkuts?

1495
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:05,208
Ya brother, our enemy is the tribe.

1496
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:08,041
-So, what are you doing with this girl? -I love it, though.

1497
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:08,958
I'm in love with him.

1498
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:13,666
You said love, you melted all my fat. Blind love.

1499
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:15,791
I understand your situation son.

1500
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:19,208
Okey brother. But please don't share it with anyone. With no one.

1501
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:21,625
Medicine, pit, medicine! Did you understand?

1502
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:22,958
OK, I trusted you.

1503
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:25,625
Don't worry, it's between us. Trust in me.

1504
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,708
No! No! I said no!

1505
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:31,791
A Nahu cannot marry a Hunkut, Songa!

1506
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:35,166
Thanks bro, you burned me! You wouldn't share it with anyone?

1507
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,250
Who did I share it with, son? Did I put it on Twitter?

1508
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,125
Did I share it on Instagram?

1509
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:42,583
-What have I done? -Hunboxes are my enemies!

1510
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,500
Nothing like this will happen while I'm alive! Never!

1511
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:48,625
What should I do, dad? I love it though.

1512
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:51,500
-Let's go, let's make up then! -Hush, I said shut up!

[speaks in native language]

1515
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,875
-Oh dad! -Look, you're talking wrong to your father too.

1516
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,500
I mean, you're stepping on the man's vein, too.

1517
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:04,833
It's not like "Oh daddy" or something like that. Please.

1518
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:09,166
What did I tell you? If my father hears, it will never happen, this love will never happen!

1519
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,666
You finished me, brother, you destroyed me!

1520
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:15,125
okay man! Don't whine here. Do you love this girl son?

1521
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,916
-Go on, bro! -Do you like it or not, son?

1522
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:21,166
-A lot! -Since you love this girl so much,

1523
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:24,625
Then we will go, we will ask his father.

1524
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:27,875
If he gives, he gives. If he doesn't, we will kidnap the girl and come, okay?

1525
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,916
-How will you do it, brother? We're going to do cross-border operations.

1526
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,666
Take the man you trust the most with you.

1527
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,750
And I'll take my humanoid animal,

1528
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:37,500
We will go to Hunkutu village with the first light of the morning.

1529
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:38,666
Okey brother.

1530
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,041
My name is Sokaçu. I will not let the lovers stay apart!

1531
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:44,583
-Okey brother. -I'll take it out, I'll take it immediately!

1532
01:19:44,666 --> 01:19:45,875
-Did you understand? -Understood.

1533
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,833
Gentlemen, we had a very good transfer. You stay here

1534
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:00,041
You are scouting.

1535
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:02,875
If we do not come, immediately run to the village and bring the Nahu.

1536
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:03,791
-OK. -Joyful,

1537
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:05,958
You go ahead, Songa, you show the tent.

1538
01:20:06,041 --> 01:20:07,291
You are following too.

1539
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,458
-Okey brother. -Come on, have a blessed war, lions.

1540
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:13,458

Twin axles you! Keep going, keep going.

1545
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:04,750
Yup. We have successfully completed the transfer, my friends.

1546
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:07,750
What we have to do is figure out which tent it is.

1547
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:09,416
Oh brother, I don't know him.

1548
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,666
-How do you not know? -I don't know bro.

The cow is attacking until you know it, idiot!

1552
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,500
Brother, the girl stays in the big tent.

1553
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:23,166
I think he will stay in the big tent.

1554
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:26,125

I will kill you!

What about my friend, did we enter your tent on purpose?

1565
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,375
We entered your tent without knowing it.

1566
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:15,958
How do we know it's inside?

1567
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:18,500
If we already knew, be sure we wouldn't go in!

1568

Shall we go to your tent to see this bet face?

1647
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:48,750
Try it, do it.

Yes, it does, nice.

1650
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:59,958
It will, it will. We also had a hard time at first. Yes, good, it will, it will be more beautiful.

1651
01:27:00,041 --> 01:27:01,416
-Who are we? -[warriors] Nahu!

1652
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,500
-Kumiss? -Nahu!

01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:01,125
You couldn't catch the man yet! You couldn't catch the man!

1670
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:02,958
We are three or four people, look at this situation.

1671
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:06,916
Let's see, bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

1672
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12,125

[sighs]

1677
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,625
[groans] Good.

1678
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,041
You are fundamental, you are firmly seated.

1679
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:34,666
But now you're getting an Ottoman slap mixed with Nahu, are you ready? Look good.

1680
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:35,958
[spits]

1685
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:52,541

Next game, walk on fire! Let it begin!

1690
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:24,625
I swear they have been walking on the chord since they were born. Look at this.

1691
01:29:24,708 --> 01:29:27,458
Brother, they already put it so that you won the competition.

1692
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:30,708
I am aware of that too, but is it the place, Anatolian child?

1693
01:29:30,791 --> 01:29:33,791
We are prepared for anything legal or illegal, Nurullah.

1694
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:35,791
Keep the mix I told you on my feet.

1695
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:39,416
-Will it work, brother? -It will work, son, I watched it in the documentary.

1696
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,708
It creates a layer of air under the foot.

1697
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:43,833
The air layer blocks the fire.

1698
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:46,041
I'm doing stretching, drive it off.

1699
01:29:50,416 --> 01:29:51,583

I'm stretching, I'm stretching.

1703
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:02,250
I'm doing body stretching. Did you drive?

1704
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:04,500
-Okey brother. -Did you drive?

1705
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:07,750

Load it, load it! what are you doing?

Stop, let go! Go away! I don't need any of you! [groans]

1714
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,708
[screams]

1715
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:54,208
[screams wildly] That's it! That's it!

1716
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:04,000
my mother! This is slipping, son! Look at the man, he looks like a mih Nurullah!

1717
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:05,625
Mom, I'm running out of strength!

1718
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:06,583
[shouts]

1719
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:09,791

God bless you!

1726
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:28,875
Hunkutu will not draw!

1727
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:34,041
Hunkut brave! Marok, the lord of the forest, solves this!

1728
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:37,458
-[kabile] Marok! Mark! -Nahu?

1729
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:38,833
Do you have the courage?

1730
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,541
Nahus are never afraid!

1731
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:50,083
-Marok, it's accepted! -[tribe] Marok!

1732
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:54,000
-Look at me, what's Marok, son? -The largest snake of the Marok forest.

1733
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:56,500
-Anaconda. -Anaconda?

1734
01:31:56,583 --> 01:31:58,750
Yes, Sokachu, anaconda.

1735
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:02,375
No one has lived up to this time trying to get his egg.

1736
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:04,958
No, chief, not anaconda. No, don't accept it.

1737
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:09,500
-Do not accept. -Alright. Who will go from the Hunkuts?

1738
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:12,625
-We dig! - [kabile] We dig!

1739
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:14,333
Who will join the Nahu?

1740
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:16,208
Let's go to the street and see.

1741
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:19,125
Why am I leaving, idiot? I go to every shit.

1742
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,541
I'm not going, no! Pack up your own ass.

1743
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:23,208
Sokaçu to everything, Sokaçu to everything.

1744
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:25,416
Anaconda says chief, I cannot go to anaconda.

1745
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,666
I'm having a hard time dealing with that many cobras, please. Anaconda does not come to me.

1746
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:32,541
-Street man! -[tribe] Streetmen! [cheer]

From the two villages, until the sun goes down...

1749
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:44,416
The bravest man will go and bring Marok's egg!

1750
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:47,583
Whoever gets it first, wins!

1751
01:32:47,666 --> 01:32:50,500
Acceptance! The Hunkuts will win!

1752
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:53,083
[tribe] Hunkutu! Hunkut! Hunkut!

1753
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:57,791
-Nahular kazanacak! -I know! Nahu! Nahu!

1754
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:08,708
-Lan Songa, where is this Marok? -Be careful bro, it can happen anywhere.

1755
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:12,333
What I know is that the snake is like this under a stone or a log. It happens in a cool place.

1756
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,958
Brother, this is a very big snake, anaconda.

1757
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:16,500
Brother, shall we look at the riverside?

1758
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:19,250
What do we have to do with the river? We are in the forest right now!

1759
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:21,541
Anam, Marok!

1760
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,500
I joked, I joked.

1761
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,958
What is it? Whoa!

1762
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:35,291
-Are these eggs Marok's? -Yes brother, it's too big

1763
01:33:35,416 --> 01:33:37,958
Hoot! It has eggs as big as Nurullah's head.

1764
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:40,625
If its egg is like this, how is this animal?

1765
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:42,666
Brother, this big snake is anaconda.

1766
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,416
-Nurullah. -Yes bro.

1767
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,916
-See those eggs? -I see it, brother.

1768
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,583
-Come on, take two, run and grab it. -I can't go, brother.

1769
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:53,291
I swear I'll spend a day with you! What are you for? What are you for?

1770
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:56,750
-Come on, Songa. -Brother, I can't go.

1771
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:59,875
God bless you! Why did you come with me then?

1772
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:02,916
Have you come to take a walk in the meadow? Am I going to all the shit?

1773
01:34:03,541 --> 01:34:04,791
Give it, give it!

1774
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:08,541
Look at me. I went there,

1775
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:11,791
If you sense danger, you will come to help immediately!

1776
01:34:11,875 --> 01:34:12,833
-Okey brother. -Okay?

1777
01:34:12,916 --> 01:34:14,916
-Okay, Recep. -Look, don't leave me alone.

1778
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,916
-Okey brother. -Look, I'm in danger of life.

1779
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,833
Let me love your eyes, when you see the danger, come running.

1780
01:34:19,916 --> 01:34:20,833
-OK. -Do you promise?

1781
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,375
-Promise. -Promise, promise.

1782
01:34:22,458 --> 01:34:23,750
Come on bismillah... [sighs]

1783
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:30,541
-No, my son is here, that's not it. -Brother, come, come, come.

1784
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:32,375
Come on bro, come get the eggs.

1785
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,416
No, not here. The animal is not here.

1786
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:38,250
My brother can be anywhere, come here.

1787
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:42,250
-Dangerous! -Nurullah. Do you look at the egg? Look, look!

1788
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:45,791
-Let me love your eyes, brother, please! -Look at this Nurullah.

1789
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:47,791
It's literally like this...

1790
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:52,166
butter, in a pan, it makes a good menemen.

1791
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:55,041
Oh! You will dip the bread like this, you will stretch it like this...

1792
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,458
-you will eat, full menemenlik. -Let go of your menemen!

1793
01:34:58,541 --> 01:35:00,833
There is nothing to be afraid of, but you exaggerated the animal.

1794
01:35:00,916 --> 01:35:02,583
She left her egg here, she's gone.

1795
01:35:02,666 --> 01:35:04,333
Who knows which snake is doing something?

1796
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:07,666
Did you understand? He got the job done here, too.

1797
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:10,083
Come on, get the eggs, bro! This job is no joke!

1798
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:13,708
This is obviously her waitress. Did you understand? It's not his home.

1799
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,416
-It comes once in a while. -It's home, brother, come!

1800
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,333
Huh?

1801
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:19,916
There was a snap.

1802
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,750
-Come on, brother, please! -I'm coming.

1803
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:24,458
Please, come bro, come!

1804
01:35:24,541 --> 01:35:26,375
-Marok. -Abi al gel, al gel.

1805
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:28,833
-Marok, come on, son. [lip smacking] -Brother, please come.

1806
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:30,958
-Please! -No, not here.

1807
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,625

1808
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:34,666

Hey, I brought eight or ten eggs in case you want eggs.

01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:50,541
You can make nice sausage eggs with them, you can break them.

Well then, the Nahus were the winners!

How is it?

1885
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:45,916
Were you a warrior? Where were you squabbling at each other?

01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,375
One of dynamite?

1887
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:50,083
The village would blow up if there were no wells here.

1888
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:53,166
It became a well, if I didn't cover it, it would fly again.

1889
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:56,416
I sat down and popped it in my ass. I got all the pressure.

1890

Do I have to?

1891
