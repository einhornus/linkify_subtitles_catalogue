1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,083
I'm not available. Get lost, please!

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:27,166
Dear God, didn't you hear what I said?
Who is this at this hour?

3
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,000
-Who's ringing the bell?
-I am.

4
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,083
-Are you?
-Yes.

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,750
Are you tall enough to ring it?

6
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,916
-You're being rude.
-Rude? Why is that?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,458
-Why are you disturbing me?
-I've a letter for you.

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,041
If you do, then throw it under the door.
You're closer to it.

9
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,583
Kakader. Yes! It's from the association.

10
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,583
It must be important. Here, take this.

11
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,500
"We'd be honored to see..."

12
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,625
-What?
-What does it say?

13
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,166
It's none of your business!

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,833
It's a private letter for me.
Don't make me go nuts and break your neck!

15
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:06,875
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,833
It says: "We'd be honored
to see you among us

17
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,958
at the 6th White Beans Festival of Konya,

18
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,625
organized by
the Karaambar Truck Drivers' Association."

19
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:18,750
It must be good news.

20
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,208
There's no better news than this, bitch!
I'm telling you!

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,208
There's no better news!
Nurullah! I've got great news!

22
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,708
I've got great news, Nurullah!

23
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,875
I've got great news, Nurullah!

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,708
-There he is!
-Who's this guy?

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,541
-Recep is coming!
-Here, have some!

26
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:38,750
Please, move away. I don't want to eat.
Please, let me go my way.

27
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,833
-We insist. Have some!
-No, thank you. I don't want to.

28
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:45,083
I said let me be! I don't want to eat.
Come on, let me go!

29
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,000
Nurullah!

30
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,125
Don't burst my balloons!
Why are you doing that?

31
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,791
Nurullah!

32
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:01,708
What's up?

33
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,500
No, don't!

34
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,625
-Stop it!
-There you go! Move!

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,083
Nurullah!

36
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,166
Nurullah! Nurullah, I've got great news!

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,083
Yay! I've got great news! Nurullah!

38
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,791
-What's the score?
-It's two-two.

39
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,125
Adios, then. Have fun. Nurullah!

40
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,041
I've got great news! Nurullah!

41
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,333
I've got great news!
Come on, take a seat! Come on! Sit.

42
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,875
-I swear I'm about to have a heart attack.
-Why are you pushing yourself so hard?

43
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,375
I've got great news for you. Great news!

44
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,458
Here, read it.

45
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:07,208
"We'd be honored to see you among us
at the 6th White Beans Festival of Konya."

46
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,291
-White Beans Festival?
-Yep. White Beans Festival.

47
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,875
-Where is it?
-In Konya.

48
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,750
-In Konya?
-Yeah, in Konya.

49
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,541
Konya, the city where time stops,
an awe-inspiring city,

50
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,000
where you can see thousands
of shades of green.

51
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,916
My grandfather was a Mevlevi member
in the Ottoman era.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,125
He was interested in Sufism.
That's why I want to visit Konya.

53
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,000
It's great news, then.
Two birds with one stone.

54
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,833
You'll both visit Konya
and eat tons of white beans.

55
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,375
<i>We</i> will have. <i>We</i> will visit.

56
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:39,375
You mean, plural second person singular?
Because we're going together.

57
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,583
-No, man, I can't go.
-What do you mean you can't?

58
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,250
Am I supposed to go alone?
Aren't you my best buddy?

59
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,708
-You'll go with me.
-Who will run this place?

60
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:51,041
I don't give a damn! Did you ask
my opinion when you started to run it?

61
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,875
Your friend is invited
to the White Bean Festival.

62
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,916
-As a friend, you should join him.
-No, Recep, I can't.

63
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,375
Goddamn you! I don't care
if you don't come with me!

64
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,500
I don't care!

65
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,333
From this moment on,
our friendship is over.

66
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,375
You and I aren't friends anymore!

67
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,500
-I don't care! Go to hell!
-Calm down, Recep. I'm sorry.

68
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,458
-I'm coming.
-No, you're not!

69
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:18,250
Are you trying to do me a favor by telling
me that you'll come? I don't need it!

70
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,458
Stop acting like a kid! Okay, I'm coming.

71
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,750
-Are you sure?
-I am, Recep.

72
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,666
Then buy us the tickets, come on.

73
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,708
Why am I buying the tickets?

74
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,458
You're the one inviting me.
Why am I buying them?

75
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,000
Of course you're buying them!
Are you my best buddy or what?

76
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,958
Buddies do that. If you're my buddy,
then you're the one paying for them.

77
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,625
You make the customers pay more.

78
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,875
You ask for six times
what people should pay.

79
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,375
I have 325 liras of pension
thanks to my grandmother.

80
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,916
How can I buy the tickets?
I bought bitcoin with what I could save.

81
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,166
And I went bankrupt.
I bought at 17,000 and it fell to 3,000.

82
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,500
I screwed up so badly.

83
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,458
Your nephew's a tourism professional,
right? Call him.

84
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,666
He might get some free tickets for us.
Call him.

85
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,750
God, we're going to Konya.

86
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,750
It'll be one hell of a festival, Nurullah.
Trust me.

87
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,666
Is it ringing?

88
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,958
-Hello?
-How are you, son?

89
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,833
-How is he?
-I'm fine, Uncle.

90
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,833
-You know, I'm busy with work, as usual.
-He's fine.

91
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,833
-Cool.
-We're planning a trip.

92
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,875
Don't worry, Uncle. I'll help you.
For how many people?

93
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,250
-Two. Recep and myself.
-I'm sorry. Come again, Uncle.

94
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,916
-Two, son.
-Yeah, two.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,750
-Oh, two.
-Yep, for two people.

96
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,458
-Okay, Uncle. Where do you want to go?
-To Konya.

97
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,500
-I'm sorry, to where?
-To Konya!

98
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,125
Hello? I can't hear you properly, Uncle.

99
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,750
-Hello? Can you hear me?
-Is there a signal?

100
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,125
-Yeah. Two bars.
-Damn your operator!

101
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,791
I can't hear you. Please go somewhere
where you can get a stronger signal.

102
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,125
Son, it's Konya!

103
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,958
I can hear the "ya" part,
but not the first part.

104
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,583
-It's Konya!
-It's Konya!

105
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,666
I said it's Konya!

106
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,708
-Oh, Kenya!
-Hello?

107
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,333
-Okay, it's Kenya. Good choice, Uncle.
-Hello?

108
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,375
-Okay, Uncle, great choice.
-Finally!

109
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,375
-What's the exact date?
-He's asking the date for the trip.

110
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,833
-The festival is on Sunday 15th.
-The departure is on Sunday 15th.

111
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,541
Uncle, I'm warning you.
One way will be more expensive.

112
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,208
-He says it'll be more expensive.
-It's not my concern, you know.

113
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:23,958
Uncle, I have a great tour program,
departure on 13th and return on 16th.

114
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,041
You'd love it.

115
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,208
He has a tour program
between 13th and 16th.

116
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,416
-Okay, take it.
-Okay. We'll take the tour.

117
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
-Great.
-Will we visit everywhere?

118
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
-Tell us about the route.
-The plains and stuff?

119
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,791
Is there a trip to the plains?

120
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,583
The plains, natural beauties,
historical places.

121
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,708
-You're going to visit them one by one.
-We'll visit everywhere.

122
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,375
Private vehicles will arrive
at your doorstep

123
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,875
and take you
everywhere on the route, Uncle.

124
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,458
Private vehicles will take us.

125
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,208
-Excellent. And the accommodation?
-The accommodation?

126
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,375
You'll be staying at four star hotels.

127
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,250
-Four star hotels.
-Four?

128
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:01,125
I was expecting five, but four is fine.
Okay. Take the tour.

129
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,250
It's okay for us.

130
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,916
Uncle, I'm warning you.
It's different there. It'll be very hot.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,291
Be careful and dress appropriately.

132
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,666
He says it'll be very hot.

133
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,833
Oh, really? I thought it'd be colder!
Of course it'll be hotter!

134
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,958
It receives a lot of sunlight!

135
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,833
We're talking about Konya Plains here.
Death Valley!

136
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,583
Recep knows about the place.
He knows it'll be hotter.

137
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,125
Anything else we need to do?

138
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,583
You need to get your passports ready.

139
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,500
Bring them to me
and I'll return them to you on the plane.

140
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,500
Passport?

141
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,750
Passport? Why do we need passports
to go to Konya?

142
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,208
-Security concerns?
-It might be.

143
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,958
As you know, state of emergency is
in effect. It might be because of that.

144
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,958
My passport is at Salih's.
Get it from there.

145
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,458
All right, son.
I'll bring all the documents.

146
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,875
All right, Uncle.

147
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,166
-Are we good?
-We're good.

148
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,125
If we're good, then hang up. Hang up now,
before he changes his mind.

149
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:55,041
I'm so excited! We're going
to a great festival. Give me five!

150
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,458
Easy!

151
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,166
Hello.

152
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:10,125
Take good care of the Red Devil, got it?
Don't leave it alone. Good luck.

153
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,708
Hello, son. Here are the documents.

154
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,708
-Thanks, Uncle.
-Hello, brother.

155
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,583
-Hello.
-Hi, Uncle.

156
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,791
As far as I remember,
I told you dress appropriately.

157
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,416
And we did.
These are my great-grandfather's clothes.

158
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,958
These are the most common clothes
in that area.

159
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,000
If it's okay for you,
then I have nothing to say.

160
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,291
Also, people wear
whatever they want there.

161
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,041
The important thing is
to breathe the same air.

162
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:42,875
Yeah. The important thing is to feel
and be a part of the spirit.

163
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,583
Well said, man.

164
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,250
Now, we need to go to the plane.

165
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,166
-Let's get you vaccinated and go.
-Vaccinated?

166
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,375
What vaccine? What are you talking about?

167
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,791
We weren't told anything
about any vaccine.

168
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,750
It's mandatory by the government.
I've nothing to do with it.

169
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,583
Why should the government mandate
getting vaccinated?

170
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,791
Are we at primary school? Then we should
get checked for mumps and chicken pox.

171
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,458
And we should study for exams!

172
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,666
We go on a trip for three days
and the government can't leave us alone!

173
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,916
Is there anything you can do?

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,833
Unfortunately, no. I wouldn't bother you
with such things if I could do anything.

175
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,375
It's for your own protection,
if anything happens to you there.

176
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:26,125
I'm sure nothing will happen,
but just in case, you know.

177
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,708
It can't be like this.

178
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,583
-Can you give us a moment?
-Okay. You have five minutes.

179
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,750
You need to be ready.

180
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,291
Look, I'm telling you honestly,
I don't like him at all!

181
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,333
-There's something going on with him.
-What?

182
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,625
I'm getting more suspicious
because he's a relative of yours.

183
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,166
All your relatives are cheats
and con artists.

184
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,541
His father ran away with the registrar
after taking his mother's gold jewelry.

185
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:54,708
He deserves a chance. We shouldn't
judge him for his father's sins, I know.

186
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:59,791
But he said passport. First suspicion.
And then the vaccine. Second suspicion.

187
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,500
May God save us from the third one.

188
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,833
If it comes from the government,
it must be necessary.

189
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,708
Nothing else matters
if it's about the country.

190
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,375
I know that! Stop shouting slogans!

191
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,125
I know that!
But I'm talking about a vaccine here.

192
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,291
Okay, move!

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,041
Come on man. Get inside. You too, Uncle.

194
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,583
-Hello. Where should I stand? Here?
-Yes.

195
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,125
He's going first.

196
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,958
-No, Recep, you go first.
-No, you.

197
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,125
-Recep, I'm scared.
-I'm scared, too.

198
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,416
-You first to see if it hurts.
-You're older.

199
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,958
-Come on. Sit!
-Recep, no!

200
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,208
Take a seat, Recep.

201
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,291
Both of you will get it done.
Let's take you first, if you like.

202
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,583
Goddamn you! Take this.

203
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,625
Take this, too.

204
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,041
Which one do I need to open up?
Right or left?

205
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,416
That's not necessary

206
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,375
-What do you mean?
-We're not doing it on the arm.

207
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,208
Where do you do it, Miss?

208
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,125
On the hip.

209
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,791
-On the hip?
-On the hip. I mean, the buttocks.

210
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:00,333
By buttocks, you mean... the ass?

211
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,916
Yes.

212
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:08,208
We didn't know that. We're getting
mistreated over and over again.

213
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,500
It's unacceptable!

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,666
-What's this for?
-Malaria.

215
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,708
We're going to Konya. What does malaria
have anything to with Konya?

216
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,500
Konya... nice!

217
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,833
Look at her! All doctors are crazy,
after studying for seven to eight years,

218
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,750
after seeing so many corpses
and operations.

219
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,625
Open up.

220
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:33,625
Oh my God! You're so fast, Doc!
I'm not used to it! Look at that!

221
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,333
How can you say open up right away?

222
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,208
You haven't said anything. Left or right?

223
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,291
-It doesn't matter.
-It really does!

224
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:46,000
Just like the arms, there are two parts.
Which one should I open up, left or right?

225
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,916
I don't care if it's left or right.

226
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,083
Then I'll open the right one.

227
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,333
Generally I get vaccinated
on the right cheek. Oh, God!

228
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,166
-Is that enough for you?
-It is.

229
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,666
It hurts!

230
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,000
-I haven't even touched it yet!
-Okay, then.

231
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,125
-It hurts!
-The syringe's still in my hand!

232
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,000
Doc, please let me know before you do it.
I need to be ready.

233
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,500
Okay. Take a deep breath.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,666
Oh, my dear God! It hurts so badly!

235
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,916
-Which seat, Nurullah?
-Eight, man.

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,416
-Eight?
-Yep.

237
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,208
We're at the back again.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,291
-Nurullah?
-Yeah?

239
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,416
-Are you sure we're on the right plane?
-Yeah, I know these people.

240
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,916
We were together at the gates.
Hello, Auntie.

241
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Auntie? What auntie? Watch your mouth!
You should call me ma'am!

242
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,708
We're sorry, but what did he call you?

243
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,375
-Old hag?
-Oh!

244
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,083
-Did he call you old dog?
-Oh!

245
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,166
He called you auntie!
Don't take it so hard.

246
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,291
You're like an auntie.
If he called you ma'am, it'd be an insult.

247
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,541
You're rude!

248
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,625
Come on Nurullah. Give them to me.

249
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,250
Give me the luggage.

250
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,208
Let's have a good flight.

251
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,583
Here we go.

252
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,250
Do you see anything strange
on the plane, Nurullah?

253
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,750
-No, man.
-How can you not?

254
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,208
-There are more black people.
-You're right.

255
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,000
-Why?
-I don't know.

256
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,291
Think about it.

257
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,625
-Nothing comes to mind.
-The power of Konya.

258
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,958
What does Mevlana say?

259
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,500
-Come out of the blue?
-Goddamn you!

260
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:30,500
You idiot. It's Seda Sayan's line.
Mevlana says: "Come, whoever you are."

261
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:35,458
As you can see, people from
all over the world are going to Konya.

262
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,250
Here's the announcement.

263
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,875
Have you fastened it?

264
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,833
-Hey, did you fasten your seatbelt?
-Yes.

265
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,708
-Where are you from?
-Yes.

266
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,916
-What?
-Yes.

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,250
You say yes to everything. I don't get it.

268
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,250
All right, then. Konya, here we come.

269
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,666
I want it to be a good flight, Captain.
Let's take off.

270
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,500
Oh my God! Allahu Akbar!
What's happening, Nurullah?

271
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,791
It's nothing. It's just turbulence.

272
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,583
How can you be so calm?

273
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,708
It's nothing! It's just turbulence!

274
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,250
You're talking about turbulence
as if you fly 50,000 miles a year!

275
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,958
What time is it?

276
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,416
-1:37 pm.
-1:37 pm?

277
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,041
-You mean it's been 3.5 hours?
-That's right.

278
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,750
How is it possible, Nurullah?

279
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,583
-It's so weird.
-What do you mean?

280
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,750
-How long does it take to get to Ankara?
-One hour.

281
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,958
So? Konya is near Ankara. It should be
one and a half hours to Konya.

282
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,666
It's been three and a half hours.
There must be something wrong.

283
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,916
-Is it because of traffic in the air?
-Yeah, you might be right.

284
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,916
The traffic is terrible at rush hour.

285
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,583
Especially the Istanbul-Konya bridge.
You idiot!

286
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,916
Traffic in the air? It's empty.
You just go.

287
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,208
There's traffic at take-off and landing.

288
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,791
I need to ask about it. It's not good.
It shouldn't take three and a half hours.

289
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,916
Ma'am, excuse me.

290
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,291
Hey, come here. I've pushed the button.

291
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,083
You... you need to come.

292
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,166
Where did he come from?

293
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,708
How can I help you, sir?

294
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,333
I didn't ask for you.

295
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,000
No, but she's busy with the service.
I can help you.

296
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,916
I pushed the button.

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,291
She and I had eye contact. As she was
about to come, you took her place.

298
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:34,833
Why did you do this? Is this your area?
You were serving sandwiches back there.

299
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,166
-What are you doing here?
-I don't understand.

300
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,875
Anyway, we checked the time
and we got confused.

301
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,250
It's been three and a half hours
and it shouldn't take much more.

302
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:48,291
Yes sir. We have three hours left,
so, it'll take longer.

303
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,500
How can we have three more hours left?

304
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,166
How long does it take to get to Konya?

305
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,291
From Istanbul to Konya... I'm not sure,
but it must be approximately...

306
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,375
Oh my! What's your problem?

307
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,333
A flight attendant should be nice
to the customers.

308
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,833
You're anything but nice!

309
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,166
-It's not on my flight route.
-I don't care about your route!

310
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,083
Anyway, we've been in the air
for three and a half hours.

311
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,125
You said three hours to go.
That's six and a half.

312
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,916
Six minus one and a half is five.
Tell me about this five-hour difference.

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,958
Yes, it takes an hour and a half to Konya,
but this isn't the flight to Konya.

314
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,083
-Where to, then?
-To Kenya, sir.

315
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,125
-Kenya?
-Yeah, Kenya.

316
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,166
Isn't this the flight to Konya?

317
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,208
Konya? No sir, it's to Kenya.
You must be kidding.

318
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,208
Wait a minute! Is this plane
going to Kenya right now?

319
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,166
-Yes, it's going to Kenya.
-What's he saying, Nurullah?

320
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,875
We were told it's going to Konya.
It should be Konya.

321
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,125
-No, it's Istanbul-Kenya.
-You're kidding.

322
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,750
-No, I'm not kidding, sir.
-Tell me you're kidding.

323
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,666
-I'm not kidding.
-It's not Kenya.

324
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,750
-Let go of me! I said let go of me!
-Are you kidding me? Huh?

325
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,125
-Is this a bad joke?
-Will you let go of me, please?

326
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,125
I want to talk to the pilot!

327
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:02,000
-I want to talk to the pilot!
-Sir, stop it!

328
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,541
-I want to go to Konya, not Kenya!
-I said stop it!

329
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:10,916
Take us to Konya and then go to Kenya!

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I want to go to Konya!

331
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,833
-Move away. Move!
-What's happening?

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,166
What? He should pass out now!
Why isn't he passing out?

333
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,083
Did it work?

334
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,416
Look at us! We're in Kenya, not Konya!

335
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,416
One letter shouldn't make
such a difference!

336
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,666
Put E instead of O
and here's the difference!

337
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,375
You need to be optimistic, man.

338
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,750
We're in Kenya for vacation.
Let's enjoy it.

339
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,500
Optimistic? She gave me 7,000 volts
at 30,000 feet!

340
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,208
I still can't feel my left buttock!
What kind of optimism is that?

341
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,291
Take it this way!

342
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,166
-What's happening?
-What's happening?

343
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,333
If I miss the White Bean Festival...

344
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,291
then you'll definitely know
what's happening!

345
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,583
Welcome!

346
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,166
Welcome!

347
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,791
Welcome, everyone!
Welcome to beautiful Kenya!

348
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,458
I'm your tour guide Ersin.

349
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,500
How was the flight? Are we tired?

350
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,458
-What? Were you with us, brother?
-I'm sorry?

351
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,625
Were you with us? "Are we tired?"
Are we a group together?

352
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,583
It is just a figure of speech.

353
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,875
The flight was rough.
We're nervous. We're sorry.

354
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,625
Then I'll take you to your tents
and let you rest.

355
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,083
Tents? What's he talking about, Nurullah?

356
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,750
I'm not staying in a tent.
Wasn't it a four star hotel?

357
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,750
-We were told no such thing, Ersin.
-But it's our concept.

358
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,833
Take a look at me and him.
How can we stay in a tent?

359
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,208
How can we stay in the same tent?
He snores, farts

360
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,916
and touches himself at night.

361
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,333
-Are you any different to me?
-Shut up!

362
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,500
Don't worry,
our facility has four star hotel quality.

363
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,166
Trust me, you're going to love it.
Come on.

364
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,916
It's all because of you! Move! Move it!

365
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,250
Here we go.

366
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,916
So, what do you think?

367
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,375
-To be honest, it's better than my house.
-I told you.

368
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,416
Get some rest. It's going
to be a very tiring day tomorrow.

369
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,750
-See you at breakfast at 6:00 a.m.
-Breakfast at 6:00 a.m.?

370
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:17,041
You know what they say? The early bird
catches the worm! See you.

371
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,875
I know this jerk from somewhere, Nurullah,
but where?

372
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,083
Take one.

373
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,666
-I'll take that one.
-Oh, really?

374
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,791
That's mine. This one's yours.
You need to be close to the door.

375
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,875
You'll make first contact with
anything dangerous. Move this way.

376
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,000
Nurullah.

377
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,166
Nurullah.

378
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,875
We're here because of him,
in the middle of Africa.

379
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,750
And he's driving his pigs to the market!

380
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,041
I haven't got used to this bed.

381
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,041
It's like everyone is watching me.
I see eyes everywhere.

382
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,166
What's that?

383
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,916
Damn, it's moving! It's an insect!

384
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,500
Oh! Goddamn it. Now it's on his pants.

385
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,625
Oh, crap, he's so afraid of insects.

386
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,000
What are we going to do? It's so big.

387
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,708
I'm about to throw up!

388
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,958
Oh, damn it.

389
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Look where it landed. Damn,
I'm going to unman him to kill the insect.

390
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,583
There's nothing I can do, Nurullah.
I must hit it.

391
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,625
Okay, here we go.

392
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:46,083
Oh, God, it's moving!
It's going toward his face! Goddamn it!

393
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,916
Oh, I'm about to throw up!

394
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,875
He had a disgusting face. Now his face
is even more disgusting with the insect.

395
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,916
Okay, one, two, three.

396
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,750
Oh, shoot! It's in his mouth now!
Cough it up, Nurullah!

397
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,958
Cough it up, Nurullah! He's dying!
He's dying in Kenya!

398
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,625
He's dying in Kenya!

399
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,791
Cough it up! Come on, Nurullah!

400
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,500
He's dying! He's dying in Kenya!

401
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,333
-He's dying in Kenya!
-It's out!

402
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,333
-Are you sure? Are you sure it's out?
-Yeah, it's out.

403
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,583
-Is it out?
-It's out!

404
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,125
Ah! Jamboo-jamboo. Jamboo-jamboo.

405
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:31,791
No, no. No jamboo or any such thing!
He's my buddy.

406
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,791
He's not jamboo. He's my buddy.

407
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,875
Ah! Kango-jamboo.

408
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,833
Get out of here!
Or I'll hit you with this! Get out!

409
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,208
Good morning to you, too!

410
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,208
Don't start!
Shut up before I break your neck!

411
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:07,500
-You seem nervous today, Recep.
-Oh, no, not at all! I'm very happy!

412
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:11,208
I was going to go to Konya for white beans
and now I'm here eating this!

413
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,333
It's great!

414
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:16,041
I'm quite happy this morning,
while it's 55 degrees Celsius out there

415
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,083
and wild animals are looking at me!

416
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,916
Did I want this? There was a mistake.

417
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,625
Shut up! Shut up!

418
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,583
Don't drive me mad.
Did you call your nephew?

419
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:26,708
Yes, I did.

420
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,250
-When's the return flight, then?
-In three days. It's overbooked.

421
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,916
-We're in the queue.
-Goddamn you, man!

422
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,583
Goddamn you and your freaking nephew!

423
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,333
Screw the midwife
that helped you get born!

424
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:42,583
Creatures like you two
should've disappeared from this world!

425
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,375
-Don't insult me, man!
-Shut up!

426
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,291
Shut up!

427
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,375
Everyone is laughing at me.

428
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,125
Everyone thinks we're lovers
because of what happened.

429
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,333
How could this happen? You humiliated us!

430
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,833
Jamboo-jamboo.

431
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:01,833
It's all because of that bastard.
I'll catch you in the savanna!

432
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,625
And I'll break your neck!

433
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,166
Jamboo.

434
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,125
You see why I'm angry now?

435
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,958
You're angry and nervous,
but you haven't lost your appetite!

436
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:16,083
It's different here. Be careful.
You'll get nauseous.

437
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,708
Yeah, you know all about it
because you lived here

438
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,500
for seven years as an expat and you know
about breakfast culture in Africa!

439
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,833
All your experience! Mind your own food.

440
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,625
You idiot. It's good, like rice wafers.
Do you want some?

441
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,083
-I don't eat that!
-You can. It's great!

442
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,833
-It'll make me sick.
-It's great.

443
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh, my!
Are you serving dessert to each other?

444
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:40,000
Good morning. I hope
you're not too tired after last night.

445
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,625
Because we're going
to watch the great migration.

446
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,166
You see what I mean now?

447
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,833
-What's your name, pal?
-Ersin.

448
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:51,833
Ersin, don't make me beat you up.
Watch it! What are you trying to say?

449
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,958
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Jamboo-jamboo.

450
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,958
What is jamboo-jamboo? What do you mean?

451
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:01,500
The guard saw it and imagining it
for a moment made me nervous.

452
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,333
What did he see?
What are you trying to say?

453
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,500
What are you implying? What's your point?

454
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:11,500
We have no problem with that, of course.
It's your choice, after all.

455
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,916
Yeah, it's my choice.

456
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,125
Now I'll give you some options
and you're going to choose one.

457
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,833
Which one should I say? A, B, C or D?

458
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,125
-I'm sorry?
-Choose one.

459
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,791
What should I say?
A, B, C or D? Which one?

460
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,875
-I'm choosing A.
-Good choice.

461
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,958
There was no slap for B, C and D
but you chose A. It was your choice.

462
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:37,166
Look, dude, I'll tear you in half
and let the lions come to your funeral.

463
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,958
-Get out of here!
-Get out of here!

464
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,791
Get out! Don't push us!

465
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:44,500
Cut the bullshit. Cut it out!
It's all your fault.

466
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,416
I swear I'll stab you!

467
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,833
I'll stab you right here

468
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:51,125
and I'll hang you from the ceiling
by your feet and skin you!

469
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,083
Nothing I do makes you happy, Recep.

470
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,750
We're good to go, huh?
Our safari starts right now!

471
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,125
Oh my God.
I hope they don't get in our vehicle.

472
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,083
We should've gone before they arrived.

473
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:15,750
-Start the engine. Maybe we can escape.
-Hey!

474
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,583
Wait for us!

475
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:30,666
Easy! Where are you going like that?
It's like you're trying to escape.

476
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,625
Sir, we're a bit late
and people can't wait for you, so...

477
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:34,708
Oh, really?

478
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,458
All these people are going
to wait for me, pal!

479
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:42,666
Since you people ruined my routine
and I'm in a place I don't want to be

480
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,083
and since I'm forced to be in Kenya,

481
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,916
-you're going to wait for me!
-Yeah.

482
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,500
If I were in Istanbul,
I'd have breakfast at ten

483
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,375
and then at eleven,
my intestines would start working

484
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,291
and I'd take a dump at twelve.

485
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,208
Here, breakfast is at six.

486
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:58,875
My intestines haven't started to work
and I'm not ready.

487
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:02,791
I don't want to start my day like this,
so, you're going to wait!

488
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:03,833
-Yeah, sure.
-Open it.

489
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,541
-We needed you, for sure.
-Excuse me?

490
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,041
It's so nice of you to join us.
We wouldn't have gone without you.

491
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:16,791
Look, be a good boy and be a nice guide.
Don't make me mad! Okay?

492
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:21,041
Hello. I want you to have a nice tour.

493
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,083
I hope we'll see lots of animals.

494
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,291
Here we go.

495
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,833
Dear friends, this is the place
where mankind was born.

496
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:03,791
The environment around us
is home to 500 different kinds of animals.

497
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:04,875
Take a good look.

498
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,625
-Now I remember where I know him from.
-Do you?

499
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,583
Watch this.

500
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,625
-Excuse me!
-Yes.

501
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,666
Name all 500 one by one.

502
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,375
I'll name them if I have to.

503
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,416
Then name them. I want you to.

504
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,666
Okay. They are rhinos, elephants,
gorillas, lions...

505
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:28,250
-Did I say rhinos?
-Why are you naming the same animals?

506
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,125
Where are the remaining animals?

507
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,375
You can't name the other 496, can you?
You jackass!

508
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:35,708
Remember me?

509
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,250
You and your jokes again, sir.

510
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:44,791
Anyway, all of you are going
to witness the great migration.

511
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,916
We'll get notified via radio
and then we're going to watch it.

512
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,791
So, what's the great migration?

513
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,375
The only one I know about is the one

514
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:54,958
where Turkic tribes migrated
from the Middle Asia to Anatolia.

515
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,416
What's that got to do with this?

516
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,541
Don't underestimate it.
If it weren't for that,

517
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,375
you'd be at the Great Wall of China
selling bottles of water.

518
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,666
This is a migration
where lots of animals migrate to wetlands.

519
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,416
Oh, okay. There's a migration
to work in Istanbul every morning.

520
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,625
No, sir. This one involves animals.

521
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:16,458
It involves violence and survival.
It's a journey of hope.

522
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:18,916
I know.
We're talking about the same thing.

523
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,250
People try to survive every morning.

524
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:25,750
They bite each other to get a seat
on public transport.

525
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:33,208
The vehicles are full of animals. We have
perverts, stalkers, pests, rapists.

526
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,875
I've even seen someone
forcing himself to throw up.

527
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:39,583
Don't interrupt the guide.
I don't want to listen to you!

528
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,791
Is it hard for you, ma'am?

529
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:42,958
Is what hard for me?

530
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:45,083
-The menopause.
-You're shameless!

531
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,166
Please, calm down.

532
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,500
Dear guests,
take a look at these endless plains.

533
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,833
Anything and everything started here.

534
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:58,208
What is it, Recep?

535
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,916
My stomach, Nurullah.
It's killing me, man.

536
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
-I told you not to eat that food, man.
-How do you know it's the food?

537
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:07,166
-Oh, God!
-Are you okay?

538
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,166
I'm not okay at all. My intestines
are full. I need to take a dump.

539
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,750
-You can't get off the vehicle.
-Do you want me to do it here?

540
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,916
Oh, don't do that please. Don't.

541
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,375
But it's too dangerous.
It's full of wild animals.

542
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,458
It's more dangerous to stay here,
I'm telling you.

543
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:26,500
There's going to be an explosion
and it's going to splatter everywhere.

544
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,083
It's knocking on the door!

545
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,250
I don't know what to do.
Maybe you should get off.

546
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,166
-But don't go far.
-Let him go far, far away!

547
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,125
Are you still talking? I swear
I'll do it right next to your feet!

548
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,791
-You're shameless!
-Hellcat!

549
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:45,583
Oh, God! I'm going to the bushes
over there. I'm going to do it there.

550
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:48,666
Oh, shoot.

551
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,250
-Is it going to take long?
-It is. He likes to take his time.

552
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,750
-Damn, it's started.
-What? The migration?

553
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,083
-The migration has started.
-Move, then. Now!

554
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:25,625
I've been waiting for this for a year.
I'm not missing it for some shitty reason!

555
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:28,666
My husband is the most famous lawyer
in Istanbul.

556
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,250
I'll ruin your company
and take everything you have.

557
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,750
We paid for it! Give us our money back
or take us there right now!

558
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,333
We can't go anywhere before he comes back.

559
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:41,375
Oh, God, I don't know what to do.
The migration has started.

560
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:44,000
Everyone wants to watch it,
so we have to go. You!

561
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,750
Get off and stay with your friend.
But don't move a muscle.

562
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:50,708
Hide in the bushes and stay still.
We'll come back after the migration.

563
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:53,541
I'm not leaving my friend alone.
I'm getting off now!

564
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,416
-Get off!
-Don't move a muscle!

565
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,916
We'll be back soon. Stay still.

566
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,416
Come on, hurry up. Move, move!

567
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:06,250
-Recep! Recep!
-Stop there! I'm taking a dump.

568
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:08,916
Okay, I'm waiting here.

569
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,416
People don't leave me alone,
even when pooing!

570
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:17,791
-How do you feel now, Recep?
-Okay, but why are you here?

571
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:22,250
They had to go and I didn't want to leave
you alone, so I got off and came here.

572
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,833
-You got off the vehicle?
-Yes.

573
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,708
-Where is it now?
-It's gone, man.

574
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,500
The great migration has started.

575
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:32,458
Why did you let them go? Why did you
let them go before we got on the vehicle?

576
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,875
The women were raising hell.

577
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,958
Don't make me hit you and raise hell!

578
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,083
Are you stupid or something?
Are you some kind of a moron?

579
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,916
You got off just because
some women were making a scene!

580
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,875
We're in Africa.
There are wild animals here!

581
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,208
How could you get off?

582
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,916
Calm down, man.
They said they'll come back for us.

583
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,583
They said not to go anywhere
and stay in the bushes.

584
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:58,125
You freaking idiot! I've just taken
a dump. It's still hot and it smells.

585
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:02,958
The smell will spread rapidly in Africa.
It'll spread all around here.

586
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:06,333
All the animals like leopards, lions,
cheetahs will come here.

587
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,416
-You want to stay here?
-What are we going to do?

588
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:11,708
Call the camp. Call them quickly!

589
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:14,625
-I have no signal, man.
-Do you have anything at all?

590
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,250
-Anything?
-Let's make the call from your phone.

591
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,750
I don't have it with me.

592
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:22,666
I left it at the camp
because my data roaming is off.

593
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,291
I didn't take it with me.

594
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,583
-What are we going to do?
-There's only one thing we can do.

595
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:31,416
We'll find the camp by following
the tire tracks. It's the only way.

596
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,375
We need to check for lions.
Look, those ones are after the antelopes.

597
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,833
There are too many there.
We'll go this way.

598
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,541
What if they come to this way?

599
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,958
Then here's the plan.

600
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,875
We'll stay together,
then run in different directions.

601
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:47,416
The lions will get confused and follow
one of us. The other will survive.

602
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,625
What if the lions follow me?

603
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,416
I hope they choose you.

604
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,875
If they choose you, run as far as you can.

605
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:57,291
When you're not be able to run, lie down,
cross your arms,

606
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:02,333
raise your head and then start praying.
The lions will handle the rest.

607
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,791
You'll be dead in a few hours.
They'll eat you in four days.

608
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,250
-Don't say that, man!
-Okay, move. Move it!

609
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,166
I'm not the one who got off the vehicle.
Move it! Move!

610
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,666
You should follow the road
for the vehicles.

611
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,916
Why? Because it goes somewhere
one way or the other.

612
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,583
The vehicles have to go somewhere,
after all.

613
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,000
-Nurullah.
-What is it, Recep?

614
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,916
-Dead end.
-Dead end?

615
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,750
-Now we're screwed.
-Why?

616
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,291
-No more road.
-Did we go the wrong way?

617
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:05,291
No, it's impossible. My calculations
showed that the camp was there.

618
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:09,541
It should be there. We've come
all this way and the road ends here.

619
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,041
Yes, the vehicles came from above,
came down and started right here!

620
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,500
It's the wrong way!

621
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,166
Can you give me a moment?

622
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,750
Would you let me manage this crisis?
Move away!

623
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:20,750
Okay, Recep.

624
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,583
-What are you doing?
-Smelling the air.

625
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:34,500
You should've smelt it in the first place!

626
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,125
Get out! Get the hell out!

627
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:39,208
Find your own route,
all the way to hell if you like!

628
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,625
Where can I go, Recep?

629
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:44,208
Soon the lions will catch the sweaty smell
of your ass and come here.

630
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,125
They'll catch and eat us because of you.

631
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,291
-You smell awful.
-I'm sorry.

632
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,708
Just give me a moment!

633
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,875
I've spent my life finding
my way in open fields.

634
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,916
I was a scout
in my three years of education.

635
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,041
-They called me Recep the Little Wolf.
-Okay, man.

636
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:03,166
All right. According to my experience,
I'm telling you, Nurullah,

637
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:07,333
if it's a dead end, we have two options.

638
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,416
We either go left or right.

639
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,916
-I think we should go right.
-Okay.

640
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,666
It's always good to be on the right side.
Let's go.

641
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:55,166
Nurullah. I'm telling you loud and clear
that we're definitely lost.

642
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,625
-Lost?
-Yeah, we're definitely lost.

643
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:01,125
I can't help.
I have no idea where the camp is.

644
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,291
What are we going to do?

645
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:06,833
We need to do something. We're not
going to sit here and cry like a baby.

646
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:09,666
I'm an alpha male. Surviving is in my DNA.

647
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,333
When I was a child, they'd leave me
in a city seven kilometers away

648
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,666
and I'd find my way to the town
in the dark by smell, barefoot.

649
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,166
That's how I roll!

650
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:21,458
Now, sunset is close. We need a plan

651
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:24,958
-to spend the night in the open.
-We're staying in the open?

652
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,250
No, I'm staying here.

653
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:30,166
I arranged a hotel for you! You idiot!
Of course we're staying here!

654
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,833
But not in the open,
we need to have our backs to the forest.

655
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,916
So, we need to go
to where the forest is thick.

656
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,833
Covering our backs with the front clear.
Okay, let's go this way.

657
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,333
Okay, great.

658
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:50,416
It's excellent. Nothing can touch us here.
Our backs are covered by the trees.

659
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,875
The fire's burning here
and our field of view is clear.

660
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,583
We'll can see any enemies.

661
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,916
-We can rest here, Nurullah.
-I hope so, Recep.

662
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,041
Stop hoping and be sure about it!
Wild animals stay away from fire.

663
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:06,500
Because they get scared when they see it.
Do you go near the fire?

664
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,166
No, but they're animals.

665
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,416
You're an animal, too.
You're an animal of some kind.

666
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,708
I can't say that you're a human.
Look at yourself and tell me,

667
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,208
do you feel closer to animals or humans?

668
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,666
Think about it.
Which one do you feel closer to?

669
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,916
I think it's animals,
but don't get me wrong.

670
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,583
I'm an animal, too.
I'm more of a domestic animal.

671
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:28,333
I'm like a cat when I feel secure.
I'm different from you in that regard.

672
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:33,333
Anyway, neither of us go near the fire
and neither do wild animals.

673
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:36,458
And don't overrate wild animals.
Don't overestimate them.

674
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,916
What's a wild animal?

675
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,416
It's the cat family, after all.
Yeah, kitty.

676
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,958
Kitty, man! Don't believe anything
they say about a lion attacking you,

677
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:47,875
or a leopard chasing you
or a cheetah clawing someone.

678
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,833
It's pure bullshit. There's no need
to be afraid of the lions or stuff.

679
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:53,875
They're all kitty cats, after all.

680
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,291
-Dude!
-What?

681
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,875
-Holy crap!
-What are we going to do, Recep?

682
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,166
First, we need to calm down.
We need to be calm.

683
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,625
A wild animal has arrived.
Do you have any food in your bag?

684
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:07,416
-Oh, hey, it's nothing man. Calm down.
-I do.

685
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,166
-What? What is it?
-A sausage.

686
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,666
A sausage? What's it doing in your bag?

687
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,875
Great. The sausage is perfect.
Hey, lion! Look at me, boy. Look.

688
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,041
It includes all the animals.
It's a sausage.

689
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,625
Come on, come closer. Come on, kitty-cat.

690
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:23,000
I'll use this to protect my hand. Here!

691
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:26,250
Here. It has horse and donkey meat in it.
Come on, boy. Oh!

692
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,958
It's clawing so bad!
Come on, take it, boy!

693
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:34,375
Here, take it. Take it, boy. Come on.
Oh my! Look at it clawing!

694
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:41,083
Come on, take it. Take it, boy.
Nurullah, it'll leave us alone soon.

695
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:45,291
Come on, take it!
Here's your sausage! Go get it!

696
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:49,666
Come on! Go get it! I said go!
Go and get the sausage!

697
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:52,541
I said go and get it!
It's not going for the sausage.

698
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:56,666
I need a deterrent right now!
What do you have in your bag?

699
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,583
Nothing!

700
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,833
Goddamn you! You have a sausage,
but no deterrent!

701
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,708
I have an idea.
There's a way to survive. Come with me.

702
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:06,416
Come closer, slowly.
Watch my back. Nice and slow.

703
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,125
Go, go! Run! Run for your life!
Has it caught the smell?

704
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:16,208
Has it? Oh, it's coming.
It's coming for us!

705
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:33,083
<i>Oh, God, dear God!</i>

706
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:40,875
<i>I wish I hadn't got off that vehicle</i>
<i>To take a dump</i>

707
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,291
<i>I made a mistake I know</i>
<i>But why did you follow me, you moron</i>

708
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:52,208
<i>Nurullah! You moron, Nurullah</i>
<i>You're a moron, Nurullah!</i>

709
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,333
<i>We are two lovers and we're very confused</i>

710
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:01,416
<i>We were looking around left and right</i>

711
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,041
<i>We couldn't understand how it happened</i>

712
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:09,500
<i>We were going to go to Konya</i>
<i>But we got stuck in Kenya</i>

713
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:11,791
-Thanks for singing, bro.
-Thank you, man.

714
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:15,875
Take the robes out of your bag
and lay them here to get some sleep.

715
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,416
Tomorrow's another day.

716
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
-Nurullah.
-Yeah?

717
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,916
-Get your hand off me.
-What?

718
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,250
-Get your hand off me.
-I'm not behind you, Recep.

719
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,333
You're not?

720
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:52,750
You really aren't, Nurullah.
Who's behind me, then, Nurullah?

721
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,791
Oh, my God! Get up! Get up!

722
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:01,125
-Back off!
-I don't need this! Don't worry!

723
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:05,291
Calm down! We'll show it who we are!
Don't be weak! What? What do you want?

724
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,041
Let's show it who's more crazy!

725
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,916
-Back off!
-Do you see this?

726
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,375
Three gorillas just like that
in the wilderness!

727
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:21,333
It's amazing. It's like they're performing
some kind of mating ritual.

728
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,750
Come here! Show me what you got!

729
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,041
Hey, help me!

730
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,458
Wow!

731
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,125
I think we should tranquilize them
and bring them to the laboratory.

732
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,125
I think so, too.

733
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,333
Hit it! I'm getting tired!

734
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,666
Shoot the first one, please.

735
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:49,833
-You should hit it you moron, not me!
-It was a mistake, man!

736
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:55,458
What happened?

737
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,875
-Oh, that is good!
-What happened to it?

738
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,500
Did it have a heart attack?

739
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:08,166
Nurullah, he was shot with a dart.

740
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:12,666
There must be people around here.
He was shot with a poisonous dart.

741
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,750
The second one, the next one please.

742
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,583
Oh, my God! Nurullah!

743
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,166
I've been hit in the ass. They shot me!

744
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,750
Oh God! I've been hit in the ass!
And I don't feel my legs!

745
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,750
Wow! It's falling, look at that!

746
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:34,708
Look, I don't feel my legs!
I can't stand! I can't stand, man!

747
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:37,500
Nurullah! Nurullah!
I watched a documentary once.

748
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:38,666
Take the dart off!

749
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,291
-Suck my ass to remove the poison!
-Your ass?

750
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,541
Yeah, my ass! Suck it!

751
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,000
-I can't, Recep!
-Suck it!

752
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,958
-I can't do it, Recep!
-Suck my ass!

753
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:47,625
Suck it before the poison spreads!

754
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:49,666
-Come on, suck it!
-Oh, man!

755
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,583
-What happened?
-I'm hit, Recep!

756
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:52,625
Goodbye.

757
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:56,833
Did you get shot, too?
Goddamn it! Everyone's getting shot!

758
00:44:56,916 --> 00:45:00,666
I'm all alone now! Oh, God! Oh, my God!

759
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,375
It's kicking in now!

760
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:06,041
I can't feel my left side!

761
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:09,750
I can still see!
One of my eyes is still open!

762
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,958
It didn't affect me. My eyes are closing.

763
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,541
-Yay!
-Look at this!

764
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,208
-High five!
-Oh my gosh!

765
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:18,875
-There you go!
-This is incredible!

766
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,916
Let's take them to the lab.

767
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,291
-Let's go.
-Great.

768
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:33,791
-I'm sobering up now.
-Where are we, Recep?

769
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:35,791
I have no idea, Nurullah.

770
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:40,416
They brought it with us.
We must be in some kind of a laboratory.

771
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:45,375
-Did you pee your pants?
-Yeah, I did, Recep.

772
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:48,041
You're an adult, man!
How could you do that?

773
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,125
-I don't feel my legs.
-Here they come.

774
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:54,291
Excuse me, sir.
It's not good what you did.

775
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:57,875
Get us out of here right now.
Why are we being treated like gorillas?

776
00:45:57,958 --> 00:46:00,625
We're humans! Human beings!

777
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:04,750
We're humans. We're men!
A man and a gentleman.

778
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,333
A man and a gentleman.

779
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:11,000
This is very interesting species,
especially the two on the right.

780
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:14,041
We're different from him!
Homo sapiens and sapiens.

781
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:17,416
Sapiens, homo sapiens and sapiens.

782
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,041
-Homo and sapiens.
-I think we should do some tests.

783
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,666
Get us out of here right now!

784
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,541
-Me and my friend, please.
-Start test one, please.

785
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,291
What? He said start. Let's start.

786
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,583
This is so complicated, man!
How can we solve this?

787
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,083
Let's swap them.

788
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,666
Like this?

789
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,250
You're not helping at all!
The animal solved it!

790
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,333
Start test two, please.

791
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,166
What should we do? What's this?

792
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,083
The numbers have gone!
I don't remember how they were aligned.

793
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,250
Please!

794
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:06,250
Goddamn it! It was something like this.

795
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:09,333
That's a real idiot in the middle.
Oh, my God!

796
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,958
-Has it solved it again?
-That's quite clever.

797
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,041
-It's very smart!
-That's not fair!

798
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,833
Its puzzle was so easy!

799
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:20,458
You're favoring it
because it's an animal! What about him?

800
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:24,333
-Don't make me hit you!
-Test number three. Proceed, please.

801
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:26,000
What should we do with it?

802
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:35,333
My hand got stuck!

803
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,125
Watch this.

804
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,708
It sensed the sugar, sir. It did.

805
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:54,875
Oh, come on!

806
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,500
This is how it's done.
I don't need a stick.

807
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,791
Idiot, idiot, smart!

808
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:13,291
Look what we got ourselves into, man!

809
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:20,875
Nurullah.

810
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,250
-What is it, man?
-I have a great idea to escape.

811
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:26,500
Are we digging tunnels?

812
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:30,000
Yep. Do you have a spoon?
We'll dig tunnels like El Chapo did.

813
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:32,375
You idiot! What are you talking about?

814
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:36,333
We'll escape from here
through collective effort.

815
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:39,000
-Are those the keys for our cages?
-Yeah, man.

816
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,666
-Are you sure?
-I am.

817
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,833
-You see the mop over there?
-Yeah.

818
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:48,500
-Stick it in your ass.
-Is this a time for jokes?

819
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:51,125
Anyway, can you reach it?

820
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,750
-I'll try.
-Try it, then.

821
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:54,541
Try to reach it.

822
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:56,500
Can you reach it?

823
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:00,375
-Have you grabbed it?
-I'm trying.

824
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:05,375
-Have you grabbed it? Keep it quiet!
-I've grabbed it!

825
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,333
Be quiet!

826
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,708
-Have you grabbed it?
-I have.

827
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,875
Give it to me.

828
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:17,375
Okay, the first step is complete.

829
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:20,708
Now the second step.
We'll work with the gorilla.

830
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,416
-Bro...
-Hey!

831
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,541
Hey, look at me! Come here.
Be quiet. Take the mop.

832
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:31,708
Come on, take it. Now, turn it.
Come on, turn it upside down.

833
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:37,541
They're right there.
The keys. The keys for the cages.

834
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:42,458
The keys with which you got locked
in there. The keys, idiot! Take them.

835
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:45,666
And we'll escape.
We'll escape together. The keys!

836
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,291
Come on, the keys! They're on the wall!
Reach them with the mop!

837
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:53,208
Reach them with it and take them.

838
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,333
Stick it.

839
00:49:56,375 --> 00:50:00,708
Stick it! Stick the mop, come on!
Take the keys with it!

840
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:04,416
Goddamn you!
You know how to switch the lights!

841
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,375
You know how to choose the pictures, jerk!
Learn how to use some equipment!

842
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,208
You idiot! I can't do it myself!

843
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,208
You messed up the whole escape plan!

844
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,833
No, man. It's not possible.
That idiot doesn't understand a thing.

845
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,916
He's doing it.

846
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,458
He's doing it! Come on, boy! Come on!

847
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:26,250
Use the mop! Come on!

848
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,541
Good job! Come on, take them.

849
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:29,958
Take them!

850
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:35,000
Take the keys, come on! Take them!
Here you go, take them!

851
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,833
Good job boy! Good job!
Give the keys to me.

852
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,750
Give them to me.

853
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:44,708
Good job, boy! You're the man! Great job!

854
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:49,916
We've got the keys. Let's open the cage
before that idiot wakes up.

855
00:50:58,625 --> 00:50:59,625
Back off!

856
00:51:04,416 --> 00:51:08,375
He hit him right in the head and made him
pass out. Congratulations. Good job.

857
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,083
Move!

858
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:19,208
Run! Run! Move, move!
Move this way! Come on!

859
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:24,625
Come! Come with us, quickly!
Come on! Come here!

860
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,291
Do you want to go that way? Wow.

861
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:31,750
-It's time to say goodbye, then, Charlie.
-How do you know his name?

862
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,000
-Generally they're called Charlie.
-Charlie?

863
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:37,250
Yep, Charlie.
All right then, Charlie. Farewell.

864
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:41,416
You might have babies waiting for you.
Maybe they're waiting for you to come.

865
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,875
Provide for them and don't let them
become dependent on anyone else. Go now!

866
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:49,000
Maybe your wife's waiting for you, too.

867
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,833
Maybe she prepared some bananas
for dinner for your arrival.

868
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:55,333
You'll go, wash your feet
and have dinner. Come on.

869
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:59,541
I know you're in a tough spot.
So am I. I know how you feel.

870
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:02,708
Go, then. Go to your family. Farewell.

871
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,875
Why did you do that, you jerk?
It was a good speech.

872
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:14,208
Why did you do that? You want an answer?
Here's your answer! You imbecile!

873
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,541
I thought you could be a man,
but no! You're anything but man!

874
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:20,958
You jerk! Get out of here!
You stupid gorilla! Get out!

875
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,875
This way. Move!

876
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,500
-I'm so thirsty, Nurullah!
-So am I, Recep!

877
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:49,041
Should we drink each other's urine?

878
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,916
-You can't drink it!
-Yes, you can!

879
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,875
I watched a documentary once.

880
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:56,333
A man survived by drinking his urine.
Maybe we can survive, too.

881
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,750
Nurullah, can you see what I see?

882
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,791
-I can, Recep!
-Is that a village?

883
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,250
There's a village there!

884
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,208
Is that our village, Nurullah?

885
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:09,416
-We made it! We made it, Nurullah!
-We made it, Recep!

886
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,625
Oh, God, we made it!

887
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:13,000
Thank God, we made it, Nurullah!

888
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,875
They have water! I'm so thirsty!

889
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,083
Me, too! Let's get some water!

890
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:19,916
Hello, ladies! Can we have some water?

891
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:26,958
Did I say something wrong? Never mind.
Come on. Let's get some, brother.

892
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,583
Come on, brother. Take some.

893
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:40,250
Here you go. Here, enjoy it.

894
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,333
Recep! Someone's coming.

895
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,625
Hello, brothers.

896
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:59,375
We got lost.
We need to find our way to the town.

897
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,833
We need a telephone.
We need to go to the town,

898
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:04,125
hop on to a plane
and get back to our home.

899
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:09,875
He didn't understand.

900
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:15,416
If we were in a Turkish village right now,
we'd be served flatbread and buttermilk.

901
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:18,750
I'd choose our people any day.
Look at them!

902
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:20,750
Each one's creepier than the other.

903
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:25,416
Look, brother. We are tourists.
Photos, tourists, you know?

904
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:29,125
We're here for safari.
Photos, tourists, you know. Got it?

905
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:33,458
We got off the vehicle. I took a dump.
The vehicle went away. We were left here.

906
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:40,958
What the hell is this?

907
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,750
Oh God! Nurullah,
they're going to cut us into pieces!

908
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,333
Oh, God, help us!
They're going to kill us, Recep!

909
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:53,666
They're going to kill
the shit out of us, Nurullah!

910
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:57,291
Look at him! Hey! The Turkish government
will make you pay for this!

911
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,833
You're making a mistake!
Just let us go, please! We're good people!

912
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:03,125
Shut up, Recep! You're making him angrier!

913
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:06,125
Oh, God! I don't know what he's doing,
man! Just look at him!

914
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:09,916
They're heretics, Recep! Look!
They're worshiping that!

915
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:14,500
Nurullah! That man looks like me!

916
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:18,291
-Yeah, he does, Recep!
-Is he someone special?

917
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:21,666
-He might be since he's up so high!
-I have an idea, Nurullah.

918
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,000
I'll take my chances!

919
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:26,166
If I succeed, we'll be okay.
If I don't, it's "Hakuna Matata".

920
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,708
What the hell does that mean?

921
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,833
It means we're screwed big time.

922
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,375
Enough!

923
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:39,583
Look at that! Come on. Look at it!
Do you see what it is?

924
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,708
Now, look at me.
Look at him first and then me.

925
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,208
See?

926
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:52,791
He's just like me. That's me.

927
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:55,458
Sokachu?

928
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:58,791
-What? What does Sokachu mean?
-It might be his name.

929
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,583
Yeah, his name might be Sokachu.

930
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:02,958
Untie me and I'll show you
how much we look alike.

931
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,333
-Sokachu?
-Yeah, Sokachu. Untie me.

932
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:08,083
Yeah, whatever. Untie me.

933
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,000
Watch this. See?

934
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,708
Do you see now? I'm Sokachu.

935
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,583
Sokachu. I'm Sokachu.

936
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:26,041
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.
That's right. I'm Sokachu.

937
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,625
Yep, that's me. Sokachu.

938
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:31,916
Sokachu!

939
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:37,291
They believe you, Recep. We made it!

940
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,458
I hope so, Nurullah.
Oh, please, stop kneeling.

941
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:44,375
He's lying! He's not Sokachu!

942
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:50,416
No, I am! I'm Sokachu. I've proved it!
Look, it's the same! I'm Sokachu!

943
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,833
No!

944
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:56,916
According to the legend,
Sokachu has an animal!

945
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:01,833
Okay, so do I! Here's my animal!
He's my animal. My private animal.

946
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:05,250
He's a creature with a human's body
and an animal's torso.

947
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,750
-You're being rude!
-Shut up!

948
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:09,791
Rude? We're about to be killed here.
You're an animal.

949
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:12,958
That's how we should trust each other.
I'm relieved. I'm Sokachu.

950
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,375
You're lying!

951
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:23,708
Sokachu can perform miracles.
If you're Sokachu, then prove it.

952
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:26,750
All right, okay. I'll prove it.
Why wouldn't I prove it, huh?

953
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:30,000
Tomorrow! Till the sunset!

954
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,333
Otherwise, you're going to die!

955
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,708
What's happening? Hey!

956
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,750
Hey! Bring my animal! Bring my animal!

957
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,666
Hey!

958
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,291
Hey, easy! Easy!

959
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:46,708
Don't treat us like animals!

960
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,333
Look at us, Nurullah.
We were put into this dump!

961
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:56,791
At least we're alive, thank God.
They almost cut us into pieces.

962
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,208
They will if you don't perform
a miracle by tomorrow.

963
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,291
Shut up. Shut up!

964
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:04,625
Don't drive me crazy!
Get something to eat out of your bag.

965
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:06,875
-It's not here.
-Where is it?

966
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,666
-Where we passed out.
-Why didn't you take it with you?

967
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,250
How could I? I passed out.

968
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:15,083
-For God's sake, man!
-But I have my cellphone and the charger.

969
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:18,333
Then plug it in.
Is there any electricity here, you moron?

970
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:21,583
There's no signal either!
Good for you to take it with you!

971
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:24,708
We'd generate electricity from potatoes
at secondary school.

972
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:27,708
I didn't pay attention.
I quit school after the 3rd grade.

973
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:30,833
After learning how to read and write,
my education was over.

974
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:34,750
That was enough for me. The only thing
I know about potatoes are potato prints.

975
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:38,833
In summer, I used to work with a forger
making fake documents with potato prints.

976
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:40,583
Look around.

977
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:43,833
This place is like a warehouse.
There must be something to eat.

978
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:47,083
-Anything we can eat. Look around.
-Will do, Recep.

979
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:49,291
Here we go.

980
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,750
-Recep, come here.
-What is it?

981
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,791
-There's something to eat.
-Quiet!

982
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:58,083
-Come on!
-Be quiet!

983
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,166
-What is it?
-Look.

984
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:05,625
-What's this?
-We can cook them on the fire!

985
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,791
Are you stupid? We can't eat them.

986
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,500
They're carrier pigeons.

987
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:12,166
Take one of them
and come inside right now. Got it?

988
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,583
Take one and come inside.

989
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:19,958
Come here.

990
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:24,000
Now, this is the bird
that will save our lives, Nurullah.

991
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,250
And you're talking about eating it!

992
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,166
We'll attach a note to its leg
and let it go.

993
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,250
They'll find us thanks to it.

994
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,291
I hope they will.

995
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:36,875
But how are we supposed to write?
I wish we had a pen and a paper.

996
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,750
I have a pen and a paper, Recep.

997
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:41,708
God bless you man! Okay, take them out.

998
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:42,625
-Give me it.
-Here.

999
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,708
Easy, girl. You're okay. It's nothing.

1000
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,875
Don't be afraid, birdie.

1001
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:53,250
Okay. Me, Nurullah the coffeehouse owner
and my friend Recep İvedik got lost.

1002
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:54,708
-We got lost.
-Stop.

1003
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,916
We're in Africa. Stop. Somewhere in Kenya.

1004
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,875
-Somewhere in Kenya.
-Find us. Stop.

1005
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,166
-Stop.
-Help!

1006
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:04,041
-Help.
-Okay.

1007
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,875
Roll it. Come on, roll it.

1008
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:10,916
Attach it to the bird's leg. Come on.

1009
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,250
-Is it done?
-It's done.

1010
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:15,333
All right. Now this bird
will deliver our message

1011
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:17,208
and then they'll find us, Nurullah.

1012
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:20,541
-How will the bird find the address?
-Oh, you're right.

1013
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:24,500
Pigeons find their way by smell.
It needs to smell something familiar.

1014
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:25,583
What are we going to do?

1015
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:28,125
We need to show it
something unique to Güngören.

1016
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:31,000
-I have an idea.
-What is it?

1017
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:33,625
-What do we have most in our neighborhood?
-I don't know.

1018
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:36,291
What does your wife hang?
She shoos away the birds

1019
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,416
-to prevent them pooing on what?
-Clothes.

1020
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,750
Yes, clothes,
but more importantly, your underwear.

1021
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:45,166
The neighborhood's full of your underwear
just like you're wearing.

1022
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:49,125
If we let the bird smell it,
it'll find your underwear at home.

1023
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:51,083
-Take off your underwear.
-No way.

1024
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,625
-Take it off!
-Definitely not!

1025
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:54,916
It's a matter of life and death!
Take it off!

1026
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,541
Take it off and bring it. I'm not
interested in your dirty underwear!

1027
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,708
Do it somewhere secluded.
Goddamn it, what a body!

1028
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,875
Go, go. Go, quickly!
Okay, give me the underwear.

1029
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:12,958
Give me it. Goddamn you, what underwear!

1030
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,083
Smell it girl.
Come on, smell the underwear.

1031
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,958
You'll find headquarters.

1032
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,458
You'll go to Güngören
and deliver our message.

1033
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:23,041
Come on, smell it. Smell the underwear.

1034
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,250
Okay, take it!

1035
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:29,083
Okay, now go and deliver our message.
Give us our freedom!

1036
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:32,583
I'm praying to God
and sending you now. Now, go!

1037
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:41,166
Great! The bird died
because of your dirty underwear!

1038
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:44,541
Its lungs were ruined.
It couldn't cope with the smell.

1039
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,375
Hello!

1040
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,250
-Someone's here.
-Hello!

1041
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,791
Hello.

1042
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,583
Hello, brother.

1043
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,625
We have time till tomorrow.
Why are you here?

1044
01:01:57,708 --> 01:02:01,291
Guys, I've brought you something to eat.

1045
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:04,750
Thank you. You should've brought
something to drink, too.

1046
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,958
We're about to die of thirst.

1047
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:08,875
Thank you so much.

1048
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:14,416
I believe you. You're Sokachu.
Prove it to my father. Perform a miracle.

1049
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:16,958
-Your father?
-My father's the chief.

1050
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:18,625
-Your father is the Chief?
-Yes.

1051
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:22,541
Then would you talk to your father
about letting us go? We're good people.

1052
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:25,541
He'll let you go,
but first you need to perform a miracle.

1053
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:29,750
Go on! Convince him to let us go.
Go on, man, for your necklace's sake!

1054
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,166
Talk to him and convince him to let us go.

1055
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,125
-Let me tell you something.
-What?

1056
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,000
Just eat. Come on. Eat it.

1057
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:41,250
Goddamn you!

1058
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:44,208
Just eat!
Thank you, we didn't know that! Idiot!

1059
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:48,625
Stupid rich boy. He's got money
and everything else, but no brain!

1060
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:58,458
Recep, what are you doing?
Why are you making a noise?

1061
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,500
-Shut up, you idiot!
-What's that?

1062
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:05,041
I've made a charger
for that useless phone of yours!

1063
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:07,333
I've even attached
electric coils behind it.

1064
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,458
It's called knowledge
of math and mechanics!

1065
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:11,625
Give me the phone.

1066
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:14,916
Take a seat, come on! Quick!

1067
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,333
Wait for my signal. Don't touch it. Don't!

1068
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:22,333
You got it? It's a mechanical device.

1069
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:25,416
Okay, now spin it.

1070
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:29,500
Come on, spin the wheels. Spin faster!

1071
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:30,791
It's all I can do!

1072
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:32,500
Come on, Spin it! Faster!

1073
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,708
It's not working. Stop!

1074
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:36,625
Here, hold it.

1075
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,666
Should I do it myself?
Should I do the spinning myself?

1076
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,791
Am I supposed to invent it and spin it?

1077
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,750
-Are you trying to kill me?
-Shut up!

1078
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:47,166
Shut up!

1079
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:50,000
-I can't do it, man.
-Shut up!

1080
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,000
-Listen to me.
-What?

1081
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,958
-Let me know when we have electricity.
-Got it.

1082
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,166
-Then I can adjust the voltage.
-Okay.

1083
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,375
-You got it?
-Got it.

1084
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,333
-Don't make me spin it for nothing.
-Okay.

1085
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:02,625
Okay, here we go.

1086
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:03,875
More power to my elbow!

1087
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:05,083
I'm starting.

1088
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,750
-Hit it.
-Here we go.

1089
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,750
Spin it, man! Come on!

1090
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,583
Do we have any electricity?

1091
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:14,041
-No, man.
-Don't we have any yet?

1092
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,708
-Keep spinning Recep. Come on!
-Anything yet?

1093
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,916
Now we have it! The phone's charging now!

1094
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,500
-I'm increasing the voltage!
-Keep going, man!

1095
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:24,791
-I'm trying man! I'm getting tired!
-Don't stop! Come on!

1096
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,541
-Come on Recep!
-Is the phone on?

1097
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,833
Almost there man, keep going!

1098
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:31,000
What a crap phone! Why isn't it working?

1099
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,375
It's on now, man!

1100
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,708
Send a message
to the first number you see!

1101
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:37,833
-A message from the embassy.
-Send our location to the embassy!

1102
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,958
-I'm sending the location.
-Send it right now, Nurullah!

1103
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,250
I'm sending it, buddy!

1104
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:45,291
Oh, something's happened!
It's malfunctioning!

1105
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:48,458
-Goddamn it, man! What happened?
-It's out of my control, man!

1106
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:51,208
-Damn, the camera is on now!
-Why the camera?

1107
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:53,958
-Something happened to the phone!
-Why did turn it on?

1108
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:55,166
It's out of my control!

1109
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,208
-Did you send it?
-It's taking photos by itself!

1110
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,583
Send it!

1111
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:00,166
-Send it!
-Damn!

1112
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,208
I've sent something but I don't know what.

1113
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:04,666
-The screen is frozen!
-I said send it!

1114
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,083
-Send it!
-Damn it!

1115
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,416
Oh, I can't hold the phone, man! Oh, crap!

1116
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:12,166
-What are you doing?
-I can't hold it. It's too hot!

1117
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,000
Screw you and your phone!

1118
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,125
REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
THE CONSULATE GENERAL OF KENYA

1119
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,791
I didn't expect it from you, Ersin.

1120
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:22,708
How could you leave
Turkish citizens alone in the jungle?

1121
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:24,375
It happened the way I told you.

1122
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:30,208
Sir, we found these clothes and this bag.
They must belong to them.

1123
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:33,708
The bag belongs to them.
The short guy carried it all the time.

1124
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:36,708
They set up a camp
near the west border of the Savanna.

1125
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,375
-We found these there.
-So they might be alive.

1126
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,041
I hope they are.

1127
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,583
Sir, they probably know
about survival in the wild.

1128
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,875
Sir.

1129
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:50,250
-I have good news, sir.
-What is it?

1130
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:51,916
We received some messages last night.

1131
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:55,208
The signal was received
from a forest near Uganda,

1132
01:05:55,291 --> 01:06:00,125
at the west side of Kenya.

1133
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:02,875
We're trying to pinpoint
the exact location right now.

1134
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,875
They're alive.

1135
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,375
Let go of me!

1136
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:33,875
You! Perform a miracle,
or you're going to die.

1137
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:39,583
Damn, man! Why are you so angry?

1138
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,708
I told you I'd do it, didn't I?

1139
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,833
And I will. Tell them to stay down.
I'll perform any miracle you want.

1140
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,458
What are you going to do?

1141
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:51,291
I'm going to show them some tricks
I learned at primary school.

1142
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:54,958
They might not know them since
they live here. I think they'll buy it.

1143
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,166
Let's start, shall we?

1144
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:02,916
Watch this. Look at my fingers.
Watch carefully.

1145
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:11,625
-See? How about that?
-It's not a miracle!

1146
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:14,708
Both my hands are in my pockets.

1147
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,833
-How about that?
-What's this?

1148
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,250
Here's another one. Are you watching?

1149
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:32,875
Perform a miracle!

1150
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:36,791
Chief, I'm going to disappear
behind this cloth suddenly.

1151
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:40,041
Do you know how it's possible?
Because it's a miracle. Watch this.

1152
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,125
One.

1153
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:43,625
Two.

1154
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:45,583
Three.

1155
01:07:56,458 --> 01:08:01,541
I haven't met him before.
Do I know you? No.

1156
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:05,666
And he doesn't speak our language.
Watch this carefully. It'll be a miracle.

1157
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:16,875
Oh, an egg! Where did it come from?
Oh! How did it come out of his head?

1158
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:20,125
Choose one of the tricks!

1159
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,791
Get ready for the miracle.
Lift it. Come on.

1160
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,833
Are you watching carefully?

1161
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:38,708
Why did you drop it?
Did I tell you to drop it?

1162
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,000
You jerks! Did I tell you to drop it?

1163
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,250
You ready? Watch this.

1164
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,416
What? You didn't like it?
What's happening?

1165
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:56,833
You're going to die if there's no miracle.

1166
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,958
Come on, Chief, show us some mercy.

1167
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:05,791
I've performed many miracles and you won't
accept any of them. It's not fair!

1168
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:10,375
What did you tell me yesterday?
You said we have till tomorrow at sunset.

1169
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:13,750
It's not over yet.
The sun's still in the sky.

1170
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:18,333
You gave me your word. What kind of a man
would you be if you didn't keep your word?

1171
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:19,916
Be a man of your word.

1172
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I've still got time to perform a miracle,
don't I?

1173
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,291
Stop saying that we're going to die.

1174
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,750
-Be patient.
-What are you going to do?

1175
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:31,375
I have an idea.
Do you see that stooping man?

1176
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,291
-Yeah.
-I'll help him straighten up

1177
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:34,625
using Mehmet's technique.

1178
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:35,708
At least I'll try.

1179
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:39,791
Chief, I'm going to perform
a miracle for you now, okay?

1180
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:44,000
But I need someone.
I need him. Come here. Come on.

1181
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:51,208
Good. This guy is stooping. Like this.
And I'll help him straighten up, okay?

1182
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:53,083
What's he doing here? Is he a sorcerer?

1183
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:56,791
I'll help the sorcerer straighten up.
Do you accept the miracle or not?

1184
01:09:56,875 --> 01:10:00,916
-No, don't let him do it.
-Shut up!

1185
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:03,166
Don't stick your nose into everything!

1186
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,625
Chief, don't let them talk like that.
You're the Chief, use your influence.

1187
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:07,958
Will you accept it?

1188
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:11,125
Will you accept it as a miracle
if he straightens up?

1189
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:14,041
Okay. This is your last chance.

1190
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:19,416
Okay Chief. I'm here to perform a miracle
to prove that I'm Sokachu.

1191
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,958
As you can see,
this guy's a seasoned sorcerer.

1192
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,958
Are you alright? Are you?
See the way he's breathing?

1193
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:30,833
He's breathing like a horse!
He's in pain and I'll relieve his pain.

1194
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:34,375
Lay down. Come on.
All right. Watch this carefully, Chief.

1195
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:37,375
Pull, pull him up!
Okay, stabilize the rope.

1196
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,958
Stabilize it. All right. Chief, this guy
has a slipped disk in his lower back.

1197
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:46,000
There's a compression between the disks
and I'll treat him.

1198
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:50,625
I'm going to use gravitational pull,
discovered by Newton. Now, he's hanged.

1199
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:54,625
Easy. Relax.

1200
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,416
All right, great.

1201
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,333
All right, I'll help him
straighten up using this.

1202
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:02,083
Are you ready?
Okay, one two, three. Here we go.

1203
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:04,166
I hope your technique works, Mehmet.

1204
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:09,625
Now, from here.
And I'm going to pull him a little bit.

1205
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:16,166
All right, pull him down.

1206
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,666
All right, get up. Stand up.

1207
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:23,958
Oh, hey, stand up now. How is your back?
Are you feeling better?

1208
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:27,333
Aren't you feeling better?
One, two, three. Here we go.

1209
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,958
All right.

1210
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,416
How are you now?

1211
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:43,458
Sokachu!

1212
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,166
-Sokachu!
-Did you see that?

1213
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:52,708
We did it! We did it, man!
That's how it's done!

1214
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:56,708
Sokachu! Sokachu!

1215
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:22,541
You! Sokachu!

1216
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:29,958
Welcome to the Nahu Tribe,
your homeland and your first home!

1217
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,958
This necklace is the necklace for bravery.

1218
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:39,875
Keep it
and don't let anyone take it from you.

1219
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,416
A cheap necklace. Made of tin.

1220
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:53,583
This helmet will show your strength.
From now on, you're one of us.

1221
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:56,416
Welcome aboard!

1222
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,166
Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu!

1223
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:04,208
Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu!

1224
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:22,208
Goddamn you! What the hell is this for?
What the hell is the spitting for, huh?

1225
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:25,875
Goddamn all of you! It's unacceptable.

1226
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:27,458
No! Don't you dare!

1227
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:31,166
No! Get out of here! Get out!

1228
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:34,958
I'm Sokachu
and I'm constantly being spat in the face!

1229
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,708
Dude, spitting is a demonstration
of affection for us.

1230
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:40,166
It's a kind of welcome.

1231
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,583
What kind of welcome is that?
Screw being Sokachu!

1232
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:47,958
It's unacceptable! As Sokachu,
from this moment on I'm banning spitting!

1233
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:50,583
It's my first action as Sokachu!
No more spitting!

1234
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:22,583
Take it and eat it. It's nice.

1235
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:25,666
No, thank you. I'm not hungry, thanks.

1236
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,791
No, you should.
This is sacred food. It's good. Eat it.

1237
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:31,291
Oh, dear God. What's this?

1238
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:32,916
It's great food. Eat it.

1239
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,708
I'll trust you on this.

1240
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:37,791
Let's taste it. It'd be rude not to.

1241
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:39,458
Okay, here we go.

1242
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:45,375
Oh, I know what it is. I know it.
Here. Have some.

1243
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:48,708
Eat it and you'll know what it is. I know.

1244
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,666
Its name is on the tip of my tongue.
What is it?

1245
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:55,208
-It's rhino.
-Yeah, I knew it. It's rhino.

1246
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,125
I knew it was rhino.

1247
01:14:57,208 --> 01:15:01,125
I was about to say that. I was going
to say it's an ethnic animal, a rhino.

1248
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:02,541
It tastes like rhino meat.

1249
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,875
An ethnic taste, you know. A rhino. Good.

1250
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:09,583
-What is it? Rhino steak or something?
-It's the rhino's organ.

1251
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:12,000
Which organ? An internal one?

1252
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:14,250
Rhino's big organ.

1253
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:19,291
-Is it rib steak?
-It's rhino penis.

1254
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:24,791
-Penis?
-Yeah, rhino penis.

1255
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:25,875
The rhino's...?

1256
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,541
-Yeah, it's good. Eat.
-It's good.

1257
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:32,083
Goddamn all of you!
Goddamn you all! Take it!

1258
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:35,125
Screw being Sokachu! Give me a drink.

1259
01:15:35,208 --> 01:15:38,875
It got stuck. The rhino's penis
got stuck in my throat. Give it to me!

1260
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:47,375
I swear I'm about to throw up.
This is so good. What's this?

1261
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,250
It's ugamba mugamba.

1262
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:51,125
Yeah, ugamba mugamba? What's that?

1263
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:52,916
Ugamba means white bat.

1264
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:56,708
So you named the drink white bat. Cool.

1265
01:15:56,791 --> 01:16:03,000
No, it's ugamba mugamba. Ugamba means
white bat and mugamba means piss.

1266
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,875
So, it means white bat's piss.
It's good for your health.

1267
01:16:06,958 --> 01:16:10,875
Goddamn you all!
Take it! What kind of people are you?

1268
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,458
There are other animal parts, you know,
other than rhino penis and bat's piss!

1269
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,708
Give me some fruit so I can forget it!

1270
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:21,166
I'm going to eat fruit only, nothing else!

1271
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,625
-Fruit only!
-Yeah, fruit!

1272
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,708
That's how it started.

1273
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:37,166
We were going to go to Konya,
but ended up here.

1274
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,416
Here's the result. Do we look alike?

1275
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,000
-Do we?
-Hey, hey, hey!

1276
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:44,708
What are you doing?

1277
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:46,833
You scared me! What are you doing here?

1278
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:50,333
Let's get out of here,
since they believe that you're Sokachu.

1279
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:54,083
Yeah, let's go and fall prey to lions
and other animals!

1280
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,125
-Now we need to stay here!
-Why is that?

1281
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:59,291
-Didn't you send the messages?
-I did.

1282
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:02,541
If the messages were delivered
to the right people,

1283
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:04,958
they'll pinpoint our location with GSM.

1284
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:09,291
They'll find our location.
We need to stay here so they can find us.

1285
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,875
-You're right, man.
-We can't go anywhere, Nurullah.

1286
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:14,291
You got it, man.

1287
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,208
By the way, I need to pee right now.

1288
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,750
Stay here. I'm going for a pee.

1289
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:19,791
Be careful.

1290
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:23,541
I can't wait anymore, Zouya.
When will you talk to your father?

1291
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:27,791
I can't talk to him, Songa. He says
I can't marry a man from the Nahu Tribe.

1292
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,166
-Then I'll talk to him.
-No, Songa.

1293
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,666
My father will kill you.

1294
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,208
-I love you.
-What's happening?

1295
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,583
-Who's there?
-I can't wait.

1296
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,666
And I love you too, Songa.

1297
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:44,791
Hey! Songa!

1298
01:17:45,416 --> 01:17:47,250
What's happening? Who's that girl?

1299
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:49,166
-Nobody's here.
-Cut the bullshit.

1300
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,583
I saw her with my own eyes.

1301
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,083
Did you take her behind the fence
to make love? You're the man!

1302
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:55,750
She's my girlfriend, man.

1303
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,916
-So you're not fooling around?
-No, man.

1304
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:00,166
Oh, now I understand.

1305
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,458
-Who is she?
-She's one of the Hunkutus.

1306
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:03,458
Who are they?

1307
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:05,208
Our enemies.

1308
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:09,000
-Why are you with her then?
-I love her, man. I'm in love with her.

1309
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:13,625
You got me when you said love.
You're lovesick.

1310
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:16,166
I know how you feel.

1311
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,208
All right, but don't tell anyone
about this. Anyone at all!

1312
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:21,625
My lips are sealed.

1313
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:22,958
All right, I trust you.

1314
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:25,625
Don't worry. It's our little secret.

1315
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:31,791
No! No! I said no!
A Nahu can't marry a Hunkutu, Songa!

1316
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:35,166
Thanks for keeping the secret!
Now I'm finished!

1317
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,250
I did nothing. Did I tweet about it?

1318
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,125
Did I share it on Instagram?

1319
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:42,583
-I did nothing!
-Hunkutus are my enemies!

1320
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,500
This marriage won't happen
as long as I'm alive! Never!

1321
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:48,625
What I can do, Father? I love her.

1322
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:51,500
-Let's go and make peace.
-Shut up! I said shut up!

1323
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:55,000
It's over!

1324
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:59,958
-Damn it, Father!
-Don't disrespect your father.

1325
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:04,833
You're getting on his nerves.
You don't say damn it to your father.

1326
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:09,166
I told you if my father knew, it would be
impossible for us to be together.

1327
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,958
You screwed me over, man!

1328
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:15,125
All right, all right. Stop whining.
Do you really love her?

1329
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:18,500
-Stop it, man!
-Do you love her or not?

1330
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,250
-I'm crazy for her.
-If you're crazy for her,

1331
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:24,625
we'll go to her father
and ask permission for marriage.

1332
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:27,875
If he agrees, cool. If he doesn't,
we'll make her run away with you.

1333
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:29,000
But how?

1334
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:32,666
We'll do a cross-border operation.
Take your best man with you.

1335
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,791
And I'll take my humanoid animal with me.

1336
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:37,500
We'll go to the Hunkutu village
at the crack of dawn.

1337
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:38,666
Got it, man.

1338
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,041
My name's Sokachu.
I won't let lovers get separated!

1339
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:44,583
-All right, man.
-Whatever it takes, I'll get it done!

1340
01:19:44,666 --> 01:19:45,875
-Got it?
-Got it.

1341
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:58,833
Gentlemen, the infiltration is successful.
You stay here.

1342
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:00,000
You'll be on watch.

1343
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,875
If we don't come back,
go to the village and let them know.

1344
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:03,791
-Okay.
-You.

1345
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:07,208
You go first and find the tent, Songa.
Okay? And you'll follow him.

1346
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:09,458
-All right.
-Okay, good luck gentlemen.

1347
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:13,416
Let's start the infiltration.
Nice and slow. Crouch. Move.

1348
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,916
You little bastards.
All right, keep moving!

1349
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:04,666
Okay. The infiltration
is successful, gentlemen.

1350
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:09,333
-Now we need to find the right tent.
-I don't know which one, man.

1351
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:11,583
-How could you not know?
-I don't know.

1352
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:14,958
Hey! Hey! Back off!

1353
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:17,625
-Come on, which tent?
-I don't know.

1354
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:21,458
-I was attacked before you found the tent!
-I think she lives in a big tent.

1355
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:26,166
I think so, too. So, let's try that one.
All right, infiltration number two.

1356
01:21:44,791 --> 01:21:46,625
Oh, look who it is.

1357
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:55,041
We're so sorry. We entered by mistake.
We're looking for a woman. We're sorry.

1358
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:02,458
You broke into my house!

1359
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:04,125
Nahus!

1360
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:05,791
Nahus!

1361
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:09,708
I'm going to kill you!

1362
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:14,291
Look, pal, we didn't break in
intentionally. It was a mistake.

1363
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:15,958
How could we know you were inside?

1364
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:18,541
We wouldn't have broken in
if we'd known, believe me.

1365
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:21,041
We wouldn't break in
to see your shitty face!

1366
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:25,250
You're disgusting.
Look, stop talking about killing us.

1367
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:27,291
Don't talk about it or you'll be sorry.

1368
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,750
This guy's the chief's son.
He's Songa, the chief's son.

1369
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:36,000
Don't even dare to touch us,
or I'll bring thousands of men here!

1370
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:39,125
Be smart. Don't lay a finger on us.

1371
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,750
We're not alone!
What do you think we are, huh?

1372
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,791
Here they come! What happened?

1373
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:47,750
You seem surprised!
Now the shoe is on the other foot!

1374
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:51,833
Easy!

1375
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,958
Oh, what happened?
Why did you stop ranting and raving?

1376
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:57,875
See? They're brave and they're here.

1377
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,500
We're Nahu. We're the people
you shouldn't mess with. Got it?

1378
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:02,791
Watch your step!

1379
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,583
-What's going on here?
-We came here for a good cause, Chief,

1380
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:10,500
but we were mistreated.
Don't worry, though. I'll talk to them.

1381
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:15,458
Okay. Chief of the Hunkutu, listen to me.

1382
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:20,250
My name's Sokachu.
Sokachu of Nahu. Come here.

1383
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,666
And this is my animal, my humanoid animal.
I stand where I am now for nothing.

1384
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:30,166
I stand here thanks to a legend.
Behave yourselves! Now, move back.

1385
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:36,041
Me and my tribe have come
to you for a good cause.

1386
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:43,333
By God's will, we want to marry our son,
Songa, with your daughter...

1387
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:44,833
-What's her name?
-Zouya.

1388
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:46,416
Yeah, with your daughter Ziya.

1389
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:48,708
-Do you agree or not?
-Zouya!

1390
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:50,416
Father.

1391
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,541
I won't let her to marry any Nahu man!

1392
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:11,291
-Why?
-Nahus are cowards!

1393
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:12,833
Nahus are brave!

1394
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,875
Stop shouting!
You're giving me a headache!

1395
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:21,125
First he shouts, then you!
Let's talk nicely.

1396
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,875
-Sokachu, let's go.
-Wait a minute, Chief.

1397
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,125
I'm going to solve this problem!

1398
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,916
Since you think Nahus are cowards
and Hunkutus are brave...

1399
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:34,041
and since you think
we don't know how to fight

1400
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:36,625
and you're good fighters,
then let's take it to the ring.

1401
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,583
Do you have the balls for it?

1402
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:43,916
I'm challenging you, loud and clear,
Nahus versus Hunkutus.

1403
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,166
Are you for or against it? Do you agree?

1404
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:50,625
-Deal! But with one condition.
-What is it?

1405
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:55,541
If we win, you'll forget about the girl

1406
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:58,208
and that necklace will be mine.

1407
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:01,541
No, Sokachu! That necklace belongs to us!

1408
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:06,375
It's belonged to us for 200 years.
It's called the Soul of Jungle.

1409
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:11,041
It's a cheap one, man. It's made of tin.
You think it's valuable, but it's not.

1410
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:13,458
See? It's fake.
I know a guy in the Grand Bazaar.

1411
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:17,375
I'll get him to make another one
and send it to you. Just calm down. Relax.

1412
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:22,125
All right, deal! If you win,
the necklace will be yours.

1413
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:25,208
But if we win, we'll take...
What's her name again?

1414
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:28,333
-It's Zouya.
-We'll take Soya and go. Deal?

1415
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:29,333
Deal!

1416
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:32,416
Then I'll wait for all of you
to come to the grassland

1417
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,666
in front of the village tomorrow.

1418
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,875
See you tomorrow!
Behave yourselves! Let's go.

1419
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:45,500
All right, today's the day.

1420
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:51,583
It's the moment of truth.
From now on, we'll have to sink or swim.

1421
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:57,625
This isn't about Songa's love or marriage.
We've passed that point.

1422
01:25:58,166 --> 01:26:03,708
This is a matter of pride and honor now.

1423
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,916
We'll show them
what a true Nahu is made of!

1424
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:14,000
We'll show them our strength,
our courage and our fighting skills!

1425
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:20,375
With God's will, we'll fight
to the last drop of our blood and sweat!

1426
01:26:20,458 --> 01:26:23,083
We'll plant our flag in their village
and return.

1427
01:26:23,166 --> 01:26:26,375
Dude, we don't have a flag.

1428
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:31,333
Oh, really? That's what you think, Songa.
Nurullah, show them.

1429
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:35,916
From this moment on, this is our flag.

1430
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:38,833
It's the "nah" gesture.

1431
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:42,583
And your tribe is called Nahu.
You can't get a better flag than this one.

1432
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:46,416
Let me show you how it's done.
Make a fist and then do this.

1433
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:48,750
Let's try it.

1434
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:52,083
Yeah, good. All right, try it.

1435
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,583
Okay, good. Good.

1436
01:26:55,458 --> 01:27:00,166
You'll get better at it. At first, it was
hard for me, too. You'll get better.

1437
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,375
-Who are we?
-Nahu!

1438
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:02,458
-Who are we?
-Nahu!

1439
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,041
-Nahu!
-Nahu! Nahu! Nahu!

1440
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:11,125
-Let the games begin!
-Let them begin!

1441
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:20,833
-The first game is the slapping game!
-Let's see who's stronger!

1442
01:27:28,166 --> 01:27:29,250
Goddamn you!

1443
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:31,666
Come on, Songa! Come on!

1444
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,041
Damn it!

1445
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:40,625
Oh dear God!

1446
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:46,916
Come on, Nurullah! Go get him!
Show him what a Turk is made of!

1447
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:51,208
Good. Now, slap him!

1448
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:54,875
Goddamn you!

1449
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:00,791
You couldn't even touch him!

1450
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:02,916
Look at us, outnumbered again.

1451
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,958
All right, here we go.

1452
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,458
Hello, brother.

1453
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,541
You get it? Huh? Come on.

1454
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:22,500
Are you ready? Hit me! Hit me!

1455
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:27,666
Good.

1456
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:30,000
You're tough. You hit hard.

1457
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:33,333
But now you're getting a slap of
Ottoman-Nahu mix. Are you ready for it?

1458
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:34,708
Watch carefully.

1459
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:46,583
Nahu!

1460
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,208
Nahu!

1461
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:52,541
You didn't last long!

1462
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:08,333
-That's how it's done!
-Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu!

1463
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,291
Sokachu! Sokachu!

1464
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:18,500
The next game is walking on fire!
Let it begin!

1465
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:24,708
They've been walking on fire
since they were born? Look at them.

1466
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:27,208
They chose this game
so that you can't win.

1467
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:30,375
I know that,
but I'm not going to fall for it.

1468
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:33,875
I'm prepared in every way,
legal or illegal, Nurullah.

1469
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:35,750
Apply the mix to my feet I told you about.

1470
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:39,500
-Do you think it'll work?
-It will. I saw it in a documentary.

1471
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,750
It'll create a layer of air
beneath my feet.

1472
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,833
And that layer will block the fire.

1473
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:46,083
I'll pretend to stretch my legs. Apply it.

1474
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,333
-Is it done?
-It's done.

1475
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:58,583
Sokachu! Sokachu! It's your turn!

1476
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:02,250
Wait, I'm stretching my legs.
Did you apply it?

1477
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:04,458
-It's done.
-It is?

1478
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:07,708
Here we go.

1479
01:30:14,125 --> 01:30:15,041
Here we go.

1480
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:20,083
Oh my God! Nurullah!

1481
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:22,541
-What happened, Recep?
-My feet got stuck!

1482
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:25,333
They're getting burnt! Oh my God!

1483
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:39,416
Pull! Pull it! What are you doing?

1484
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:43,791
Stop it! Stop it and get out of here!
Get out of here! I don't need any of you!

1485
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:54,166
I made it! That's how it's done!

1486
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:04,000
Oh God! I'm slipping!
How can you stand still like that?

1487
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,208
I'm running out of energy!

1488
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,750
-I'm out of energy!
-No!

1489
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:10,916
Here we go!

1490
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,041
Goddamn it!

1491
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:24,041
Goddamn you!

1492
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:28,833
Hunkutu won't accept a tie!

1493
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:30,583
Hunkutu is brave!

1494
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:34,000
Marok the lord of the jungle
will break this tie!

1495
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:37,416
-Marok! Marok!
-Nahu?

1496
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,791
Do you have the guts?

1497
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,500
Nahus fear nothing!

1498
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:48,875
-We accept Marok as the tie breaker!
-Marok!

1499
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:53,750
-Hey, tell me, what's Marok?
-The biggest snake in the jungle.

1500
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:56,416
-An anaconda.
-Anaconda?

1501
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,708
Yes, Sokachu, an anaconda.

1502
01:31:58,791 --> 01:32:02,291
Nobody trying to take its eggs
has ever survived.

1503
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:05,750
No, Chief, don't accept. Don't accept it.

1504
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:09,500
All right. Who will go for the Hunkutus?

1505
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:12,541
-Tukumba!
-Tukumba!

1506
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:14,291
Who is the Nahu contestant?

1507
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:16,125
Sokachu will do it.

1508
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:19,208
Why me, you idiot?
Do I have to do everything? Why me again?

1509
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,333
I won't do it. Save your own skins.

1510
01:32:21,416 --> 01:32:25,291
Sokachu can't do everything himself.
It's the anaconda, Chief. I can't do it.

1511
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:28,416
I can barely dealing with all the cobras.
I'm not up to it.

1512
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:32,500
-Sokachu!
-Sokachu!

1513
01:32:32,583 --> 01:32:33,916
Sokachu will go for it!

1514
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:38,208
The bravest men
from both villages will go...

1515
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:44,291
and bring the eggs of Marok back
before sunset.

1516
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:47,541
The one who bring the eggs first wins.

1517
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:50,458
Deal! Hunkutus will win!

1518
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:53,041
Hunkutu! Hunkutu! Hunkutu!

1519
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:57,791
-Nahus will win!
-Nahu! Nahu! Nahu!

1520
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:06,000
Hey, Songa. Where is this Marok?

1521
01:33:06,416 --> 01:33:08,708
Be careful, dude. It might be anywhere.

1522
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:12,458
As far as I know, snakes live
under rocks or logs, in calm places.

1523
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:14,916
It's a very big snake, dude! Anaconda!

1524
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,583
Should we look by the riverside?

1525
01:33:16,666 --> 01:33:19,416
What riverside are you talking about?
We're in a jungle!

1526
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,625
Oh God, it's Marok!

1527
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,416
I'm kidding.

1528
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,875
What's that? Holy crap!

1529
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:35,250
-Are those Marok's eggs?
-Yeah. They're very big.

1530
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:37,916
Damn! They have
the size of Nurullah's head!

1531
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:40,583
I wonder how big the animal itself is.

1532
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:42,625
It's a great snake man, an anaconda.

1533
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:44,375
-Nurullah?
-What, bro?

1534
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:46,625
-Do you see those eggs?
-I do.

1535
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:49,541
-Go get one of them. Come on.
-I can't.

1536
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:53,208
I want to hit you now!
Why are you here? You're useless!

1537
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:56,333
-Come on Songa.
-I can't do it, man.

1538
01:33:56,916 --> 01:33:59,875
Goddamn you two! Why did you come with me?

1539
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:02,666
To see the jungle?
Do I have to do everything myself?

1540
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:04,750
Give it to me!

1541
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,958
Listen to me. I'm going over there now.

1542
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:11,708
If you detect any danger,
you'll rush to help me.

1543
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:12,750
-Got it.
-Got it?

1544
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:14,833
-Got it, Recep.
-Don't leave me alone.

1545
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:16,833
-You got it, buddy.
-It's critical.

1546
01:34:16,916 --> 01:34:19,750
You'll come to help me
as soon as you detect any danger.

1547
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:20,750
-Okay.
-Promise?

1548
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:22,291
-Promise.
-You have my word.

1549
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:23,208
Here we go.

1550
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:30,458
-It's not here, guys.
-Come on, man! Take the eggs!

1551
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:32,250
Take the eggs, buddy!

1552
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:35,291
It's not here. The snake's not here.

1553
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:38,666
Dude, it might be anywhere!
It's too dangerous. Come on!

1554
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:42,083
Nurullah! Look at the eggs, man!

1555
01:34:42,541 --> 01:34:45,666
-Come on dude! Just take them!
-Take a look, Nurullah.

1556
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,666
I mean, it's perfect for...

1557
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:52,041
an omelet with butter. Think about it.

1558
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:54,916
It's in a pan and you can dip
the bread into the omelet.

1559
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:58,416
-It's perfect for omelet.
-Forget the omelet!

1560
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:02,750
No need to be afraid. Stop exaggerating.
It left its eggs here and went away.

1561
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,291
Who knows where it is now?

1562
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:07,625
It might be after other snakes to do it...
You get the point. It's gone.

1563
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:10,000
Take the eggs, man! It's no joke!

1564
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:13,291
It probably uses the place as a cathouse.
It's not its home.

1565
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,375
-It drops by now and then.
-It's a nest! Come on!

1566
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:19,916
I heard something.

1567
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,750
-Get back, please!
-I hear something.

1568
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:24,416
Come on! Get back here!

1569
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,291
-Marok.
-Get back with the eggs!

1570
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:28,791
-It's no joke, man!
-Marok, come here, boy.

1571
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:30,500
-Come on!
-It's not here.

1572
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:35,958
-Oh my God!
-Don't just stand there! Help me!

1573
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:46,750
Hey! I said help me! Help! Help! Help me!

1574
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,833
-Oh my God!
-Dear God, help him!

1575
01:35:56,916 --> 01:35:59,666
-Oh my God!
-Come here and help me!

1576
01:36:03,416 --> 01:36:05,083
-It's taking him!
-Help me!

1577
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:06,875
I said help me!

1578
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:08,541
-Buddy!
-Help!

1579
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:09,916
It's taking him inside!

1580
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:17,416
Run, quick!

1581
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:37,458
Songa!

1582
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:39,416
Where's Sokachu?

1583
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:43,166
Father, we found the eggs,
but Marok attacked us.

1584
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:47,166
It took Sokachu into its nest.
We couldn't save him. He's gone!

1585
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:50,750
Is he dead?

1586
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:54,458
It took him into its nest!
We couldn't stop it!

1587
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:56,000
Damn it, Sokachu!

1588
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:02,041
Forgive me Zouya! I will always love you!

1589
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:06,416
The Nahu warrior is absent.

1590
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:09,166
The Hunkutu has brought an egg.

1591
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:12,250
The winner is Hunku...

1592
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:14,500
Sokachu!

1593
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:26,375
Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu!

1594
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:31,916
Sokachu! Sokachu!

1595
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,666
-Sokachu! Sokachu!
-Move away!

1596
01:37:40,583 --> 01:37:44,166
You asked for its eggs and
here's Marok itself, gentlemen.

1597
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:48,041
I've brought some of its eggs, too,
in case you need them.

1598
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:50,500
You can make omelets with them.

1599
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:54,458
So, the winner is Nahu!

1600
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:03,291
So, Hunkutu Chief,
I've done what I had to.

1601
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:06,708
Now it's your turn. Let's see
if you give permission for the marriage.

1602
01:38:08,166 --> 01:38:10,500
Hunkutus are true to their word.
Sokachu has won.

1603
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,666
Zouya is allowed to marry.

1604
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:17,250
You need to say my daughter Ziya
is allowed to marry Songa of Nahu.

1605
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:18,333
Let's hear it.

1606
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:24,458
-She's allowed to marry Songa of Nahu.
-That's what I'm talking about!

1607
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:30,875
Let's have the wedding ceremony tomorrow
if both the chiefs agree. What do you say?

1608
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:31,875
-I agree.
-And you?

1609
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:32,791
I do, too.

1610
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:36,125
You're all invited to the wedding
in Nahu village tomorrow!

1611
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:43,291
Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu!

1612
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:07,875
Isn't the foam too much?

1613
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:10,583
No, it's perfect.
That's how you shave a groom.

1614
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:28,416
And it's done!

1615
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:49,625
What's this?

1616
01:39:50,625 --> 01:39:51,458
What's this?

1617
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:55,625
You can't play with it! It says dynamite!
Get out of here! Get out!

1618
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:58,958
It's unacceptable!
What kind of bullshit is this?

1619
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:02,375
Oh my God! Oh, dear God!

1620
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:09,041
Where should I throw it?
It's about to explode! Damn!

1621
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,958
It's going to explode in my hand!

1622
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:13,833
Nurullah! It's going to explode
in my hand! Oh God!

1623
01:40:24,291 --> 01:40:27,458
It was the only thing that hadn't
exploded in my ass, dynamite!

1624
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:29,916
It's unacceptable!
You always scurry around!

1625
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Where the hell have you been? Where?

1626
01:40:33,791 --> 01:40:37,166
All right, brothers and sisters.
I'm going to say some hard things.

1627
01:40:37,833 --> 01:40:40,250
You all scurried around
when you saw the dynamite.

1628
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:41,875
It's unacceptable.

1629
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:45,958
What happened to your fighting skills
and your ranting and raving?

1630
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:47,333
Are you afraid of dynamite?

1631
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:49,916
Thanks to the well, nothing happened.

1632
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:52,750
And you can thank me
for covering the well.

1633
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:56,208
I sat on it to absorb the pressure
and the dynamite exploded in my ass.

1634
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:57,250
Did I have to do this?

1635
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,666
Anyway, I won't insult you
before the couple anymore.

1636
01:41:02,333 --> 01:41:04,958
Today, we're here for a happy event.

1637
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:08,666
We're going to celebrate
the marriage of this couple.

1638
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:12,833
Now I'm going to ask the Hunkutu chief,
do you give permission?

1639
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:13,916
I do.

1640
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,333
-The Nahu chief, do you give permission?
-I do.

1641
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:22,958
As Sokachu, now I pronounce you man
and wife by the authority vested in me

1642
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,625
by the two tribes.

1643
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:32,541
That's how it's supposed to be done.

1644
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:43,000
Nurullah, do you see what I'm seeing now?

1645
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,208
I do, man!

1646
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:45,958
-Is that the Turkish flag?
-It is!

1647
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:49,666
Oh God, we made it!
We made it, Nurullah! They've arrived!

1648
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,166
The Turks have arrived!

1649
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,041
Oh, God, they're Turkish soldiers!

1650
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:55,500
Chief, they're ours!
Don't worry. It's okay!

1651
01:41:55,625 --> 01:41:57,541
Let's go, Nurullah! Come on!

1652
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:03,125
They really are Turkish soldiers,
Nurullah!

1653
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:06,208
God bless you, sir! Thank you so much!

1654
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:08,083
Are you Recep İvedik
and Nurullah Sağlam?

1655
01:42:08,166 --> 01:42:11,208
-We are.
-We're Turkish soldiers.

1656
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:15,041
We're here to send you back to Turkey
by order of our embassy.

1657
01:42:15,375 --> 01:42:18,458
Thank you so much!
But, sir, we've been here too long.

1658
01:42:18,791 --> 01:42:20,208
We have something to finish.

1659
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:22,958
We'll finish it and get back to you
if that's okay.

1660
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:25,791
It's okay. We'll wait for you
now that we've found you.

1661
01:42:25,875 --> 01:42:28,875
You're the man!
Way to go, Turkish soldiers!

1662
01:42:29,041 --> 01:42:30,500
Let's go, Nurullah.

1663
01:42:38,083 --> 01:42:41,291
Dear brothers and sisters,
I have to tell you something important.

1664
01:42:43,416 --> 01:42:44,458
I'm not Sokachu.

1665
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:50,291
My name is Recep İvedik.
We're not who you think we are.

1666
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:55,166
We lied to you because we thought
you would kill us. But I'm glad we lied.

1667
01:42:55,625 --> 01:42:59,000
Am I right? The conflict
between the two tribes has ended.

1668
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,500
Two people who love each other
have got married.

1669
01:43:02,583 --> 01:43:03,916
It's great, right?

1670
01:43:04,458 --> 01:43:06,875
It doesn't matter being Sokachu,
my friends.

1671
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:09,333
What matters is being human.

1672
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,166
Now, I want to return
this beautiful necklace,

1673
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:17,750
given to me when I became Sokachu,
to its true owner.

1674
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:19,625
If the young couple would step forward.

1675
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:29,416
I want to give this necklace named
Soul of Jungle, which was given to me,

1676
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:32,583
to the bride to keep forever...

1677
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:37,458
for the reason that men make houses
and women make homes. Take it, dear.

1678
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:39,708
Here you go.

1679
01:43:40,125 --> 01:43:43,416
Keep it. Pass it to your children
and your grandchildren, okay?

1680
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:47,875
-Thanks, buddy. You're the man.
-Thank you, brother.

1681
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:52,708
You're the man. A true gentleman.
Stay with your family.

1682
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:54,291
-You got it.
-All right.

1683
01:44:02,125 --> 01:44:04,250
Chief. It's time to say goodbye.

1684
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:07,166
Those are Turkish soldiers.

1685
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:10,750
They're from our homeland.
They're here to take us back.

1686
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:12,000
We have to go.

1687
01:44:12,625 --> 01:44:14,041
Your name's not Sokachu.

1688
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:17,666
But you're the true Sokachu.

1689
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,625
You're a brave man.

1690
01:44:20,458 --> 01:44:23,666
You and your friend... are good people.

1691
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:25,375
Thank you.

1692
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:30,041
-Thank you. I feel the same.
-You're brave. You're a great man.

1693
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:31,916
Thank you. So are you.

1694
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:35,625
I want to say goodbye
with your traditional moves.

1695
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,291
No, no, no, no!

1696
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:45,541
Take care and goodbye!
Come on, Nurullah. Let's go.

1697
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:54,125
Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu!

1698
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:58,916
Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu! Sokachu!

1699
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,291
Sokachu! Sokachu!

1700
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,500
Why are you doing this now?

1701
01:45:10,041 --> 01:45:12,250
Let's give them a proper answer, Nurullah.

1702
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:20,083
Take care!

1703
01:45:20,583 --> 01:45:21,625
Goodbye!

1704
01:45:29,083 --> 01:45:30,750
-Nurullah?
-Yeah?

1705
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:32,791
-Do you know what we forgot?
-What?

1706
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:35,791
-A wedding ceremony without halay...
-Isn't a ceremony.

1707
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:37,750
That's right brother.

1708
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:40,166
Come on!
