00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:06,059
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today
we're going to get close, like really close.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,648
In fact, I want to answer the question
what's the closest we can get to other objects

3
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:12,728
and other people?

4
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:15,608
Now, it might sound like kind of a simple easy question,

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:17,848
but when we get down to the atoms of it,

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:22,858
it's quite complex and might leave
you feeling a little bit alone.

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,859
When I go like this, my fingers, for all
intents and purposes, are touching.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,038
But, at an atomic level, they're not.

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,208
That's right, in fact, if you're sitting in a chair

10
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:39,298
right now, your body is technically not touching the chair

11
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,338
at all. Instead, you are hovering above the chair

12
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:46,379
by some tiny, tiny atomically sized gap,

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,508
something too small for us to even see, but it's there.

14
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:54,138
And it's caused by the fact that your butt and the chair are made out of atoms.

15
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:58,459
Now, as we all know, the matter that we deal with every day is made out of atoms.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,608
And an atom is a nucleus surrounded by an outer shell

17
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:03,988
of orbiting electrons.

18
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,368
Now when two atoms get close to each other
that aren't going to bond or chemically react,

19
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,068
they have trouble touching each other.

20
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:14,548
Why? Because electrons repel one another,

21
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,188
because they have the same charge.

22
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:20,088
And because of a fancy thing
called the Pauli exclusion principle,

23
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:22,728
we also know that all of an atoms electrons

24
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,188
cannot all be pushed down to the same energy level
all together on the same shell.

25
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:33,398
So what this means is that if I touch something,
I'm technically not really touching it.

26
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,438
The atoms are getting quite close together,

27
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,839
but the electromagnetic repulsion between electrons

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,879
is saying no, no, no, no, closer.

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,448
Now, of course, the nerves in my skin can feel that repulsive force and that's what I call

30
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:49,148
the texture or the feeling of the object.

31
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,068
If I push hard enough of course, I can break or poke into

32
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,028
or cut something, but I'm not touching

33
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:59,338
any of its matter, I'm just pushing it out of the way

34
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:02,559
using the electron-electron repulsion forces.

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,798
Even though you can cut things really easily like this,

36
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,838
the scissors never touched the card.

37
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,679
This is where it gets depressing.

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,178
What all of this means is that when you kissed
your girlfriend or pet your dog

39
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:21,059
or hug your grandmother, you're not actually
making contact with their matter.

40
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,379
You're not technically touching them, you're just feeling

41
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,539
the repulsive force of their electrons.

42
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,039
But maybe there's hope.

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,458
Let's just avoid electrons altogether and ask ourselves

44
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:39,759
what can we do to affect the nucleus of
someone else's atoms?

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,779
Maybe we can do that?

46
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,159
You're going to have to be a little bit
radioactive if you're going to want to do this

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,559
and luckily, people are a little bit radioactive.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,008
In fact, if you sleep in a bed with another person
for an entire year,

49
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:58,008
your body is actually exposed to one millirem

50
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,548
more radiation than someone who sleeps alone.

51
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:05,688
Now, we are talking about tiny, tiny amounts that really don't affect your body at all,

52
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,238
but still, they are there.
How did they get there?

53
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,998
Well, carbon 14 is in the air, and potassium 40

54
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,859
is in bananas, that's right.

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,319
Bananas have a really high potassium content.

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,698
In fact, any food that has a lot of potassium in it, like Brazil nuts, is going to act the same way.

57
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,668
All of that potassium is fine and dandy,

58
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,558
but about one out of every 8,000 or so potassium atoms

59
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:30,099
is a radioactive isotope of potassium.

60
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,079
In fact, if you were to eat 600 bananas,

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,298
it would be the equivalent of getting a chest x-ray.

62
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,139
Okay, cool, so I am a little bit radioactive.

63
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,839
Does that mean that if I hug someone really close that some sort of radioactive ray

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,299
might come out of my body and go into someone else's body and get absorbed into

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,999
a nucleus of one of their atoms and then we could really finally say that we touched on a fundamental level?

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,158
Maybe.

67
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,399
The radiation that comes out of us is very unlikely to hit someone else's atoms and

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,499
because people don't contain
a lot of radioactive material

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,248
in the bodies, that energy is just going to get absorbed and you're not going to really know that it happens

70
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,058
and the chance, like I said, is super unlikely.

71
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:19,677
So maybe we should go back
a little bit and talk about chemical reactions.

72
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:22,579
Back when I mentioned
that atoms have trouble touching,

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,619
they are a little more friendly if they
get together and, you know, share electrons.

74
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,028
Now, this kind of stuff is happening all the time.

75
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:34,698
When I eat food, my body is chemically reacting with that food to take out the nutrients,

76
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,528
get rid of the stuff I don't want, but
short of being a cannibal

77
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,088
and eating someone's arm or being a zombie,

78
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:46,968
how can I get chemically,
reactionally close to a person?

79
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:50,788
Well, luckily, there is a thing called birth.

80
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,138
When you're growing inside your mother,

81
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,559
your father and mother's DNA
are all working together

82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,379
in chemical ways to create you.

83
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,518
Because they're sharing electrons
it seems at least more like a touch.

84
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,658
I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in a way,
your parents and your children

85
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:13,608
are the only people you can know for
certain you've come the closest

86
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:16,979
to actually touching.

87
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,859
And that's touching.

88
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,819
And as always,

89
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,100
thanks for watching.
