1
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,526
[Michael]
 This is Iquitos, Peru,

2
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:31,362
the world's largest city
inaccessible by road.

3
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:35,800
 The only way in and out
 is by air or by river,

4
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,569
 the Amazon River.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,672
I'm about to head up the Amazon
to a remote jungle retreat

6
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:45,477
called Refugio Altiplano,
the Refuge on the Higher Plain.

7
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,745
There, I will meet
with local shamans

8
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:57,555
to drink an ancient
psychedelic drug, ayahuasca.

9
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:01,593
Ayahuasca contains
dimethyltryptamine, DMT,

10
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,895
a molecule shaped
very similar to serotonin,

11
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:07,198
 a neurotransmitter
 in our brains.

12
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:10,301
Ingesting ayahuasca and flooding
the brain with DMT

13
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:13,771
leads to what many describe
as spiritual experiences--

14
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,406
 strong, vivid visions,

15
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,610
 a sense of oneness
 with the universe,

16
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:22,180
even a sense
of one's self dying.

17
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,782
But mystical,
magical language like that

18
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:26,918
doesn't really seem relevant
to scientific inquiry.

19
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:29,921
It can often scare away those
who are scientifically minded.

20
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:32,624
However an understanding
of the human mind

21
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,392
isn't complete unless
it considers

22
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,895
everything the brain
is capable of.

23
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:42,233
What does it mean to feel
at one with the universe?

24
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:44,936
Why should our brains even
be capable of such a feeling?

25
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:48,773
This isn't about having fun
or taking a risk

26
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:50,642
or doing something extreme.

27
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,212
I want to learn
what my mind is capable of.

28
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:56,948
I'm about to embark
on a journey.

29
00:01:56,949 --> 00:02:16,834
[theme music playing]

30
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,270
Psychedelics are chemicals

31
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:22,273
that are structurally similar
to neurotransmitters

32
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:24,676
 already used by our brains.

33
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,478
 When we ingest them,
 they bind to receptors

34
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,547
 and alter cognition
 and perception

35
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:32,483
 in ways we're still trying
 to understand.

36
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:35,253
 When many people think
 of psychedelics,

37
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:38,523
 they think about people
 challenging societal norms

38
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:39,891
 and recreational
 thrill-seekers,

39
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,893
 but that only attends

40
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:45,897
 to a particularly narrow slice
 of human history and culture.

41
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:49,534
 Fossil records, cave drawings,
 and archaeological digs

42
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,536
 have all provided evidence
 that humans

43
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,805
 have been using
 psychedelic compounds

44
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,875
 for thousands of years, and
 by "used," I don't just mean

45
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:59,544
 in the stereotypical
 "trip out" sense.

46
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,945
[screaming]

47
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:02,847
For instance,
among the indigenous peoples

48
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,317
of the Amazon rainforest,
psychedelics were and,

49
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,921
in many places, still are
a normal, common,

50
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:12,490
and totally
mainstream experience.

51
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,561
As a member of these groups,
believing psychedelics can heal,

52
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:19,964
give visions of the future,
and connect you with deities

53
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,967
is not some weird
or New Age idea.

54
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:25,403
It's the way things are.

55
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:27,705
 But when psychedelics
 became associated

56
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,308
 with certain
 counterculture movements,

57
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:33,544
 the United States banned
 research on them in 1970.

58
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,514
 Most other countries followed
 suit shortly afterwards.

59
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:40,385
 From then on, testing on humans
 was essentially gone,

60
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,621
but recently, restrictions
have begun to loosen up,

61
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:44,856
and a few researchers
have started

62
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,724
to investigate these substances

63
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:50,662
in what some have described
as a psychedelic renaissance.

64
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,830
 Research universities
 are conducting

65
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,999
 comprehensive studies
 on the beneficial effects

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,468
 of psychedelics on addiction,
 depression,

67
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,903
 and cancer-related trauma.

68
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,906
By approaching
psychedelics scientifically,

69
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,709
what we find could
fundamentally transform

70
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:11,716
our understanding
of the human mind.

71
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:14,919
[trimmer buzzing]

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,422
When I go to Peru,
I will be accompanied

73
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,058
by Dr. Robin Carhart Harris,
one of the first

74
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,327
British researchers
in over 40 years

75
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,495
to investigate the effects
of psychedelics

76
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:26,064
on the human mind.

77
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,032
He and his colleagues
have found that psychedelics

78
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,968
don't increase brain activity,
as previously thought.

79
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:34,906
 Instead, they decrease activity
 in certain areas.

80
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,741
 And the greater the decrease,

81
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:38,509
the greater
the reported feelings

82
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,581
of what is called
ego dissolution or ego death.

83
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:46,684
 Your ego is your self-identity.

84
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:50,355
 It's the part that separates
 you from everything else,

85
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,558
 the part
 that creates narratives about
 the outside world

86
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,460
 and your story in it.

87
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,929
When the ego dissolves,
your sensations

88
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,566
and feelings don't cease
like when you're unconscious.

89
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,969
 Instead, your attachment
 to your identity does,

90
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,073
 and all that's left
 is naked perception.

91
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:10,875
Ego dissolution is a concept

92
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:13,644
that I find difficult
to wrap my head around,

93
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,980
but people who take psychedelics
say that it can be

94
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,616
an extremely
frightening experience,

95
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:21,652
but also a profoundly
transformative one,

96
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:23,488
 one that makes them feel
 more connected

97
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,057
 to others and to nature.

98
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:29,460
Now, I knew that I might feel
ego dissolution on ayahuasca,

99
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,028
so to make sure I was ready,

100
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,666
I decided to speak
to some experts.

101
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,970
 Before setting off to Peru,
 Dr. Carhart Harris traveled

102
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,606
 from Imperial College, London,
 to meet with me.

103
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,674
This will be one
of the first times

104
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:48,546
that anyone has scanned
a healthy person's brain

105
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:52,650
with FMRI before
and after ayahuasca.

106
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:56,487
-Yeah.
-It's quite pioneering work,
really.

107
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:59,157
The thing that's on my mind
right now is intention.

108
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,659
-Yeah.
-I've heard you should know why

109
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,961
you're drinking ayahuasca.

110
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,864
Yeah, I would suggest
that you think

111
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,133
about an emotional intention.

112
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:12,870
To make it emotional is
a lot more frightening to me.

113
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:14,972
-Yeah.
-Partly I think I'm quite happy,

114
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,975
and I don't want
to ruin that, right?

115
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:22,513
I don't want to drink
ayahuasca and then
think, "Oh, my gosh,

116
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,916
I'm not close enough
to my mom,

117
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,585
or I don't show my wife
I appreciate her enough,

118
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,687
and now
I just feel terrible."

119
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:32,623
There's something to be said
for sitting with those thoughts,

120
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,559
-being mindful of them.
-Right.

121
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,496
And in so doing,
they become less of a threat.

122
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,064
-Hmm.
-You look them in the eye.

123
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:43,534
All of a sudden,
they reveal things to you,

124
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:47,171
and their scariness
seems to dissipate.

125
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,941
I hope I can embrace
that while I'm surrounded

126
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,977
by people who are
all filming me, you know?

127
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,682
Yeah, the most important thing
is that intention to go in.

128
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,051
-You dive in--
in and through.
-You don't resist.

129
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,053
You don't resist.

130
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,788
Yeah, I think that'll
really be important

131
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,958
while I'm on the trip.

132
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,494
 [Michael] Robin has
 arranged for a number
 of scientific tests

133
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,896
 to be done in order to measure
 brain activity,

134
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:13,531
 behavioral differences,

135
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:15,733
 and physiological changes
 to my brain.

136
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,735
[Robin] Today, we are scanning
 Michael's brain

137
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:20,838
with functional magnetic
resonance imaging, or FMRI.

138
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,641
 This allows us to see
 the whole brain

139
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:26,777
 and how different parts connect
 and talk to one another.

140
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:29,747
 This way, we can compare
 how Michael's brain may change

141
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,582
 before his experience
 with ayahuasca

142
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,051
to after
the ayahuasca experience.

143
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:36,687
 I expect to see
 that one network of the brain

144
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:38,656
 that relates to introspection

145
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:46,297
 will become more strongly
 connected after the ayahuasca.

146
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:47,965
[Michael]
 After meeting Robin,

147
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:50,167
 I still felt some trepidation
 about my trip,

148
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,204
 but with my pre-ayahuasca
 FMRI completed,

149
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:58,309
 it was time to set off
 for Peru.

150
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,279
 The trip to the Refugio
 Altiplano retreat

151
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,916
 involved a flight
 to Lima, Peru,

152
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,785
 a second flight
 to Iquitos, Peru,

153
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:12,323
 followed by a 90-minute
 boat ride up the Amazon River.

154
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,825
 It was a long journey.

155
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,761
 And every minute I got closer

156
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,698
 meant that it would be harder
 to turn back.

157
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,001
 The Refugio Altiplano retreat
 is in a very remote area

158
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,104
 of the Amazon River
 in the northern part of Peru,

159
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,840
 and I thought it would be
 a great setting

160
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,642
 for my ayahuasca experience.

161
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:35,112
So, Kelly, what does
the word "ayahuasca" mean?

162
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:38,249
"Ayahuasca" means
the "vine of the soul."

163
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,053
Ayahuasca's been used
for possibly over 4,000 years

164
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,089
in shamanic rituals
and is the primary

165
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,895
plant medicine
for healing in the villages.

166
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,598
[Michael] With the ayahuasca
 ceremony just hours away,

167
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,900
 I met with José,
 the shaman who would be

168
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:57,969
 my guide
 during this experience.

169
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,870
 -Hola, José, Claudia.
 -Hola, amigo.

170
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,807
[speaking Spanish]

171
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,643
[speaking Spanish]

172
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,878
[translating]
It's my pleasure
to have you here.

173
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,214
Welcome
to Refugio Altiplano,

174
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:13,017
where many people come
to look for a change
in their lives.

175
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:16,153
José, how do you
feel about someone
like me coming in,

176
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:20,658
who is not part
of your culture,
taking part in it

177
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:23,361
in a way
that might not come
from the same history?

178
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,096
[speaking Spanish]

179
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,831
[Claudia]
For me, there's no difference,

180
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,200
and for the medicine,
it makes no difference.

181
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:33,004
This medicine, all it wants
is to make your life better

182
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,271
and heal you.

183
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:36,240
On the very first night
with our guests,

184
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,410
we give them a very small
medicinal dose

185
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,912
to see how each person's
gonna react differently

186
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,914
to the medicine,
and then tomorrow night,

187
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:46,651
we'll dial it up a little bit.

188
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,753
[Michael] It was great
 to speak with José

189
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,921
 about what the ceremony
 will entail.

190
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,824
 I am nervous about
 the emotional part of it,

191
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,860
and I'm nervous
about the visions and feeling

192
00:09:55,861 --> 00:10:01,098
like I've been disconnected
from the real world.

193
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:04,301
 Scientists know very little
 about how ayahuasca works

194
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:07,004
 since its illegal status
 in many countries

195
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,739
 makes it difficult to study.

196
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,708
 We do know that
 its key ingredient

197
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,045
 is dimethyltryptamine, or DMT,
 which is a hallucinogen

198
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,013
 thought to occur naturally
 in the human brain

199
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:17,815
 in small amounts.

200
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:21,085
 DMT can create
 psychoactive effects

201
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:24,088
 by acting on certain receptors
 in the brain.

202
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,260
But normally, DMT is broken down
rapidly by enzymes in the brain.

203
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:33,264
 but ayahuasca is actually
 a brew made from two plants.

204
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,266
 One contains DMT,

205
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,168
 and the second contains
 a chemical inhibitor

206
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,937
 that blocks our brain's ability
 to break down DMT,

207
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:46,343
 allowing the effects to last
 as long as four hours.

208
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,246
 Dr. Carhart Harris performed
 a series of tests on me

209
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,716
 to compare how I change
 during this experience.

210
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,385
[Robin]
Given that we're in Peru,
we're in the jungle,

211
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:58,155
and you're
drinking ayahuasca,
it has authenticity

212
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:00,191
that perhaps
sometimes you lose

213
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,960
when you give psychedelics
in the laboratory
environment.

214
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,763
-Yeah.
-Because we're
going to be doing this

215
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:10,267
after you drink ayahuasca,
we need a control condition,

216
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,837
so what I'm going to do now
is I'll ask you

217
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,307
a short list of questions
about your journey here,

218
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,910
and I want you
to rate how you feel
about these questions

219
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,278
on a scale here.

220
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,379
We have zero to nine.

221
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,248
Nine will be strongly agree,

222
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:27,151
and zero will be
strongly disagree.

223
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:30,187
So "I learned more
from my journey here

224
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:34,258
to this retreat center
about how past events

225
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:36,527
have influenced
my present behavior."

226
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:37,995
Two.

227
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:40,898
-I got ideas areas during...
-Two.

228
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,367
-Five. Six.
-Great.

229
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:46,504
With different
psychedelic drugs to ayahuasca

230
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,807
 like LSD and psilocybin,
 also DMT,

231
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:51,942
 we've found some quite
 consistent changes

232
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:53,511
in brain activity.

233
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,546
 We've seen
 that the brain activity

234
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,448
 is richer and more varied.

235
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:00,317
 Of course,
 we can't wheel an MRI scanner

236
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:03,521
 up into the jungle,
 so the EEG setup that we have

237
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,856
 is pretty much
 the best possibility

238
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:10,127
 that we have to do this.

239
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:13,063
[Michael]
 According to Jose, this flower
 bath was meant

240
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,799
 to protect me from bad spirits
 during the ceremony. 

241
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,568
-[Michael speaks Spanish]
-[José chuckles]

242
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,904
 I didn't believe in such
 things, but I was glad to do it

243
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:38,289
 because it was a symbol
 of José's good intentions.

244
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,991
 Hola.
 Buenas noches.

245
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,994
[Michael] The initial
 smaller-dose ceremony

246
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:46,163
 was expected to last
 about two hours

247
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:49,834
 with the effects beginning
 after 30 minutes.

248
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,170
[José speaking Spanish]

249
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:57,608
We'll begin
with our ceremony tonight,
asking God to guide us,

250
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:01,011
to give us knowledge
and intelligence.

251
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,546
[José speaking Spanish]

252
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,015
[Claudia]
We're going to bless
the medicine first.

253
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:22,399
[music playing]

254
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:33,077
 Gracias.

255
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,246
[Michael]
 The ayahuasca tasted earthy.

256
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,981
[speaking Spanish]

257
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,883
 Maybe also a bit like fennel
 or something.

258
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,351
 It's hard to say.

259
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,286
 I'd never tasted
 anything like it.

260
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:43,888
 After swallowing it all,

261
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,923
 my heart started racing. 

262
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,925
 It was the most nervous
 I would be all night.

263
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:51,028
 DMT from the ayahuasca
 was flowing

264
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,463
 into my blood and brain.

265
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,965
 There was no going back.

266
00:13:54,966 --> 00:14:04,508
[José chanting]

267
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,511
 Throughout the ceremony,
 shaman José is saying icaros,

268
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:10,114
 or chants,
 which were meant to guide me

269
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,016
 through my spiritual
 experience.

270
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:32,002
[chanting continues]

271
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:38,309
[José chanting]

272
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,344
 The initial dose was meant
 to gently introduce me

273
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:41,946
 to ayahuasca.

274
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,315
 The effects began slowly
 and were mild.

275
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,216
 I began to feel
 as though the room

276
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,218
 were swinging like a cradle.

277
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,688
 I was aware that the motion
 wasn't really happening,

278
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,456
 but it made me feel sick

279
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:55,125
 and nervously off-balance
 nonetheless.

280
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:57,328
 My imagination was more vivid.

281
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,229
 Images in my mind
 were more detailed,

282
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:09,306
 but almost always
 under my control.

283
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:12,309
 The ceremony ends when
 the shaman lights a candle.

284
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,645
 I was comforted by this
 because it was a sign

285
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:17,047
 that the effects would
 only be weakening from here.

286
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:21,085
Thank you, José.

287
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,519
I think there were two moments
where I was actually

288
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,091
was surprised
by something that I saw.

289
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,660
One was like a very vivid--

290
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:34,531
like bamboo that had been cut
so that it was at a slant,

291
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:37,301
and I remember going,
"Wow, where did that come from?"

292
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:40,137
-But as soon as I did,
it was gone.
-Mm-hmm.

293
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:42,239
[Robin] One of the effects
 of ayahuasca

294
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,576
is to kind of create
a sort of chaos in the cortex.

295
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,746
 That can lead
 to dreamlike visions.

296
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,282
The second time I was like,
"Oh, yeah, nature,"

297
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,752
and, like, "Do I feel more
at one with everything?"

298
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,222
And I imagined trees,
but only in this ring.

299
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,457
And all of a sudden,
they came really close,

300
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,460
and they were all
right here in my head.

301
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:06,530
But I was like,
"I did not think that.

302
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,266
I didn't intend
for that to happen.

303
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,435
[Michael]
 I think a good comparison
 for what I felt last night--

304
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:14,505
if you, in a sober state
of mind, just imagine something,

305
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,341
like think of a pink elephant.

306
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:20,110
Okay, now an image
probably popped into your mind,

307
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:21,779
but not like
a super detailed one.

308
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,314
If I asked you
a specific question like,

309
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,116
"How many wrinkles
are on its trunk?"

310
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,651
you'd have to probably
imagine it again

311
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:30,721
and then, like, basically
fill in that detail.

312
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:33,257
But under the effects
of ayahuasca,

313
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,760
those details were already
in these--

314
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:39,630
these imagined images.

315
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,266
They seemed only as real
as an imagined image,

316
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,834
as a daydream,

317
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,236
but they came with more detail,
and a few times--

318
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:49,073
I'd say maybe
three or four times,

319
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:54,478
 things appeared that I did not
 feel like I had put there.

320
00:16:54,479 --> 00:17:00,717
But as soon as I was aware
of that, they disappeared.

321
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:02,786
I'd like to look at the stars.

322
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:10,126
Yeah, let's do that.

323
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:12,629
 The morning after
 my initial dose of ayahuasca,

324
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,631
 my head was clearer,
 and I wanted to discuss

325
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,467
 my experience was shaman José.

326
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,568
 -Hola, Michael.
 -Hola.

327
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,337
[speaking Spanish]

328
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:23,473
You had a perfect
introduction ceremony.

329
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,741
Emotionally
and sort of personally,

330
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,679
the only sort of
revelations I had

331
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,448
was that I was probably
more worried

332
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:32,716
than I needed to be
beforehand

333
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,885
and that I let that affect
my behavior,

334
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:37,154
and now I'm not
as dominated

335
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,690
by what might happen
or what has happened.

336
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,792
I'm just kind of
in this moment right now.

337
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:45,696
Like, I feel much more open
to mystical thinking.

338
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,398
[speaking Spanish]

339
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:53,170
He recommends
that you complete with
more medicine tonight

340
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,739
so that this will help you
complete

341
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,341
the insight into yourself.

342
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,277
Last night,
I had a third of a cup?

343
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,845
[speaking Spanish]

344
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:04,281
Three-quarters will be
the dose for tonight.

345
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:05,883
Three-quarters. Okay.

346
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,652
It's weird.
I had an intention going in.

347
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,420
 I experienced this

348
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:13,790
 as a very interesting
 scientific endeavor.

349
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:17,794
 But I'm fascinated by how
 I want it to have meaning.

350
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:21,231
 I feel like I didn't hit
 that oneness yet.

351
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:23,467
Tonight might be different.

352
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,802
 [Robin] Michael's getting
 the higher dose tonight,

353
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:29,206
and the experience
is very likely to differ

354
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:33,210
 quite substantially
 from the dose
 that he had last night.

355
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,847
 [Michael] I'm interested
 in personal development.

356
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:40,250
I know that that's a big part
of ayahuasca

357
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,519
for a lot of people.

358
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,590
I'm open to it, for sure,
but I do feel still

359
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:56,700
 some apprehension
 for a larger dose tonight.

360
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,402
Hey, Michael?

361
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:07,911
I'm here to pick you up
for ceremony.

362
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:26,697
 -Buenas noches.
 -Buenas noches.

363
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,365
[Michael]
 The higher-dose ceremony

364
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,267
 was expected to last four hours

365
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:37,708
 with stronger
 and more vivid hallucinations.

366
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,378
 José smoked a cigar
 made of a tobacco plant

367
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:45,482
 that's indigenous
 to the Amazon called mapacho.

368
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:48,352
 The smoke is believed to clean
 the energy fields of the body

369
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,787
 and remove negativity
 from the ceremonial lodge.

370
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:54,558
[exhales slowly]

371
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:07,671
 The second ceremony included
 another shaman, Daniel.

372
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:22,719
[chanting]

373
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,555
 I started to see
 these very geometric,

374
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:29,726
bright squares, like,
stacked like Aztec pyramids,

375
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,629
 moving,
 and I was traveling down

376
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,733
through these, like,
repeating kind of, you know,

377
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:38,802
fractaled images of everything.

378
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:40,604
I mean, too many things
to really describe,

379
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:44,508
music notes and colors
and shapes and squares.

380
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,843
 Then I started to feel like,
 "Oh, my gosh,

381
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:49,546
this is going faster and faster,
and this is too fast,

382
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:51,348
and it hasn't even been
that long,"

383
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,785
and then I felt my body being
covered with these blocks,

384
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:58,922
 and I, like,
 saw my body from above

385
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,058
 and felt like
 I was disappearing.

386
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,993
 [José chanting]

387
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,695
 And that's when my heart
 started racing,

388
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,764
 and I said,
 "Mm, this was very bad.

389
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:11,401
 This is not good."

390
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:14,871
 A lot of emotions I always have
 were amplified

391
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:16,973
so loudly
I couldn't ignore them.

392
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:23,080
 And I had to come up
 with ways to console myself

393
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,115
so that I wouldn't
be consumed by them

394
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:28,385
and have a complete breakdown
and panic attack.

395
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,954
 And I resisted,

396
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:34,558
and I successfully
brought myself back

397
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,994
to calmness just by saying,
"I'm fine.

398
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:47,771
I'm not going to die,
and everyone here can help me."

399
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:50,707
 The visions were really,
 really vivid.

400
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,642
 They didn't feel like
 they were under my control.

401
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:54,611
It really felt
like they were just there.

402
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:58,081
A note from the song
would occur,

403
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:01,451
and it would cause this image,
and that was pretty frightening,

404
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:03,053
because I wasn't--
I was, like, on a ride

405
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:06,790
that I didn't know
the path of.

406
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:18,034
[distorted chanting]

407
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:20,437
-Robin?
-Yeah.

408
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:24,574
-I can do the EEG now.
-Yeah, sure.

409
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,943
[Michael] I spent a lot
 of the ceremony being anxious

410
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,045
about having to do
these tests with Robin.

411
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:32,716
 I don't know how to deal
 with the lights coming back on

412
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:36,520
 and Robin talking to me
 and asking me questions,

413
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,723
 but the more I concentrated
 on why I feel anxious,

414
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:42,125
the more I realized
it was just about me.

415
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:44,561
It was about how I felt,
but then I said,

416
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:47,464
"I'm here to do a show.
We're filming this.

417
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:48,999
Robin wants this data.

418
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,768
Everyone will be happier
if I do it.

419
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,438
 So I'll just tell Robin
 I'll try my best,

420
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,206
 and that gave me
 the courage to do it.

421
00:22:56,207 --> 00:23:00,143
So being less selfish

422
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:03,980
basically saved me
from a panic attack.

423
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:06,917
[Robin] Each time
I read an item, if you
could give me a number

424
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,454
according to how
you see yourself
at this moment, okay?

425
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:17,194
"I see myself right now
as extroverted,
enthusiastic."

426
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,830
Um... one.

427
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,498
Okay.

428
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:23,099
[Robin] This is a big change
 for Michael.

429
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,901
 Usually,
 he's very extroverted,

430
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,903
 and on
 his pre-ayahuasca answer,

431
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,605
 he gave a higher number.

432
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:31,875
"Extroverted, enthusiastic."

433
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,710
Five.

434
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,546
[Robin] But now I'm seeing
 signs of withdrawal

435
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,648
 and introversion from him.

436
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:44,120
"I see myself right now
as critical, quarrelsome."

437
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:47,491
Uh...

438
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,025
two.

439
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:53,830
"I see myself right now
as critical, quarrelsome."

440
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:55,732
Six.

441
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,969
[Robin] The experience
 has led to a change

442
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,604
 in how he sees himself.

443
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,206
It's in a way reflective

444
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,209
perhaps
of a higher waking state.

445
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,078
[plucks notes]

446
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,914
 It's interesting
 to already see those changes,

447
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:19,589
 and it's only halfway
 through the ceremony.

448
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:24,261
[Daniel singing
in native language]

449
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,795
[Michael]
 Shaman Daniel sang in Shipibo,

450
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,531
 his indigenous language

451
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:35,005
 spoken by only 5,000 people
 in the world.

452
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,774
 I've always been frustrated
 by the difficulty people had

453
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,242
 in explaining
 what it felt like

454
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:41,678
 to have a psychedelic
 experience.

455
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,913
 Now I know why.

456
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,115
 It's a different
 state of mind,

457
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,918
 and trying to describe that
 is like trying to describe

458
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,287
 anger to someone
 who has never felt it

459
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,590
 or what colors are like
 to a blind person.

460
00:24:53,591 --> 00:25:14,077
[singing continues]

461
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,612
Oh, man.

462
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,214
[chuckles]

463
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:24,054
I'd say about five minutes
into that first song...

464
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,189
I...

465
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,059
really panicked.

466
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,028
My heart rate picked up,
and I actually touched my chest

467
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:36,032
to make sure it wasn't beating
as fast as I thought it was.

468
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,368
But that moment,
I may have left my body

469
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,338
or something near it
before I stopped.

470
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,374
I was very scared
that I was disappearing.

471
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:48,979
Michael is describing
what to me sounds like

472
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,048
quintessential ego dissolution,
the start of it,

473
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:54,951
that feeling
that he's disappearing,

474
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:58,188
 that his control over his mind
 and his body

475
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,724
is ceding entirely,

476
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,160
and he felt
some resistance to that.

477
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:05,795
 With a high enough dose,

478
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:07,931
 you're just forced
 into that space.

479
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:11,101
 My feeling is that
 the intensity of his experience

480
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,170
was just short of that
kind of profound

481
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:16,206
transformative type experience.

482
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,807
I think he got a bit of that,

483
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:19,676
but I don't think
he was all the way.

484
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:22,412
[Michael] I was there
 in that ego-dissolving state

485
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:25,081
 for a moment,
 and it terrified me.

486
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:27,417
 I wish I was able
 to surrender more fully,

487
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:38,995
 but I definitely
 got a good taste of it.

488
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:42,198
So the dosage last night
was much higher.

489
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,134
Yes.

490
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:48,805
Visions--
the visuals were really vivid,

491
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:53,076
and the feeling of strangeness
was really strong.

492
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:57,914
I'd be curious to know
what José was doing last night.

493
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:00,183
What was he reacting to
that he saw in me.

494
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:02,252
What plants did he call forth
and why?

495
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,287
[speaking Spanish]

496
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:07,323
He knew you were going through
an intense ceremony.

497
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:10,093
It was strong for you.

498
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:13,396
But he said he was very happy
because he knew

499
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:16,166
this was going to have
a positive ending for you.

500
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,235
I'm really interested
in what the lessons were.

501
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:24,974
I felt so small...
and so humble.

502
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:29,412
But-- but, honestly, I liked it.
I wasn't afraid of it.

503
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:35,385
I was glad to be reminded
that I'm weak.

504
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:37,387
I feel like the experience
amplified

505
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:42,726
everything I'm concerned about
way above what would be

506
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,794
a normal amount
to care about it.

507
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:47,764
But that made my fear
and anxiety big enough

508
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:50,100
that I could actually
relax them.

509
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,202
The question is
will I remember to apply that,

510
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,171
or will this kind of stay
in the jungle?

511
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:56,973
 Before leaving Peru,

512
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:59,275
 I completed one last round
 of tests with Robin...

513
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:01,044
I'll place this
on your head.

514
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:02,779
 ...in order to gather data

515
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,883
 after my higher dose
 of ayahuasca.

516
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:08,284
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

517
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,920
I can't wait to see you
back in L.A.

518
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:13,423
and see what other thoughts
you've had with these tests.

519
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:15,825
[Robin] Being here in
 the jungle, it's more organic.

520
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:19,229
 Because of that,
 I feel that I've collected data

521
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,499
 that's going to tell us
 something important

522
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,268
 and meaningful
 about how psychedelics

523
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:36,012
and ayahuasca specifically
work on the mind and the brain.

524
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,281
 After returning home
 to Los Angeles,

525
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:40,383
 I had my second MRI
 so that Robin could see

526
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,418
 if there were any changes.

527
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,955
 Although my ego dissolved
 only for a brief few moments,

528
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:48,925
 I was teetering on that edge
 throughout the entire ceremony,

529
00:28:48,926 --> 00:29:00,970
 and I was anxious to see what
 it looked like in my brain.

530
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:04,507
Robin, welcome to my home.
Thank you for coming back.

531
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:07,110
I can't wait to see
what results you got.

532
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:10,013
-Yeah.
-How did ayahuasca
affect my brain?

533
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:14,117
Okay, so we found
something quite interesting.

534
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:19,289
We found that your brain
activity became more complex,

535
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,892
 more diverse, more rich,
 more varied

536
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:25,461
 under the ayahuasca
 than at baseline.

537
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:26,863
What does it mean to have

538
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:28,364
more complex brain activity

539
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,533
in terms of how
I experience things?

540
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:34,037
Mm, I think
we can understand it in terms

541
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:40,210
of the richness of your
imagination, of your ideas.

542
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,279
Trains of thought
can be more varied,

543
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,615
more changeable,
more dynamic.

544
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,550
-I definitely experienced that.
-Yeah.

545
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:50,153
All right, you looked
not just at my brain

546
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:52,155
through the surface,
but you went deep inside.

547
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:54,057
 -Yeah.
 -What did you notice there?

548
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,059
We looked at a particular
brain network

549
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,995
 called the default mode network
 that seems to relate

550
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:01,364
 to our sense of self or ego.

551
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,399
 We've seen in other studies

552
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,435
 that during
 a psychedelic experience,

553
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:08,004
 that network
 is dramatically compromised.

554
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,406
 It shows a kind
 of disintegration and actually,

555
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,508
that process relates
quite strongly

556
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:16,112
to people's ego dissolution,
and yet after the experience,

557
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:19,082
 the network comes back
 as a kind of reset

558
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,050
 or a kind of rebooting
 of the network,

559
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:24,053
 and what we found your brain
 after ayahuasca,

560
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:26,990
 as predicted, was
 that your brain reset.

561
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,958
 The network
 became more cohesive,

562
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:32,295
 more integrated, more strongly
 connected within itself.

563
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:34,931
 Wow. Yeah, afterwards,
 I really did feel

564
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:36,599
 much more interested

565
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,369
with my identity, my past
and my future.

566
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,272
-Yeah.
-You asked me a lot of questions

567
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,108
before and after

568
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,311
about my insight
into experiences.

569
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:50,146
-Yeah.
-How did those compare?

570
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:53,182
Well, actually we saw something
really nice in those data.

571
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:56,085
So your ratings of insight
for the journey,

572
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:58,554
 the lower dose and then
 the higher dose with ayahuasca,

573
00:30:58,555 --> 00:31:02,425
what we saw was that
there was a graded increase

574
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:04,460
 in your levels of insight.

575
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:07,997
 Your score at baseline
 was 27.

576
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:11,234
 After the low-dose experience,
 it was 39.

577
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:14,938
 After the high-dose ceremony,
 it was 49.

578
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,040
 Wow, I definitely felt
 like the larger

579
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,142
 the ayahuasca dose,
 the more I considered

580
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,411
 -and learned about myself.
 -Yeah.

581
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,513
Well, Robin,
I'm glad that we were able

582
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:27,050
to do such a, you know,
in-the-environment-type study.

583
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,486
So thank you for coming all
the way out to Peru with me.

584
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:32,689
I really appreciate it,
and I hope that I helped.

585
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,290
Yeah, it's been
a great experience,

586
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:39,362
and I've learned a lot.

587
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:41,297
As I look back on it now,

588
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:43,599
I feel like my experience
with ayahuasca

589
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,069
was one of resistance.

590
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,404
 Instead of surrendering myself
 to its effects,

591
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:50,573
 I dipped in
 and then got scared,

592
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:52,275
 and I told myself,
 "It'll be all right.

593
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:54,077
 I'm not gonna die,"

594
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,346
 but I should've just gone in
 and through.

595
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,349
I did however learn a lot
about how to control anxiety,

596
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,652
that relinquishing control
and selfishness

597
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:06,022
can make it vanish,
but perhaps in doing so,

598
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:08,992
I lost the chance to experience
my mind operating

599
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,527
without the controls
and dampening

600
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:15,531
I'm so used to that
I'm more comfortable with.

601
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:18,401
Scientists like Robin
have managed to break through

602
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:21,537
tight legal restrictions
surrounding these substances

603
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:23,740
and have begun to find out
what they can teach us

604
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,408
about the mind.

605
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:28,277
Their findings so far
are just the beginning

606
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,214
of our understanding
of these powerful compounds,

607
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,183
which shows us how much
we have yet to learn

608
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:36,586
about the mind and brain.

609
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:42,191
And, as always,
thanks for watching.
