1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,259
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,499
And I'm in Anaheim at VidCon.
I hope to see some of you here, because I

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,699
like you guys.
But I can't marry all of you.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,449
But if I did put a ring on it, what is the
most precious thing you could make that ring

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,179
out of?
Silver, gold, platinum.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:26,169
Those are all fine, but I wanna know what
is the rarest, most scarce thing on Earth

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,829
that's stable and safe to wear I could make
that ring out of.

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,719
And I want it to be pure.
I'm talking elemental.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,279
Well, luckily, I recently went to the University
of Nottingham, home of Periodic Videos and

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,879
experimented with some elements.
First things first, zinc dissolved in mercury.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,199
This stuff is awesome, it's dense, it's heavy,
it's liquid metal.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,379
It's cool, but even cooler is human urine.
Thank you Neil.

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,239
Of course I am just kidding.
This is an aqueous solution of the metal vanadium.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:08,788
And when we mix vanadium in with the mercury
and the zinc, the mercury helps the zinc give

15
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:15,099
electrons to the vanadium.
And is it gains more and more electrons, it

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,579
changes colour.
We're looking for purple.

17
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,179
I love shaking this, it's crazy, it's like
throwing me off balance.

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:32,059
It's so heavy.
Look at that.

19
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,259
Thank you electrons.

20
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,748
Those colours were beautiful, but vanadium

21
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:43,048
is not that rare.
I wanna get something more precious.

22
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,328
And how about precious personally, like my dad?

23
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:52,328
He's a chemical engineer who specifically
works with and has a patent concerning one

24
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,128
element.
Sulphur.

25
00:01:55,129 --> 00:02:00,228
Of course a fun thing to do with sulphur is
to make it bark like a dog.

26
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,148
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna take a glass tube and fill it

27
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,228
with laughing gas, nitrous oxide.
We're gonna pour a little bit of water into

28
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,949
the tube to cushion and protect the tube and
then we're gonna pour in some liquid carbon

29
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,069
disulphide.
It's very volatile and will evaporate, giving

30
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:22,579
us a mixture of gases inside this tube.
Finally, I will light the top of the tube,

31
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,349
causing the carbon disulphide to burn.
And as it burns, the temperature and pressure

32
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,659
in the tube will increase, causing the reaction
to go faster and faster.

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,499
It'll accelerate and bark.

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,099
Wow.

35
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,459
And look at all the sulphur on the sides of the tube.

36
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,009
That reaction was fun and cool and colourful,
but we're way off track here.

37
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,849
Even though sulphur is precious and dear to
my heart, it's not that rare at all.

38
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:03,129
So let's get crazy and talk about astatine.
Astatine is so rare here on Earth that we

39
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,929
don't even know what it looks like.
If you were to try to get enough astatine

40
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,089
atoms together that you could see it with
your own eyes, it would instantly vaporise

41
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,139
itself because of its radioactive heat.
The fact that it's so radioactive means it

42
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,789
wouldn't be great as a ring, so let's move
on to something a little bit more standard

43
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,409
and see where it takes us.
Gold.

44
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:31,169
Gold, of course, is famous for its un-reactivity,
which is why it's a great way to store your

45
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,409
wealth.
If you have a lot of gold laying around, the

46
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,318
likelihood that it will combine with other
elements and dissolve or rust or corrode is

47
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,859
basically zero,
with the exception of some special solutions.

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,099
In particular, one discovered in 1300s with
the fancy name "aqua regia."

49
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,458
It's made out of hydrochloric acid and nitric
acid and we're about to make some right now

50
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,249
thanks to Neil from Periodic Videos.
Of course, we're using this fume cover, because

51
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,349
the fumes that come off the nitric acid are
quite dangerous.

52
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:08,349
It's the gas NO2 and if you inhale it, nitric
acid forms in your lungs.

53
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,769
So instead of doing that, let's put some gold
in aqua regia.

54
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,419
We're just gonna use this ancient priceless
Egyptian relic.

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,208
Let's go ahead and try this out.
As the gold dissolves, what we wind up with

56
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:27,318
in the evaporating dish is chloroauric acid.
Auric coming from aurum, the Latin word for

57
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,759
gold, which is why gold's symbol on the periodic
table is Au.

58
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,038
It's really sad to watch that gold dissolve away.

59
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,799
I wish there was a way for us to just make
other things into gold.

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,959
Now I know what you're thinking.
"Michael, that's alchemy."

61
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,098
But alchemy is quite real.
In today's particle accelerators we can smash

62
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:52,918
particles together, creating elements.
At the accelerator collider at GSI they can

63
00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:01,759
create gold by smashing particles together
at a rate of 2 million gold atoms every second.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,859
That's pretty cool, right?
Well, as you know, atoms are incredibly small.

65
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,808
They're so small that even though GSI can
make 2 million new gold atoms every single

66
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:19,658
second, were they to leave the machine on
at that rate for 50 million years they would

67
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:28,219
only produce 1 gram of gold.
Gold is rare and precious and expensive.

68
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:35,019
But gold is 40% more common than iridium.
And iridium is incredibly resilient.

69
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,138
It doesn't dissolve in aqua regia and it's
not even attacked by molten metals or silicates

70
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:46,448
at high temperature, which is nice and ..., but
not as pretty as cerium, which reacts at high

71
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,258
temperature to form beautiful little sparkles.
As we continue our journey to discover the

72
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,099
rarest thing to make a ring out of, we've
got to discuss osmium.

73
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,039
This stuff is so rare there's fewer than one
part per billion in our Earth's crust.

74
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,179
But we're not done yet.
Iridium and osmium are both in the platinum

75
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,109
family.
And if you take a look at platinum, it's much

76
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,899
more common than both iridium and osmium,
but there's something neat that I think we

77
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,019
should consider.
Stable isotopes.

78
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,739
And it's one of the isotopes of platinum that
will finish our story.

79
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,079
Platinum-190.
It's a stable isotope with half-life of over

80
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,479
billion years that's non-reactive.
It's fits all our criteria.

81
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,919
A ring made of the scarcest, naturally
occurring stable, non-reactive thing.

82
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,399
So hey, it would be an awesome ring.
Now, you're probably wondering, "Michael,

83
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,468
why did you experiment with vanadium, sulphur,
gold and cerium?"

84
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:48,378
Well, here's what's interesting.
Take a look at the periodic table and there's

85
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,818
symbols.
Ta-da!

86
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,798
Vsauce.

87
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,799
And as always,

88
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,020
thanks for watching.
