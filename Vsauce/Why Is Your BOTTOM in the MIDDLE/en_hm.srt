00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,779
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,789
A human, running like a quadruped, is creepy.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,659
Artist Rui Martins created this animation

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,218
about a year ago. 127 years ago

5
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:21,019
Eadweard Muybridge shot these real images
of a child with infantile paralysis

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,639
walking on all fours. Walking upright

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,799
looks less unnatural, our bodies are
particularly well suited for it. It's one

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,639
of the things

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,009
the bulbous and prominent

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,939
human bottom helps us do.
But let's get to the bottom

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,019
of a linguistic mystery. Why is the bottom

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,159
called a bottom, when it's in the middle of the body?

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,229
Your feet and legs are almost always

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,269
at the same level or below your bottom.
I mean, except for

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,839
Navasana, the yoga boat pose, your bottom is

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,308
anything but the actual bottom of your body.

17
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:04,048
Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,798
answer, but there are butt loads of cool things to learn

19
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,039
about butts. A buttload is not just a
joke amount. It is a very specific

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,188
unit of measurement. Historically, it was
used to describe the capacity

21
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,449
of a wine cask. A butt is about

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,519
477 litres, which means,

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,688
given the average volume of solid waste

24
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,779
the rectum holds, when a person says they have a

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,368
buttload of something... Technically,

26
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,639
they are saying they have enough of that thing to fill

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,408
3,200 butts. Using the word

28
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,669
bottom to refer to your posterior is relatively new.

29
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,589
Cedric Watts has presented evidence that
in the late 16th century bottom could

30
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,129
connote the human rear end,

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,739
but the first published use wasn't until 1794

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,029
in Erasmus Darwin's 'Zoonomia'.

33
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,179
The word bottom comes from words meaning

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,419
'foundation', 'the lowest level'.
But when standing or sitting,

35
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,488
the soles of your feet are more properly

36
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,199
at the bottom, and, sure enough, sole also means

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,509
'foundation', 'bottom'.
What's going on here is probably a combination

38
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,579
of torso-centric thinking and euphemism.

39
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,639
Bottom is a nice word for a sometimes

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,059
dirty part and your bottom is the bottom
of your digestive tract and

41
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,719
the bottom of your torso, the bottom of your body,

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,429
if you exclude your limbs. For Prince Randian,

43
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,419
a man born in 1871 in British Guiana,

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,389
the bottom was the bottom.

45
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,399
Because of tetra-amelia syndrome, he was born with no

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,378
limbs at all. In 1889 P.T. Barnum brought him
to the United States to perform

47
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,439
in carnivals. And you can see him
light a cigarette with no arms

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,628
or feet in the 1932 film

49
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:10,039
"Freaks". Bottom is just one of many words
we have for the posterior,

50
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,378
the rear, the backside, derriÃ¨re, bum,

51
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,339
buns or, in reference to its round shape, moon.

52
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,429
Which is why exposing your bare buttocks

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,238
is known as mooning, an offensive gesture.

54
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,689
The earliest known instance of mooning was
recorded by Flavius Josephus. It occurred

55
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,999
in 66 A.D.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,298
A Roman soldier mooned

57
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,659
a group of Jews headed to a temple in Jerusalem.

58
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,699
His act of mooning spawned a riot and the subsequent

59
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,208
overreaction on the part of the Roman military led to the

60
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,518
deaths of thousands of people.

61
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,809
If you get mooned you will,

62
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,738
just like a guy who died September 14th,
1865 and is now buried in West Laurens, New York,

63
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,658
Seymour Butts. At least he didn't
share his name with a former

64
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,499
representative of New Hampshire's

65
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,169
second district. The word 'bum'

66
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,109
predates the use of the word bottom for the rear by quite

67
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,758
a lot. It's believed that the word bum
originated as an onomatopoeia for the

68
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,458
sound of

69
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,069
buttocks slapping against a flat surface.

70
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,629
Seriously. Lazily sitting around on your

71
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,948
bum all day gave American English the word

72
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,299
bum, a loafer, an idle person.

73
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,388
And bum's connotation of uselessness, poor quality

74
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,219
caused it to lend itself in the late 1960s to the word

75
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,829
'bummer', an experience that was worthless - 

76
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,579
a letdown. But to be clear, your butt

77
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,149
is a bottom, kind of. It's a bum

78
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,069
but it is not a bummer.
Your butt is magnificent, an example

79
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,629
of what makes the human body so different.

80
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,609
Its shape comes from the
gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles as

81
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,899
well as a layer

82
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,659
of fat.
That layer of fat makes the bottom a great cushion

83
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,758
for sitting. Other animals have to sit

84
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,369
by resting weight on their legs
because they lack the nice

85
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:23,049
bulbous butt of the human. Evolutionary
psychology suggests that our attraction to full

86
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,309
firm bottoms on potential mates was probably

87
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,659
naturally selected. People in the past who liked

88
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,749
big ol' bottoms probably spread their genes quite

89
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,929
well. They probably had a lot of
reproductive success because the calle

90
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,008
pigeon bottom

91
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:41,168
is a sign of health and youth. A bottom full of shapely fat

92
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,739
is a great energy reserve.
That energy can come in quite handy if

93
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,829
food suddenly become scarce or during pregnancy

94
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,029
or breast feeding. There's a great reddit
thread you can read if you'd like this

95
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,359
evolutionary psychology approach wrapped up in a

96
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,418
Sir Mix-a-Lot's "I like big butts" package.

97
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:05,599
Because we are bipedal in order to keep
our torsos balanced while moving

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,429
we require relatively giant and prominent

99
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,299
muscles in our bottoms, muscles that are so prominent

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,159
we have, compared to other apes,
very defined intergluteal clefts.

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,749
Butt cracks. This makes

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,079
certain hygienic practices more common in humans

103
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,418
than other animals. But those prominent muscles

104
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,599
are worth it. Compared to horses and other quadrupeds

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,849
humans can reach impressive long-distance

106
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,959
aerobic endurance running speeds.

107
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,568
This is Katarina Johnson-Thompson,
an Olympic athlete from Great Britain

108
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:48,818
and an excellent example of the fact that humans

109
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,499
are the running animal.

110
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,199
Hi Michael.

111
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,859
Hi Katarina. Take a look at this.

112
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,698
I'll make it brief, but above and beyond
other animals, humans can:

113
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,739
sweat to efficiently dump body heat,
we have short toes to provide more efficient

114
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,318
force over long periods of running,
our short neck ligaments keep our head perfectly

115
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,929
stable when running,

116
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,809
our uniquely well-developed
Achilles tendon converts elastic energy into

117
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,649
kinetic energy

118
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,209
very well and our tall narrow waists
provide great counter rotation as our legs

119
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,239
swing backwards and forwards.
I like how PZ Myers

120
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,478
sums it up: "Over long distances, the average

121
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,329
speed sustained by a horse is less
than that of the human,

122
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,399
which means that a well-trained
conditioned human being

123
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,839
can keep up with, or even outrun, a horse

124
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,619
if the race is sustained long enough."

125
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,509
For this reason endurance running is
still practiced by a few people on Earth

126
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:53,079
as a form of hunting and it may have
been vitally important to prehistoric people.

127
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,569
Before domesticated animals and
projectile weapons and traps,

128
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,299
humans caught animals for food in an incredibly

129
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,609
athletic way. David Attenborough
documented this practice fantastically.

130
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,269
You should

131
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,139
definitely watch this clip. An animal
will sprint away from running human

132
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,739
hunters but eventually

133
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,049
have to rest. Humans, on the other hand,
though slow in the short run

134
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,939
can keep going. Like the tortoise, they eventually beat

135
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,839
the hare and can walk right up to the
exhausted and overheated

136
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,289
animal to kill it. We don't have

137
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,839
dangerous claws or massive teeth and
we can pretty much

138
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,839
only outsprint vegetables.

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,548
But, in the long run, thanks to things like our impressive

140
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:42,968
butts, we have superior endurance

141
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,369
when it comes to running. It may be called a bottom

142
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,519
but it's at the top of the list of things
that make the human body amazing.

143
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,739
This video was inspired by Sport Relief.

144
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,959
A great cause that uses sport to raise
money for vulnerable people here in the

145
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,459
UK and abroad.

146
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,949
Check the description of this video to
learn more and watch their interactive

147
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,279
video about how you

148
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,129
can help out and get involved.
But wait a second,

149
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,639
if our bodies are so well developed
for endurance running

150
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,719
how come we don't all run marathons?

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,329
How come we don't all enjoy running

152
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,469
or do a lot of it? Well, the thing is all of
this running specialization was

153
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,839
naturally selected

154
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,469
because it helped our prehistoric ancestors survive.

155
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,369
Actually enjoying all of that running was not
naturally selected, it was just a part of their

156
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,809
daily lives. But that doesn't mean that today you can't

157
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,179
get off your butt, use your butt and be proud of it.

158
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,739
The next time someone calls you a butthead say

159
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,799
"thanks, I always knew my head was a
superlative object that set me apart from

160
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,379
the animal kingdom."

161
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,148
Katarina

162
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,068
And as always,

163
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,189
thanks for watching.
