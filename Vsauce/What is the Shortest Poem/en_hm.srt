00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:03,658
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
I am in Green Bank,

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,778
West Virginia. Pocahontas County.
And my favorite word

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:11,639
is ...

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,819
I learned it from Big Bird and it's not so much a word

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,899
as the alphabet, if you try to pronounce it

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,839
like a word.
It's a neat trick, almost poetic.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,438
But what counts as poetry?
How short can something be and still be

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,289
a poem?
What is the shortest poem

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,459
in the world and why does knowing it

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,289
matter?

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,259
Okay, now I am in Charlottesville, Virginia

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,419
in a hotel room.
I'm on the road this week.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,419
Take a look at my amazingly fancy

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,519
set up.
A popular contender for the shortest

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,639
story in the world is apocryphally

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,549
attributed to Ernest Hemingway.
It contains only six

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,009
words.
"For sale. Baby shoes.

18
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,779
Never worn."
A popular contender for the title of world's

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,609
shortest poem and the one honored at
WorldsShortestPoem.com

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,829
is a clever couplet attributed to Strickland

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,179
Gillilan, titled "on the Antiquity

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,258
of Microbes" or sometimes just

23
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:27,978
"Fleas".
It goes like this: " 'Fleas' /

24
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:33,199
Adam / Had 'em"
But shorter

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,779
rhyming couplets are possible.
Gyles Brandreth

26
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,169
wrote the very cute "Ode to a Goldfish."

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,599
"Oh, wet / pet"

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,059
Muhammad Ali composed an even shorter
rhyming couplet when he spoke at Harvard

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,369
in 1975.
Using just

30
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,469
4 letters, his poem poignantly sums up the power of

31
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,829
role models and leaders.
The idea that as one man climbs

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,739
the rest are lifted up.
The poem is simply

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,619
"me / we"

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,379
But a poem doesn't need to rhyme

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,429
or contain multiple words.
A poem is simply a type of literary

36
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,559
art that uses aesthetic or rhythmic
properties of a language to mean

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,669
more than it normally would.
With that definition in mind take a look at my

38
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,559
favorite

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,548
one word poem by Aram Saroyan.

40
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,659
The word light with an extra

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,539
"gh".
The poem became controversial because the

42
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,958
NEA paid him $500

43
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,259
for the poem.
Critics berated it for its simplicity

44
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,049
but that only made it more famous and popular.

45
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,839
Lighght. It's fun to type and it's fun to say because

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,779
what sound does the "gh" in the word "light"

47
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,249
really make?
Is this a lighter,

48
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,779
fluffier extended version of light or is it a

49
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,149
gargled, choking one?
We can get shorter

50
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,848
one letter poems.
Two of my favorites are

51
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,039
" 'fit' / n" and

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,208
" 'nought' / t".
Of course,

53
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,238
should the title count when measuring the length

54
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,579
of a poem?
Well, maybe.

55
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,579
I like Geof Huth's two letter amalgam poem.

56
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,878
The letter L with the letter Y on top of it,
making a brand new character.

57
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,299
Now, of course an L and a Y is a great way to make an

58
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,079
adverb.
It's the difference between strange and strangely.

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,458
Here, in this very poem,
we have the difference between

60
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,249
you and what you do in one

61
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,949
simple shape.
Before they stopped

62
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,469
tracking the record, the Guinness Book of
World Records considered Aram Saroyan

63
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,769
the

64
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,799
author of the world's shortest poem.

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,999
Here it is.
The letter "m"

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,329
with an extra hump.
Is it

67
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,818
a letter or an image?
Some have called it

68
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,259
a close up of an alphabet being born.

69
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,348
Its cells still in the process of dividing the

70
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,629
"m" and the "n", not quite separated.
But from what I've read,

71
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,098
in my opinion, the shortest poem

72
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:34,499
ever, the shortest use of language
aesthetically, arhythmically to mean more

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,689
than the word itself

74
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,339
is jwcurry's composition of the lower case letter

75
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,449
"i", dotted with his own

76
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,269
fingerprint.
The fingerprint makes it

77
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,699
his. "I" means me

78
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,679
but this one can only mean him.

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,959
For fun, let's talk about situations in which language

80
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,459
isn't even used.
We are entering the realm

81
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,989
of poetry.
What Geof Huth calls

82
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,029
a moment when a writer writes

83
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,159
nothing instead of anything.

84
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,159
R. W. Watkins composed a poem

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,409
that only suggested language.

86
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,579
In reality, it simply contained places

87
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,069
where language could go.
There are also plenty of

88
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,929
empty musical compositions.
Songs

89
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,119
that are nothing, simply silence.
John Denver even composed one.

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,879
His "Ballad of Richard Nixon" is silence

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,809
and you can buy it in the iTunes Store for 99 cents.

92
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,008
But who cares?
Is knowing the world's shortest poem

93
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:52,859
just a neat piece of trivia, a cool thing
to tell your friends but in the end

94
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,149
a useless pub fact?
I mean,

95
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,719
the Guinness Book of World Records has
stopped compiling records for

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,159
artistic briefness.
What you're about to see is possibly

97
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,349
the shortest concert ever

98
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,679
put on. It was done by the White Stripes
in Newfoundland in 2007.

99
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,989
Here it comes.

100
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,469
And there it went. That's all.

101
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,549
The Guinness Book of World Records
refused to recognize

102
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,068
that concert as being the shortest
because they said, quote,

103
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,098
"The nature of competing to make
something

104
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:34,158
the 'shortest' by its very nature
trivializes the activity

105
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:39,128
being carried, as such we have been
forced to cease listing records for the

106
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:40,219
shortest song,

107
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,929
shortest poem and indeed the shortest concert."

108
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,348
Trivializes?
Maybe.

109
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:53,429
But we can say and sing and write and
draw a lot of powerful

110
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,888
things, regardless of what authority recognizes

111
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,179
its size or lack thereof.
Appreciating the power carried by

112
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,818
even the tiniest poem is a great way to
put into perspective just how

113
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:10,429
cool that is.
When he died,

114
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,489
Fernando Pessoa left behind a chest

115
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,959
full of his thoughts and experiences written down.

116
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,408
Decades after his death they were
published into "The Book

117
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,418
of Disquiet."
His thoughts and experiences

118
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:29,839
didn't die along with him, he had written
them down, he had narrated them

119
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,339
and in this book he discusses the power of narration

120
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,818
compared to simply existing, living,

121
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,888
seeing, YOLO-ing.
He said,

122
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:43,179
"Direct experience is an evasion,

123
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,388
a hiding place for those without any

124
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,348
imagination. To narrate is to create,

125
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:53,408
while to live is merely

126
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:57,079
to be lived."
Anyone can live

127
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,649
a life.
His question would be what have you said

128
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,739
about it.
Even the world's shortest

129
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,269
poem is still a comment, a narration.

130
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,359
Even the world's shortest poem, even

131
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,339
a silence that's purposeful and means something

132
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,880
can be mind-blowingly gigantic.
