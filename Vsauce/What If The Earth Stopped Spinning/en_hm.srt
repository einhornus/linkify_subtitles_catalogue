1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,639
Hey, Vsauce. Michael Here. The Earth is spinning

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,588
and we are spinning along with it. But what if the

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,609
Earth suddenly stopped spinning? Well first of all, you would

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,649
gain weight. But that would be the least

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,909
of your worries. The spin of our planet is important

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,118
and literally giving you the time of your life.

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,169
At the equator, the surface of Earth, and

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,569
everything on it, is spinning around at 465 metres a second.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,269
As you move closer to the poles you don't have to move as quickly to complete

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,199
Earth's daily rotation. Here in San Francisco, the Earth is driving me

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,968
east at 368 metres per second. If I could float above the surface

12
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,078
independent of the Earth's rotation, the Earth would spin underneath me

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,328
this quickly. Pretty cool. But, of course, when I jump straight up into the air,

14
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,659
the Earth doesn't move underneath me because I continued to spin with it.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,798
We are all spinning with the Earth and that is why slamming on a set of

16
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,669
magical planetary breaks that caused everything

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:16,179
classically called Earth to stop spinning would be catastrophic.

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,079
Immediately everything that wasn't

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,798
Earth, and wasn't safely at the poles, would continue moving, as it had been,

20
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,469
and be flung due east at more than a thousand miles an hour

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:32,139
You wouldn't be flung into space because escape velocity is 24,800 mph (39911.731 km/h)

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,478
but your body would

23
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,139
instantly become a 9.5 inch calibre bullet.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,449
Well, really more of a supersonic tumbleweed.

25
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,199
Because the atmosphere would more gradually slow down, people in airplanes

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,989
assuming they could navigate the resulting storms, might have a better

27
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,298
chance of surviving.

28
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,179
Astronauts aboard the ISS would fare even better.

29
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,868
But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for them

30
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,368
down on the ground. Runways would just be

31
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,859
entrances to the new planet-sized graveyard,

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,968
created by the no longer spinning Earth

33
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:13,869
People really really near the poles might be okay but

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,039
only at first. Gusts of wind, as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation,

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,068
would blast, pass the surface and up into the sky forming worldwide storms

36
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,518
of unprecedented magnitude. The friction alone,

37
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,108
caused by the now stopped Earth colliding with these winds, would be enough to cause

38
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,358
massive fires,

39
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,498
unparalleled erosion and damage to anything strong enough to stay put

40
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:40,568
after the initial braking. The Sun would seem to freeze in the sky as days

41
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:46,339
became not 24 hours long but 365 days long.

42
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,358
Without spinning innards, Earth's protective magnetic field would cease to exist

43
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,658
and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation from the Sun.

44
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,068
The oceans would surge onto land in tsunamis kilometers high and wash over nearly

45
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,268
all dry land, before migrating to the poles,

46
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,078
where gravity is stronger, no longer held to the ocean basins by the inertia

47
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:11,699
Earth's spin gave them,

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,308
until Earth itself, no longer bulging an extra 42 kilometers around its equator, because

49
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:18,438
of its rotation

50
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,619
slowly compressed into a more perfect sphere

51
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,339
than it is now. Possibly allowing the oceans to eventually return somewhat.

52
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,208
That is what would occur

53
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,638
if it actually happened. It won't actually happen but

54
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,718
woah, its rotation is slowing down.

55
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,168
More on that later. First, if the Earth really is spinning so quickly,

56
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,028
why can't we feel it? Why doesn't the Earth's rotation

57
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:47,248
make us dizzy? Well, lucky for us,

58
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:51,698
the change in velocity is just too gradual. The Earth is too huge.

59
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,858
It's like driving in a car that takes

60
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,738
6 hours and six thousand miles to make one

61
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,768
left turn. It's not sudden enough to register

62
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,259
with our senses. But that change in velocity

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,289
is real and it makes us weigh

64
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:15,298
less, because of inertia. On our spinning planet your velocity is constantly

65
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,759
changing but always

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,688
tangential to the circular path you were being dragged along.

67
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:24,388
Now, because inertia is a property of matter, which includes

68
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,719
your body, without a force acting upon us we would

69
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,239
slowly leave the surface of Earth.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,589
Luckily, the Earth is exerting a force on us. A centre-seeking,

71
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,049
centripetal force, delivered by gravity.

72
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,318
The centripetal force required to keep you along a circular path with Earth is subtracted

73
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,539
from Earth's total gravitational pull on you.

74
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,089
The remaining force simply pushes you down,

75
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,529
toward the centre of the Earth - it gives you weight.

76
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,698
At the equator, if the Earth didn't spin, and no centripetal force was required to

77
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:58,638
keep you

78
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,239
with the Earth, you would weigh 0.3 percent

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,508
more than you currently do. If Earth spun you around

80
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:11,408
17 times faster than it currently does, all of its gravitational force

81
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:15,038
would go toward centripetal force fighting against your inertia

82
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,779
and you would be weightless.

83
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,258
So here's a diet idea. Hope that the Earth starts

84
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,779
spinning faster and go back for guilt-free seconds.

85
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,459
Seconds.

86
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,668
We know exactly how long

87
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,688
a second is. The outermost electron

88
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:39,539
of an atom of cesium 133 is alone

89
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,209
When the atom is undisturbed, only the nucleus

90
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,869
interacts with this outermost electron, tickling it

91
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,399
regularly and rapidly between two levels.

92
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:56,899
After 9,192,631,770

93
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:03,719
oscillations between those two levels, one second has passed.

94
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,079
Exactly.

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,948
That is literally the definition of a second.

96
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,908
We can measure and count those oscillations.

97
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:16,538
It's how atomic clocks work. Making atomic clocks,

98
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:22,619
the most accurate measurement device ever built by humans, to measure anything.

99
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,829
We can't define

100
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:30,468
a second more simply, as say, 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a day

101
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:34,119
because of Earth's spin.

102
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,559
It's too irregular. Little changes

103
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,089
in the distribution of mass on Earth, caused by earthquakes or melting ice

104
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,079
or man-made dams or technically

105
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,938
even you walking up stairs or downstairs,

106
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,519
cause Earth's rotational speed to change.

107
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,279
Like a figure skater moving their arms further away from or closer to their bodies.

108
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,848
Now add on top of that the fact that tides, caused by the Moon,

109
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:04,068
drag against Earth's rotation and you wind up with an

110
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:07,068
unstable rotation speed that is

111
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,068
predominately slowing down.

112
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,799
Now, these changes are incredibly incredibly slight, but over time

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,218
they add up. In 140 million years,

114
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:23,119
a day on earth will not be 24 hours long,

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,658
it will be 25. That might not sound like much

116
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,288
but in order to do important things, like deliver accurate GPS information,

117
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,679
we need a more accurate timekeeping device

118
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,019
than that. So, as a solution

119
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,188
scientists keep the pace of seconds using atomic clocks,

120
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,258
TAI time. And other scientists

121
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,899
measure the changing speed of Earth's rotation by observing distant stars

122
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,359
and quasars. Now, every few months they find out just how behind or ahead

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,258
Earth is running, and if it's getting too close to being a second

124
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,568
off, they decide to add or subtract the second from the current year.

125
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:06,679
The result is the time used almost everywhere,

126
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,888
including your phone: UTC

127
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,158
Since this system began in 1972

128
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,399
25 leap seconds have been added.

129
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,589
What this means is that clock time is,

130
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,758
and has to be, a manufactured

131
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,329
product with upgrades and tune ups administered

132
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,098
periodically, after defects

133
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:34,379
are noticed. The time we give to now

134
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,038
and the future is only ever

135
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,338
approximate. That's weird

136
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,439
but it's also entirely not weird

137
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,569
As Demetrios Matsakis, the Chief Scientist of Time Services for the US

138
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,929
Naval Observatory puts it,

139
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,979
"we save lives

140
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,599
and we end lives. We add time and we can take time away,

141
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,619
but in both cases we do so without completely

142
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,708
understanding exactly what life is,

143
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:09,629
or what time is."

144
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,539
Regardless, thank you for spending some of yours with me...

145
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,059
And as always,

146
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,380
thanks for watching.
