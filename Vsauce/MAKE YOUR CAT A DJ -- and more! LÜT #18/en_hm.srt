1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,299
Bake two pies at the same time and then
relax on

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,398
pancake pillows.
It's episode 18

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,209
of LÜT.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,548
You can also choose to use emoticon
pillows or a True Blood necklace.

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,999
If you're a neat freak, protect your tables
with Portal 2 warning sign coasters.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,288
And then store your photos on an SD card,

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,198
or in a SD card photo album.

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,098
Personally, I just stick one cool pic on my
laptop lid to make it look see-through

9
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,499
or to make myself look X-rayed or bikini-clad.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,209
And these spatulas will make your cooking more super

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,468
hero. Deal yourself hand of nostalgia
with these space invader playing cards

12
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:45,279
and graduate from Bucky Balls too Bucky

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,679
Cubes, a bunch of cube magnets only
outdone by the book

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,429
HTML for babies. Teach your child letters
and colours while also reminding them

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,279
of proper HTML mark-up.
Vat19's H2O candle kit lets you create

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,218
a flame

17
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:04,437
that appears to sit right on top of water,
which is the best kind of light to play

18
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,179
by when messing around with you Fisher
Price classic toy

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,649
keychains.
Thrown on a steampunk skeleton t-shirt

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,688
and escape the stress of smartphones 
with John's phone.

21
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,688
It accepts a SIM card, but all it can do

22
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,959
is call people and receive calls.
Due to its simplicity

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,758
its call time lasts six hours and when
it's not in use its battery lasts

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,258
3 weeks.
I met PureKatherine

25
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:32,709
in Chicago last month.
Now, she will cover your shoes or

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,578
anything else you'd like in glitter,
a perfectly trade secret protected coat of

27
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,199
glitter that doesn't shed

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,999
off.
These Batman clothespins also keep things secure

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,069
and this skateboard bench is great for
your bedroom.

30
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,148
Here's a robot you can control with an app
on your phone.

31
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:52,389
Oh look, cats love it.
But if you cat loves scratching,

32
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,859
let him be a DJ and scratch on a
scratching post turntable.

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,929
But if your cat dies, that's okay, because
the airport in Amsterdam have trash cans

34
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,478
for your used pets.

35
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,609
Just kidding. PET means polyethylene
terephthalate, a polymer used in liquid

36
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,779
containers.
But, if you're hungry,

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,189
check out Exotic Meat Market.
This service sells

38
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,458
legal meat for you to cook and eat.
Raccoon meat,

39
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,429
llama, bacon made from a black bear, crocodile,

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,509
kangaroo and even lion meat.

41
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,189
That's right. For $100 you
can buy three burgers

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,979
made out of lion meat.
Lions are not endangered

43
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,589
and these burgers are made from lions
raised in Illinois.

44
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,579
The only part that's a little bit weird is
that when you eat lion

45
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,549
you're eating cat.
Okay, now it's time for the free thing.

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,779
I'm gonna let you guys in on a little bit of a Vsauce

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,958
secret. FakeNameGenerator.com.

48
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,779
This website will give you a person's
name, it'll make up their address, it'll

49
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,169
make up all kinds of data about them every
time you refresh the page,

50
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,689
but what's fun is that it also generates a
pronounceable,

51
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,789
available ".com" domain name.

52
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,658
And it's this service, by sitting there
and pressing refresh over and over again

53
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:08,869
that

54
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,299
I used to find Vsauce.com.

55
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,579
I said that's the perfect name and hence

56
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,619
here we are today.
Thank you FakeNameGenerator.com

57
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,499
for giving us Vsauce.
And to all of you out there:

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,419
As always,

59
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:31,539
thank you for watching.

60
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,619
Vsauce, welcome to my hotel room.
As you can see, episode 18 of LÜT is back

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,009
up. I'm not really sure what happened to it,
I think it may have been the

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,598
international police.
They've been after me all weekend

63
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,789
for stealing the hearts of women

64
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,419
all over Madrid. Seriously, I've got like
a dozen of 'em in this bag stuck in the

65
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,839
mini fridge, it's really gross,

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,628
but that shouldn't get in the way of
a bonus item I think that I just found last

67
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:57,079
night.

68
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,408
A terra cotta pot.
Just kidding. It's also a grill

69
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,079
and the grilling surfaces circles mean
that the grill marks on your food

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
are polka dots.
Pretty fun, right?
