1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:09,699
Here's a guy whose mouth can sound like
an engine.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,599
And this woman can be a human

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,099
car alarm.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,109
But are those the best mouth noises

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,199
of all-time?
And better yet, what happened to my beard?

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,049
Well, to figure out the answer to this one,
you'll have to wait for 'The Key of Awesome's'

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,758
new music video on Thursday.

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,049
But don't let it distract you, ladies.
Let's focus on the mouth

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,369
and mouth noises and the best of all time.
All aboard the boat.

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,988
Here's an old man who can do a monkey and

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:42,599
a horse.
On the aquatic side, here's

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,109
a dolphin woman.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,519
This guy can mimic the sound of a pistol reloading.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,039
And if you want something wetter,

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:04,659
this kid opens and pours a can of coke.

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,609
When things get awkward, call over Fletcher901

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:17,239
who can give you some great cricket
noises to fill the silence.

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,769
Competitive whistelers

19
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,459
are incredible.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,379
One of the neatest

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,509
whistle tricks I've seen is the ability
to whistle through two or more

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,719
openings in your mouth, so you can make
multiple tones and harmonize

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:40,259
with yourself.

24
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:53,619
Of course, beat boxers are some of the most famous
noisemakers on YouTube.

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,658
Some newer clips

26
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,978
show beat boxers during dub step sounds,
like Reeps One.

27
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:08,978
Links, by the way, to all these noises are in 
the description below.

28
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:20,759
Also worth a listen is Mastamicbeatbox.

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,969
And Slizzer.

30
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,429
I mean, look how much fun this guy's having.
While you're jamming to that, I wanna

31
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,559
invite you into my own little

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,559
experiment. On Thursday, the next Vsauce video
on this channel will come out at

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,539
exactly

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,969
6 p.m. Eastern.
The first 100 people to get there and comment the word

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,009
"Boooyerz" will get a YouTube message specially

36
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,799
from me.
So you have to be there right at 6 p.m.

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,839
Let's see what happens.

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,719
And as always,

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,800
thanks for watching.
