00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,128
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
and if you need more DONG

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:07,139
don't worry, because I'm bringing you
more things you could do online now, guys.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,669
"JaydenMarkAnderson" recommended Clubcreate,

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,919
where you can make your own remixes right
inside your browser.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,308
As we listen to a song I made this morning, check out

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,729
LYTRO. It's a camera that records a scene's entire

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,599
light field, so it can be refocused
after the fact. Just click

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,759
and see the results. On the simpler side,
"mynameizLachlan" brings us

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,379
Small Man Chases Cursor, which is exactly

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,549
that. "DYLZAL" keeps it real with
SelfControlFreak.com, where this guy

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,379
points

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,259
where you move your mouse and when you
move your mouse towards his face

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,729
swats it away. "CaptainFsh" showed us a
sweet way to calculate your age if you

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,378
lived on other planets.

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,099
Venus rotates on its axis so slowly that
even though I'd 41 Venus years old there,

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,769
I'd only be 38 Venus days old.
For some creativity

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,769
you've got to try Reimagine - The Game,
if you haven't already. "Dadakara100"

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,349
recommended it and every level

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,669
is a whole new box of weird fun. If you want to
slow things down and get dramatic like

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,899
"SillyFirecracker,"

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,839
use One Chance, a game where the world will

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,709
end in six days and you have to decide how
to spend it. I played the entire game

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,868
last night and it was incredibly
emotional, especially

24
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,139
because after I finished it
I checked out Dear Photograph,

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,139
a site where people take photos from
their childhood, revisit the locations

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,879
and hold the picture up to match.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,059
Their messages and memories are amazing.
If zombie defense strategy is more

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,349
your style, check out "MrFishguy4"
four

29
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,828
and Rebuild,
a turn-based game where you organize land-use,

30
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,798
exploratory campaigns and cross your
fingers that you keep the survivors

31
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,478
alive and the human race

32
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,099
flourishing. Finally, YourFonts.com.
On this site you can download a template

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,429
to

34
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,758
write on and then scan and upload.
The site will turn your

35
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,688
own handwriting into your very own
computer font. Nice.

36
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:00,579
So there you go. A bunch of cool things
you can do online now guys.

37
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,548
Hey, great show, Michael.
Wait,

38
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,099
are you Kevin from Vsauce?
Yeah, how's it going?

39
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,689
It is fantastic to finally meet you face-to-face.
Hey, you too. What brings you here?

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,519
Well, I just wanted to announce a brand
new episode of Mind Blow over on

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,339
Vsauce2.

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,598
Right, right. Mind Blow on Vsauce2, because
we're finally giving both channels an

43
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,519
identity.
Yeah.

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,359
Vsauce is where I'm gonna be with funny
stuff, products and geeky pranks.

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,449
Yeah, and Vsauce2 is going to be full of
mind-blowing science,

46
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,229
facts and plenty of weirdos.
And riddles, right?

47
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,439
So go click right here to watch
Mind Blow on Vsauce2 if you haven't

because, guys, it's a great thing to do online.

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,939
GDONG? Shhhhh.

51
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,899
As always,

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,580
thanks for watching.
