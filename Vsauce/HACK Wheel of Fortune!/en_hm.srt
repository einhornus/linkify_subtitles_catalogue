00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,068
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
and today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:08,768
DONGS.
Things you can do online now guys.
First of all,

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:12,729
"danceromg577" brings up GogLogo.com

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,298
where you can make your own Google
looking home page with whatever text you

5
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:16,948
want.

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,538
Or be like the "Thetom5000" and take
control of the wheel of fortune board.

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,069
Make up the hint,
use underscores for blanks and

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,118
ta-da.
They actually look pretty good.

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,319
Atom.Smasher[.org] has a bunch of others,
like this marquee.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,369
Then keep being sneaky like "cheseeh"
and sleuth around with no legs

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,558
as the man with the invisible trousers.
The surface you're on determines how

12
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:42,148
gravity

13
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,788
works, so use it to your advantage to get
to places you normally couldn't reach.

14
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:50,038
"MrsLilSensation" showed me 'Loved.'

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,049
A confrontational guide makes it uneasy
and being a good boy

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,198
or a good girl evolves the world
differently than being bad.

17
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,029
The humming drone in the background makes
it even more powerful.

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,359
But for something more puzzle based,
check out Tealy

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,969
and Orangey. The arrow keys control
each ball at the exact same time in the

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,719
same way,

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,728
but their worlds can be different, so watch out.

22
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,749
Now, if you want variety, try "NoTrollzAllowed's"

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,908
'I wanna win.'
Every level is a new type of puzzle.

24
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,989
Chess, search, a shell game,

25
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,579
brickbreaker, aiming.
It goes on and on and on. Speaking of variety,

26
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,478
"Left2Kill" showed off 'BoxCar2D,'
an evolution simulator similar to a screen

27
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,548
saver I once showed.

28
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:38,078
It's a sight where objects are randomly
generated and then left on a track

29
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,379
to see how far they move.
At the end of a generation

30
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,559
the computer takes the ones that moved
the furthest and combines them in random

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,118
ways,

32
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,639
like they're having kids.
You can alter the occurrence of mutations

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,008
and sit back, let it run and watch it try
to accomplish its goal -

34
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,908
a naturally selected impressive moving machine.

35
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,639
For more terror check out "tanos1998's"

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,599
and Dead Frontier Outbreak 2.
This text adventure test your wits.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,999
Would you be able to make the right
decisions during a zombie apocalypse to

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,159
protect yourself

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,409
and save your wife?
Then relax and feed the head,

40
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,019
a big blue head you can feed, pull on, click on.

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,299
What's the point?
Well, who knows?

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,519
And how could I forget YouTube.com/cosmicpanda.

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,689
It's not a channel.
Instead, it's a place where you can toggle

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,749
into YouTube experiments.
There are some cool things like, for instance,

45
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,568
if you're on the Vsauce channel page
you can watch our explosion video

46
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,919
and boom. All of our other videos
are right there underneath,

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,469
ready to play one after the other.
And if you decide to go back to our channel

48
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:45,988
page

49
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,359
the video keeps playing.
It's still right up there

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,059
in the corner. And that's just one of a
bunch of cool experiments going on in

51
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,609
Cosmic Panda.
Try it out.

52
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,479
Let me know what you think.
"legoluke2000" has Oddcast's

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,809
text-to-speech site.
Their eyes follow your cursor

54
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,149
and they'll say whatever you type, which is
a perfect way to tell you to subscribe

55
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,329
to Vsauce,

56
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,899
so you're always up to date.

57
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,979
And as always,

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,200
thanks for watching.
