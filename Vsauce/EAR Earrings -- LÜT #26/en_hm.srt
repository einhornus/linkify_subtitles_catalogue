1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:03,378
A bird house that looks like a
surveillance camera

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:08,038
and Mister Spock-topus.
It's episode 26

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,239
of LÃœT.
Now, here's a perfume designed to make you smell

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,448
like a book. And Generate offers a limited edition

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:21,339
life wall clock.
It's just like a normal clock,

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,459
except slowed down by a factor of 61,320.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,959
Every number represents a year

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,499
and it's meant to go around once in
the average person's life.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,509
Keep your head warm by making your own
knitted brain hat,

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,789
but if you prefer ears, put some ears

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,919
on your ears, or around your neck,

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,999
or on your finger, or how about a mouth?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,898
In fact, just get a nose ring.
No, no, no.

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:55,049
A nose ring.
Fifty Shades of Grey

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,619
Learn them. Seriously.
Here's a poster delineating

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,099
fifty shades of grey.
And these plates are perfect for

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,419
finger food, because they are finger sized.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,929
Now, if you're going to be making
sandwiches, use this crust cutter to turn

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,809
it into two

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,539
dolphins and a heart.
If it's too early for sandwiches,

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,849
simply be a cereal killer.
Tuxedo

22
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,659
ring, emoticon rings,  inflatable Cthulhu arm or

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,779
or this touching little number.
Two rings

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,699
that come attached at the middle.
You snap them apart, so that you and one

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,618
other person

26
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:37,599
have perfectly matching, unique two-of-a-kind rings.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,669
Time moves under

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,039
this watch's face, crossing the red present line.

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,408
Now, you can't see the future and the past is gone,

30
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,459
faded away.
For lunch, carry your sandwiches

31
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,798
in disguise bags. And rock in a rocking
chair designed to generate electricity

32
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,169
while you rock ... paper, scissors

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,539
necklaces are cool and sausage neck
pillows are even better.

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,388
When you fall asleep, don't do it alone, with these sheets

35
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,469
which have a fake little dog on them to
keep you company. The goofy eyes on this

36
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,079
clock tell you the time.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,119
The one on your left looks to be hour
and the other looks at the minute.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,509
This gumball tastes like apple cobbler,

39
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,829
but it's just the desert in your TV dinner gumset.

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,458
These two are flavored like roast beef
and buttered corn.

41
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,459
And these envelopes are fruit-flavoured,
when you lick them to stick them.

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,708
Oh look, a bathroom mist designed to smell

43
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,419
like a baby's head. Here's a special
thermally insulated bag that's great for

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,208
transporting

45
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,669
wine, but it looks like a cheap paper bag.

46
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,268
And you can frighten people
when you sip from your cracked

47
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,559
mug, full of death wish coffee.

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,559
A special roast guaranteed to be the strongest

49
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,818
coffee you've ever tasted.
Both in terms of flavor

50
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,929
and caffeine content.

51
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,979
Your iPhone can snap into this little
guy to become your pet

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,378
and these urine sample bottles contain a delicious

53
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,079
yellow liquid candy. Quiet down the
baby with a pacifiers that puts a

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,859
mustache

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,789
under his nose. This straw building kit
allows you to make your own custom

56
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,128
straws for mixing and sharing drinks

57
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:25,029
and these straws give you a kissy face.
Of course, make sure you're fancy

58
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,169
and use these fine disposable paper cups.

59
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,509
Or use an R2-D2 mug or glasses

60
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,079
designed to express each one of the seven

61
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,378
deadly sins.
For instance, pride,

62
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,559
sloth,

63
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,819
gluttony, wrath.

64
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,279
Here's a company that will take two
photos of your head and use them to print

65
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,549
a 3D action figure head of your face.

66
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,739
The smallest size can be used on LEGO dudes.

67
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,339
Or look, just use this backpack that
turns into a basketball

68
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,929
hoop.
Or this goopy mud that changes color with your mood

69
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,909
and why roll your sushi when you could
pack up this device

70
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,739
and a have a sushi bazooka?
Here's a fun free thing.

71
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,649
Desktop Gremlins offers easy to build
templates for fun paper

72
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,939
creations - video game characters, books, movies.

73
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,539
He even made a special YouTube Space Lab

74
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,829
papercraft, because on September 13th

75
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,539
the winning experiments will be done in outer space

76
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,309
live, right here on YouTube.
Ok, finally,

77
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,749
let's get beard-y.
A beard for your Apple,

78
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,699
lavender beard conditioner, beard love buttons

79
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,989
and last, but not least, a beer/beard

80
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,619
cozy. Amazing, right?
Well, for more cool things you can actually own

81
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,199
I highly suggest watching Naomi Kyle's show Cheap

82
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,769
Cool Crazy. It's on IGN's channel START,
which is full of original programming

83
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,029
for nerds like us.
Oh and, and,

84
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,669
as always,

85
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,270
thanks for watching.
