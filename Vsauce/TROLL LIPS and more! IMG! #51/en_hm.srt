1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,879
Violin skulls and the most popular social
networks by country.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,319
It's episode 51 of IMG!

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,699
Our Sun is big, like really, really big.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,799
Take a look at this photo of the transit of Venus.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,239
Brady Haran pointed this out to me.
Venus is pretty big.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,599
Almost the size of Earth, but the Sun in this
photo is huge and to put it in perspective,

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:38,019
in this photo the Sun is 67 million miles
further away from us.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,968
But more seriously, what colour is the Moon?
I mean, it's easy to think that the Moon is

9
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,968
just a bright, white silvery grey.
But a lot of that brightness is an illusion,

10
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,478
caused by the fact that the Moon is brighter
than everything around it.

11
00:00:53,479 --> 00:01:01,259
In fact, the Moon only reflects 12% of the
light that hits it from the Sun, which means

12
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,119
the Moon is quite dim.
In fact, it's about the same colour as asphalt,

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,849
which means that if you were to put the Moon
and Earth in equal illumination, the Moon

14
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,219
would look like this.
And if you follow @tweetsauce, last week you

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,939
would have seen how shallow the oceans are
compared to the radius of the Earth.

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,959
If you were to take all the water on Earth
and collect it into a single ball, it would

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,379
only be this large.
Mountains and valleys on Earth's surface are

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,489
even more puny compared to its overall size.
If you were to take the Earth and shrink it

19
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,789
down to the proportions of a pool ball, the
Earth would be smoother than an actual pool

20
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,169
ball.
But I guess what really matters is that you

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,709
should be careful kissing these lips.
And in case of trouble, call on these superhero

22
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,889
lips to save the day.
Nicholas Night's "Social network" series makes

23
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,879
Facebook a bit more real.
This one is called "Joining a group."

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,619
"Reached a new high score in Mafia Wars."

25
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,199
"Only some friends see you."

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,388
And "Being a fan of."
Now, a few days ago on Reddit, this giant

27
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:20,059
collection of Facebook timeline covers showed up.

28
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,798
You've got Tetris, fencing, funny walks,
states of matter and more.

29
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:31,339
Reddit also showed me that with the right
positions and camera angle, you can hide not

30
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,979
one, but two extra people.
Moving on.

31
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,619
On a secluded Mexican island a local man
has been decorating trees with people.

32
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,188
Baby people.
But in Morocco the trees are just full of

33
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:49,328
climbing goats.
Oh and these woods?

34
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:55,218
There's a hidden face.
See if you can find the face, but be careful.

35
00:02:55,219 --> 00:03:00,068
Post-It notes can be decoration,
like building-sized decorations.

36
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:07,259
Or just hang yourself off a building by lying
on top of it and looking up at your reflection.

37
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,539
Robert The carves old books into elaborate shapes.

38
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,939
And this artist stacks and crams book pages,
magazines and newspapers into amazing designs,

39
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,839
including people.
Here's a barn that's actually a converted

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,919
water tower.
And if you're afraid your beard might fall

41
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,068
off, you better grow a beard strap.
If you're wondering why all of these animals

42
00:03:32,069 --> 00:04:04,179
are so satisfied, the answer is simple.
Animals are using  the Internet.

43
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,719
Not a fan of animals?
Well, suit yourself.

44
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,519
Expect along with the reflection that looks
like it says something else.

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,139
And sculptures love escaping.
In Japan, KitKats are much more diverse.

46
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:24,539
They've got flavours like pumpkin, potato,
sweet corn, even watermelon and salt.

47
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,119
Mashable shared a diverse collection of geeky cufflinks.

48
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,999
QR codes, typewriter keys, floppy disks and likes.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,009
Now for something less diverse, look at your zipper.

50
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:45,699
Chances are it says "YKK."
90% of zippers in the world are made by the

51
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,139
YKK group.
Keep being saucy.

52
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,509
And as always,

53
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,060
thanks for watching.
