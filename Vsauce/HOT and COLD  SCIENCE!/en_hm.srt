00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,068
Vsauce, Michael here to tell you that episode

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:09,039
3 of Leanback is ready. This week the
topic is temperature from very high

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,258
to very low.
It's a television show length

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,939
playlist that I host containing videos from
people all over YouTube.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,819
Now, this one's kind of science-y this time, but I think
the videos that make it up are pretty

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,049
awesome no matter what.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,099
Now, because I can't send a playlist out to you the way
I can upload a video,

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,059
you're going to have to click the first,
top most link in this video's description to

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,108
get things rolling.
If you're on a phone,

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,169
playlists might not work and if you can't wait
for a better time to lean back,

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,779
I've put links to every video in the playlist
down below.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,898
And if you have a site and you wanna embed this entire experience,

13
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,839
guess what? The description has the code you need.
So what are you waiting for?

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,929
To get it started and let the videos play
themselves and the Internet do the work,

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,669
get some knowledge, click the link...

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,839
And as always,

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,960
thanks for watching.
