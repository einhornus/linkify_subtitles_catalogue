Hey, Vsauce. Michael here...
Coming to you from the Barbican in London.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,779
It's beautiful, it's like living inside the
Regenstein Library.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,919
That's a concrete joke.
But, I've put together a leanback of videos

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,099
all around YouTube that I really like,
that I host as a playlist.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,939
You can start it by clicking the link at the
top of this video's description.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,099
It's best if you're on a computer or a laptop,
something like that.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,119
But to make it worth your time in this video,
I'm going to share some facts I learned this

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,159
week that were quite surprising and cool.
For instance, being attractive might actually

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,699
mean that you are better, if you play American football.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,879
When females were asked to rank the hotness
of male American football players, there was

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,708
a quite surprising correlation.
The players that the females ranked as being

12
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:55,138
hotter also tended to be the players with
the highest passing ratings.

13
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:58,499
Passing.
Not like passing in a car with a... with a

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,698
football.
But passing in a car brings up the question

15
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:06,798
of gas prices.
When gas prices go up, fewer people drive

16
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,299
and when fewer people are driving,
 there are fewer accidents.

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,699
It's actually quite mathematical.
It has been shown that for every 10% increase

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:23,239
in the cost of gas,
the number of car accidents goes down by 2.3%.

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,379
Fewer accidents means fewer deaths.
And here's a fact about death.

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:35,099
More people have died inside the Halo games
than have ever died in real life on Earth,

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,779
throughout the entire history of humans being around.

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,239
Killing somebody in real life makes you a murderer.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,949
But the definitions of terms like that are very specific.

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:58,078
For instance, if you kill four or more people
at one time, you're technically considered

25
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,538
by the FBI a mass murderer.
And if you kill two or more people, sometimes

26
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:09,317
three or more people, with a time gap in between
those events - a cooling down period, you

27
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:16,439
are technically a serial killer. Based on the number of unsolved murders, criminologists

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,639
estimate that in the United States, at any
given time, there are about 100 serial killers

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,279
who have yet to be caught walking amongst us.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,159
So, keep your eyes peeled or blink if you want to.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:38,699
I mean, the average person blinks 15 times a minute.
But when you watch television or YouTube videos,

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,628
you blink even less frequently - only about
7.5 times a minute.

33
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,509
So why blink more often than you have to?
Go ahead and click the link at the top of

34
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,878
the description to play the Vsauce Leanback.
It's sure to keep your eyes open, because

35
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,399
it's full of videos around the topic of surprise.
I'll see you over there, be sure to subscribe

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,579
to Vsauce for more videos...

37
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,669
And as always,

38
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,390
thanks for watching.
