It all begins
with Sigmund Freud.

 Edward Bernays.

number of people quickly.

34
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,709
Bernays took advantage

not with the intention
to inform,

but with the intention
to control.

37
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,452
 In the 1920s,
 Ed Bernays asked a doctor

38
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:04,589
 who worked at his agency
 whether a breakfast should be

39
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,959
 heavy or light, and the doctor
 pretty much said,

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,928
 "I guess heavy
 would be better."

41
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,330
