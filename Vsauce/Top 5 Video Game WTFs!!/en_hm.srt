00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,439
Today we are going to be looking at some of
the Top 5 Video Game WTF's.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,109
There are way more than 5 out there, but,
guess what, 5 is a nice round number, and,

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,609
it's the number of girlfriends I have.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,238
And by 5, I mean 0.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,019
Definitions: I'm not including things that
are obvious and intended.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,519
And I'm not including things that are fan-made,
but I really wish I could.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,819
And I'm also not including things that are
part of winning the game.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,869
Number 5 is a CoDMW2WTF, and, yeah, it's a
blow up.

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,119
But not that kind...this kind.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,319
In Assassin's Creed, MPC's have been found
glitched out, humping the walls at amazing

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,319
speeds.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,599
I would be a lot more weirded out if I wasn't
so impressed with their speed.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,599
Look at that.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,599
I want that.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,029
World of Warcraft is filled with WTF's.

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,569
We could make an entire countdown just about
them, but let me show you my favorite.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:00,189
In Dalaran there's a Blood Elf who continuously
strokes a red-hot metal rod.

18
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,929
Let's just take a moment of silence.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,019
If you jump on your Rhino and your barrel
at the same time, you ride the Rhino.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,538
Ride.

21
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,538
Number 1:

22
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,188
I love this because of its subtlety.

23
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,519
It's in Bioshock.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,938
After what appears to be a big explosion,
take a look...yeah...that is why this is number

25
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:25,938
1.

26
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:26,938
So, there you go.

27
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,699
To me, those are some of the Top 5 WTF's in
video gaming, but there are so many more.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,629
If you had already seen every clip I talked
about today, give this video a thumbs up to

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,328
let everyone know that you are a genius, and
if you've seen others that aren't on this

30
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,068
list, please put it in the comments.

31
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,438
I want to see more of these things, they're
are awesome.

32
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,879
Once you've done that, be sure to subscribe,
and stay Saucy my friends.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,668
(In whisper) Psst, hey, hey are you still
there?

34
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:56,819
Ok, awesome, listen to me.

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,178
There's this really cool thing I found- it's
called Facebook.

36
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:03,648
I don't know, it's kind of weird, I don't
really get it.

37
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,598
But, we're there, check it out.

38
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,959
There's a link in the description.

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,060
Ok, ok, bye.
