1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,878
Hey, Vsauce.

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:07,148
Michael here.
And the year 6009

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,689
will be the very first year since 1961 that a year

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,259
when written in Hindu-Arabic numerals 
can be inverted

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,749
and still look the same.
But you and I

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,368
probably won't live long enough to enjoy
the year six thousand

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,589
and nine.
Human lives just aren't long enough.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,118
We will miss out on that.
What other cool future offense will we be

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,379
missing?
Well, first of all,

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,669
you and I will probably be gone before
the completion of the time

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,639
pyramid in Wemding, Germany.
It will eventually be a pile of

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,709
120 concrete blocks.
But the builders

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,729
are only adding one block every 10 years.

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,738
Since beginning in 1993 they've added

15
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,389
only the first three.
At this rate the pyramid will be completed in the year

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,949
3183.

17
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,529
The final block placed by

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,199
our great great great great great great,
more than 30 greats

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,609
grandchildren.
But even they will miss

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,529
an opportunity to frolic and play safely
in the Chernobyl

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,679
Exclusion Zone.
The zone of

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,908
alienation, where radioactive
contamination from the 1986 disaster

23
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,548
will remain at levels too high

24
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,438
for safe human activity until not the year 4000,

25
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,908
not the 5000, not the 6000.
It will finally be safe

26
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,888
probably in the year 22 000.

27
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:46,889
Possibly within our lifetimes
but definitely within the next one

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,059
million years,

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,319
stars like Betelgeuse and Eta Carinae

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,719
will explode in brilliant supernovas

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,258
visible from earth. I'm bummed I'm
probably going to miss out on these

32
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,349
events because

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,519
for a few weeks it will look almost as if earth

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,079
has two Suns. Despite being hundreds,
thousands of light-years away,

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,238
their supernovas will shine brighter
than the full Moon

36
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,479
at night and be visible even during daytime.

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,669
But the real sky show comes in 3.75

38
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,639
billion years.
Our galaxy

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,128
is full of stars, viewed from the surface of the earth

40
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,889
they look like little drops of milk in the sky,

41
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,639
which is why we call it the Milky Way Galaxy.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,119
But all galaxies are named after

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,419
milk. Milk, lactose,

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,048
lactic, ga-lactic, galaxies.

45
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,188
And every drop of milk in the sky,
every star that you can see,

46
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,438
is inside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

47
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,938
But there's a blurry distant

48
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,568
shape. This one.
It's not a star, it's not a cloud of gas

49
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,348
in our galaxy, it is an entirely different

50
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,858
Galaxy - the Andromeda Galaxy and it's two-and-a-half

51
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:15,419
million light years away from our own.
It contains twice as many stars as the

52
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,378
Milky Way

53
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,229
and it is coming our way.
Headed toward us

54
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,729
at 300 kilometres a second, faster than a

55
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,869
bullet.
Right now, the sky looks like this.

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,688
In 2 billion years Andromeda
will have approached so closely

57
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:34,869
that people will look up at the sky and see

58
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,408
this.
In 3.75 billion years the night sky will be like

59
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,658
a scene from a science fiction movie or
an awesome desktop wallpaper.

60
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,518
Incredible and kind of scary.

61
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,059
After this scene, the sky will literally
be glowing with the birth of new stars

62
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,078
as the Milky Way and Andromeda collide,
mixing up into a brilliant cosmic

63
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,689
tie-dye. This simulation shows how
Andromeda might collide with the Milky

64
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,149
Way,

65
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,189
but keep in mind that you are watching billions

66
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,918
of years pass every second.
These galaxies

67
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,168
are moving fast but they're also huge

68
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,759
and covering even huger distances.
They

69
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,828
will collide in the future but within the briefness

70
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,829
of a single human life they appear almost frozen,

71
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,179
unmoving.
A couple billion years after colliding

72
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,959
the course of both galaxies will be
married together

73
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,198
in a bright glowing centre.
Earth, now

74
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,508
a stepchild to what was once Andromeda,

75
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,589
part of a new, bigger family called

76
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,538
Milkdromeda. It would be so cool to be
alive to see our galaxy

77
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,259
colliding with another.
But don't get all fomo,

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,379
consumed by a fear of missing

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,038
out. Because whatever life is around then
will have plenty to envy us for.

80
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,609
They may have spectacular nightly views,
but secretly wish they'd been born in

81
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,359
our time

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,819
to experience, say, the beginning of the Internet.

83
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,929
They will actually miss out on a lot of things.

84
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,629
Because the Moon moves one centimetre
further away from

85
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,489
earth every year, 
600 million years from today

86
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,839
the Moon will no longer be close enough
to earth to completely

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,849
block out the Sun.

88
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,189
Future humans or descendants of humans
will therefore

89
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,168
miss out on a chance to ever see for themselves

90
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:40,379
the beauty of the total solar eclipse
from the surface of Earth.

91
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,449
Long before earth dries up

92
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,499
Niagara Falls will dry up.
Well,

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,059
not the water part, but the falls part.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,619
Every year the rushing water of Niagara
erodes the rock at the top of the

95
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,429
falls

96
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,888
one foot backward.
By the year 52 000

97
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,569
it will have eroded all the way to
Lake Erie and our progeny will have no

98
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,978
Niagara Falls

99
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,199
to enjoy.
Granite has an erosion rate of about

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,439
one inch per ten thousand years.

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,189
So, certainly by the year 7 million

102
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,379
Mount Rushmore, especially its faces, will no longer

103
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,418
exist.
And because they slowly get

104
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,579
pulled in or rejected into space,
in 50 to 100 million years

105
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,409
Saturn will no longer have its lovely rings.

106
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,779
So, life on earth in the future

107
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,049
might have awesome supernovas and
galactic collisions to look forward to

108
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,599
but they probably won't have Niagara Falls,

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,699
Mount Rushmore, total solar eclipses or Saturn's rings.

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,309
They also won't have you.
But

111
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,699
you have you. Except not all of it.

112
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,499
Babies don't begin to form episodic
memories right

113
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,929
away, meaning that you missed out on. 
You don't remember two of the most seminal

114
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,489
events in your life.

115
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,689
Your conception and your birth.

116
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,099
But you can experience a bit of those moments

117
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,879
right now.
First of all,

118
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,388
When Was I Conceived? dot com
lets you enter your birthday

119
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,989
and get back the week your parents probably made

120
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,189
you happen, as well as the number one
song and the number one movie of that

121
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,629
week, which may have also been involved.

122
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,429
Light travels quickly, the most quickest

123
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,538
in fact.
But it can take a photon millions

124
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:45,339
of years to escape from the interior of the star
it was created in through nuclear fusion.

125
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,319
It takes time, just like your own gestation

126
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,788
in your mother's womb.
Newly conceived photons

127
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:56,219
struggle through a dense stellar jungle

128
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,478
of atoms and molecules and electrons that
absorb and reemit the photon, taking a

129
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,899
little bit of energy from it as a randomly

130
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,848
rolls around like a pinball.
Sometimes after thousands or millions of

131
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:11,598
years it's random walk finally leads it to the stars'

132
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,269
surface, where it pops out into space.

133
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,869
In a way, is born. A lucky, tiny tiny tiny
percentage of the photons that reach the

134
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,158
surface of a star

135
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,799
find themselves on a path that will intersect

136
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,228
with earth.
And if you are lucky, those photons will

137
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,298
end their journey by being absorbed

138
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,178
under your own retina.
If you enter the date of your birth or the

139
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,168
approximate date of your conception into
this online calculator

140
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,889
you can find a star that is as many
light years away from

141
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,669
earth as you are old.
When you look up at that start today,

142
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,869
you are seeing light that left the star the very month

143
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,458
you were born or photons that left that star

144
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,469
and entered space when
your entire body was just

145
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,099
one cell.

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,049
Space is really big and your life is very short

147
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,159
but space is so gosh darn big you don't
have to miss out

148
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,079
on everything.

149
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,299
And as always,

150
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,680
thanks for watching.
