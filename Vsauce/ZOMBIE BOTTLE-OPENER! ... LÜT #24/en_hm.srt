1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,408
Suck on a fish head lollipop

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:07,829
and chew bubble gum shaped like butt cheeks.
It's episode 24

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,008
of LÜT.

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,909
Vat19's chameleon lamp detects
the color of the surface

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,099
it's on and glows that color.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,099
You can also turn your iPhone into a
laser pointer with an app

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,389
and a smart dot that plugs right into
the headphone jack.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,268
But what has even more energy than a laser?
That's right,

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,119
Vsauce t-shirts.
The official team jerseys

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,799
of Wesaucers everywhere, for boys and girls.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,078
We just launched this store.
If you get one and where it to VidCon,

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,499
reward yourself with cookies cut into
Pacman shapes

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,519
or just march the shapes down Abbey Road.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,198
Busted Tees has more apparel designs.
You can twist nerdy

15
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,639
brains with "Similes are like metaphors,"

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,189
or my favorite, Helvetiva written in Comic

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,419
Sans.
Or the first true

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,199
digital cowboy.
Busted Tees also offers

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,969
bookends? Well, this one makes it look like
your books are about to squish a guy.

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,999
Knob Creek Metal Arts makes even more.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,728
Chainsaws, giraffes, mermaids,

22
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,959
abductions and more.
Butt

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,539
magnets, animal butt magnets.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,618
Are you trying to carry stuff more often?

25
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,749
Well, TheCheeky brings you glasses you can't set

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,728
down. They have no flat bottom,
so they'll spill if you try to put them down.

27
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,118
Now, this amazingly intricate chocolate
temple is even more

28
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,618
intricately wrapped in silver foil.
But here's an even better idea.

29
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,749
Make hard things soft.
These pillows

30
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,859
photo realistically reproduce
textures like plywood and concrete, but if

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,798
you prefer

32
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,019
be musical with boombox pillows

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,399
and keep it cute with glasses that give you anime eyes.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,629
Of course, these glasses make it look
like someone's got their

35
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,828
hands over your eyes, but I prefer to shade

36
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,059
my sight with a country.
The USA.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,199
Now, you don't really need glasses when it's rainy,

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,579
but how will you write on paper?
Easy, with write in the rain - special

39
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,809
waterproof paper

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,988
that a pencil will always write on,
especially if you sharpen it inside the nostril

41
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,238
of a nose pencil sharpener.
When the Sun comes back out,

42
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,068
this iPad case will charge the iPad in
it using solar power.

43
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,128
But even without the Sun,
sprout bookmarks make it look like

44
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,399
life and leaves are springing from your novels.
Novels you store on

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,149
invisible shelves.
The special peace holds 15 pounds of book,

46
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,378
but hides inside the bottom book,
so they appear to float

47
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:52,169
in the air. Now, back to leaves.
If you get leaves like spinach and other junk stuck in

48
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,309
your teeth after eating,

49
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,589
fear no more with a mirror in a plate.

50
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,208
Once you're done eating you reveal
a mirror to check your teeth.

51
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,229
You can look beyond your own face and into space

52
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,559
with ThinkGeek's space-y serving bowls - the Moon,

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,889
the Sun and Earth.
For the kids or yourself,

54
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,329
I like this landscape dinner set.
A Sun cup,

55
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,539
a house plate, evergreen utensils and a cloud bowl.

56
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,949
Now, if the food on the plate is bland,

57
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,169
season it with salt and pepper from
shakers shaped like

58
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,598
Fred and Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby,
Kermit and Miss Piggy

59
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,999
or fozzie bear and a banana peel.
You can precisely

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,899
warm your now seasoned dishes in the
oven with this magnetic

61
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,408
timer that makes your fridge look like a safe.

62
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,889
Or just use a watch that is a giant

63
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,219
10-key number pad. ThinkGeek also offers
a chocolate-scented t-shirt featuring

64
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,348
a chocolate molecule from Theobroma cacao.

65
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,408
Even sweeter is upgrading your unsightly mudflap girls

66
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:00,179
with these smart mudflaps girls.

67
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,238
Now jam to some tunes played out of your Marshall

68
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,628
amp.
Just kidding, it's a mini fridge full of

69
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,959
beers you can open with the jaws of a brain-hungry

70
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,169
zombie. If zombies scare you,
try using a night light shaped like a creature

71
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,338
trying to

72
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,439
unplug itself.
Or, light your way with this

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,399
USB powered lamp that looks like a cup
of melty chocolate

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,399
pouring all over.
But if you need more USB ports,

75
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,829
Fred Flare offers this cute little poodle USB

76
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,289
hub.
You can turn any photo into a hip retro

77
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,589
polaroid with these polar frames.
And stop flicking your wrist

78
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,609
to tell the time with this watch.
It's tilted 55 degrees,

79
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,638
so it lines up with the natural way you
hold your arms

80
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,989
in front of you.
Now, earlier this week I was in Munich

81
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,549
at Frühlingsfest where I successfully saw
historical things,

82
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,769
ferris wheel things, ate a half meter long sausage

83
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,149
and met Bernd das Brot.
I got water on my glasses, because it hailed.

84
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,459
I did get a giant pretzel...
And as always,

85
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,760
thanks for watching.
