1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:03,509
Vsauce. Michael here today with a
special video.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,179
It's a Skype conversation I had with Newt
from Underbelly where he teaches me

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,529
about six actual villains from real
comic books

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,419
that are really, really lame. He's joined
by a bunch of ladies from Underbelly,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,899
and as you will see immediately from
Storytime, he's quite

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,688
the ladies man.
First things first, you should know that

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,999
I'm kinda busy right now playing the
May update for Angry Birds Rio

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,919
and I'm not wearing pants.
So,

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,029
we're already up to a really good start.
"Hey, over here.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,939
It can't be," Prince Hobopopo says.
"In the flesh."

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,009
If you're gonna read me the bad guys, you
gotta read in the scary voice. You know I

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,589
only want you on the show if you do what
I tell you. "In the flesh."

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,919
Just be quiet, I wanna do this.
At number 6

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,509
we were gonna have Kite-Man, who's a Batman
villain, who's just some

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,359
dork with a kite strapped to his back,
but I decided instead

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,229
to go with a color-blind villain, because
color blindness is nothing to joke about

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,089
in America.

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,649
So, I thought I would go with Rainbow
Rider, who is a flash

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,728
villain and this guy just sucks, alright?
He basically

20
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:15,228
has glasses that project colours and
then he create structures for him to

21
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,029
emote from that are colourful, but I mean,
really, this guy's just fabulous. 'Cause

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,459
everything

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,758
is rainbow colored. Anyway, it's just one of those
characters where it's like four o'clock in

24
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,529
the morning and they're like "oh, we got to
have the Flash fight, somebody."

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,589
"I know, we'll have a guy who rides rainbows."
The

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,188
next one on the list, number 5,
we have armless

27
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,529
Tiger Man. Basically this guy's story was
he was a small German boy who had his

28
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,578
arms ripped off

29
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,258
in an industrial accident. He went around
during Golden Age Marvel books

30
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,749
using his sharp teeth and his prowess with his toes

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,679
to destroy all machines.
Next up on the list we have Crazy

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,519
Quilt, who is a Batman villain and this
guy has the most

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,868
eye-be-jarringly bad costume in comic book history.

34
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,319
And I think I just made up the word "eye-be-jarring." Crazy Quilt was a low-level

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,669
robber who was blinded by a bullet,

36
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,659
but in prison had an experimental
surgery to restore his vision,

37
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,059
but unfortunately the vision that he was
left with was so disorienting

38
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,289
that it drove him crazy. Wow, Vsauce doesn't even have t-shirts and you guys already have

39
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,329
dresses and girls.
We have several... we have home and away uniforms.

40
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,719
Next up on the list we have Egg Fu.

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,219
An Egg Fu was a Wonder Woman villain,
who, at the peak of the Red Scare,

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,649
would try to have people denounce their
love for the red white and blue

43
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,579
and this worked with him using fear,
because he is essentially a giant

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,529
egg with a mustache.
Katie, what do you think about Egg Fu?

45
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,579
It doesn't matter, she's a woman.
Next up from the

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,749
freaky deaky seventies,
we have the Hypno-Hustler.

47
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,979
And this guy's clearly... he's got the most glorious

48
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,869
glittering crusted Afro I've seen
on the printed page, it's amazing.

49
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,519
Armed with hypno goggles and...
Oh, one second. Thank you.

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,549
Any port in a storm, right?

51
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,629
The ladies keep coming. I have them bring
me drinks every now and again when

52
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,269
I get parched.

53
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,569
Armed with his hypno goggles

54
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,589
and power boots, he put the audience in a trance

55
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,379
and was able to rob them.
His name is

56
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,419
Turner D. Century and he was a Spider Woman

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,399
villain and essentially he, he hates
young people

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,059
and he wants to restore, restore
San Francisco to the glory days

59
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,059
of like the 1900's.
So he flies around

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,449
on a bicycle, okay?
And he goes

61
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,969
toe-to-dandy-toe with any superhero
who tries to stop him.

62
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,779
And he has a horn that's honking fury
will kill anyone under the age of 65

63
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,369
years old.

64
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,859
And that's how he can restore San
Francisco to the glory days.

65
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,209
So that was our top six worst,
my top six super villains

66
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,439
in comic book history. And this is
kicking off, this month is Superhero Month.

67
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,999
We're gonna give you a top 10 worst
superhero list,

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,869
so turn up a little bit. Kevin

piece called "Saving Superman."
And then we're gonna introduce a new

71
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,129
