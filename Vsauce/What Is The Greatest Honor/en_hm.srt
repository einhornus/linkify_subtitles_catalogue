1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,428
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But where

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:06,659
is here and how much does it weigh?

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,018
That's the supposed to be me, huh?
Imitation is a form of flattery.

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,659
An honor.
But what is the greatest honor

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,868
possible?

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,868
Let's begin our journey by looking at
challenges and achievements

7
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,609
worthy of honour.
First, the physical ones.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,639
Being the fastest person to run a marathon

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,839
26.2 miles is great but why stop there?

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,099
The Iron Man triathlon involves

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,849
swimming - 2.4 miles, racing on a bicycle 112 miles

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,279
and then running an entire marathon.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,529
Record holder Craig Alexander did it all in

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,149
8 hours, 3 minutes and 56 seconds.

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,959
Beyond that things begin to get mental.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,878
The self transcendence race held every
summer in New York

17
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,048
is the longest certified foot race

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,349
on the planet.
It's not 26 miles long,

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,839
it's 3100.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,279
And instead of running thousands of miles
across the varied

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,579
landscape of the US, competitors merely run

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,139
around the same city block in Queens

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,809
5 649 times.

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,739
You have 52 days to complete the
race and doing so can

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,699
wear out as many as 12 pairs of shoes.

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,439
The fastest time for completing the race
goes to Wolfgang Schwerk

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,938
who finished in just 41 days,

28
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,078
averaging 75 miles of running

29
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,589
every day.
In the realm of entertainment

30
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,419
there are very clear physical rewards, statuettes like

31
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,478
the Emmy, the Grammy, the Oscar and the Tony.

32
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,788
Winning at least one of each is called an

33
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:01,798
EGOT. So far 11 humans have won all
four awards in competitive categories.

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,388
Marvin Hamlisch and Richard Rodgers
also each won a Pulitzer Prize.

35
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:11,129
Lynn Redgrave is the only person to have
ever been nominated

36
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,129
for all four awards without winning

37
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:20,009
a single one.
Some people have won surprising combinations of awards.

38
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,829
Steve Tisch, as chairman and executive
vice president of the New York Giants

39
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,089
and producer of films like Forrest Gump,
American History X

40
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,259
and Snatch is the only person in history
to have won both

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,599
a Super Bowl ring and an Oscar.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,189
And throughout all of human history only one person

43
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,249
has won an Oscar and a Nobel Prize.

44
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,959
George Bernard Shaw.
Those are neat facts

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,819
but let's define honour. There are two
guys we should go to. The first is Noah

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,489
Webster

47
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,669
whose American Dictionary is the reason Americans

48
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,179
spell it honor. The second guy is Samuel
Johnson whose English Dictionary is the

49
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,009
reason people

50
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,279
across the Atlantic, where I usually am, spell it

51
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,849
honour. Johnson differentiated two types
of honored that are relevant to the

52
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,539
question

53
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,249
in this video's title.
The first is what he calls

54
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,239
nobility of soul, magnanimity and the scorn

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,299
of meanness. This is honour derived not from
achievement at something competitive

56
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,289
but rather from perceived virtuous conduct

57
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,049
and personal integrity.
But what counts

58
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,829
as a virtue? One of my favorite attempts
to catalog human virtues was done by

59
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,089
Christopher Peterson

60
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,599
and Martin Seligman.
Frustrated by a persistent

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,139
focus on mental illness, they devised a guide

62
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,759
to mental wellness.
Their catalog contains 24

63
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,099
virtues and strengths shared across nearly every

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,439
human culture.
They attached historical figures

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,659
believed to personify each trait and
their list of 24

66
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,969
included fairness, humility,

67
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,599
hope, humor, appreciation,

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,949
of beauty and the love of learning.
Using

69
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,528
their list as a scorecard for virtue points to determine

70
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,388
the most honorable person is impossible

71
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,999
but that hasn't stopped people from
discussing the greatest

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,839
honor in terms of virtue.
Richard Nixon did some things that people might

73
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,529
consider

74
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,049
dishonorable, but his perspective is illuminating.

75
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,248
In his first inaugural address he said "the greatest

76
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:40,079
honor history can bestow is the title

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,059
of peacemaker."
Peacemaker.

78
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,628
But who has the authority to judge virtue?

79
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,239
Hopefully not individuals.
Richard Wiseman's brilliant

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,408
"Quirkology" discusses a survey conducted
in 1997 by US News & World Report,

81
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,668
which asked people who they thought was

82
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,978
somewhat likely to go to heaven

83
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,508
as a marker of perceived virtuous
conduct and personal integrity

84
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,739
it's really illuminating.
52 percent

85
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,149
thought that Bill Clinton would,
60 percent but Princess Diana would

86
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,589
and a full 79 percent said
that they thought Mother Teresa

87
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,198
would go to heaven but she was only second-place.

88
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,829
87 percent of respondents agreed that someone else

89
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,188
was likely to go to heaven.
Who do they think that was?

90
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:39,459
Themselves.
The greatest honor a country bestows upon those

91
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,109
who have defended, fought for it, often carries the most

92
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,318
awe-inspiring stories.
The greatest military honor in the United Kingdom

93
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,519
is the Victoria Cross.
In the United States

94
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,609
it's the Medal of Honor, given for
conspicuous gallantry

95
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,508
and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond

96
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,878
the call of duty.
Many of its recipients are honored

97
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,748
posthumously.
They are people who acted instantly

98
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:09,918
and without regard for their own safety

99
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,059
they've walked into enemy fire, loosing their lives

100
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,528
to communicate life-saving messages.
They have fallen on grenades

101
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,658
to absorb the impact with their bodies,

102
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:24,528
so that others around them wouldn't have to.

103
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,579
Samuel Johnson's second definition of honor

104
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,089
focuses not so much on honor that comes from being

105
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,188
ethically excellent, but instead on honor that comes

106
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,359
from power, from being royal

107
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,658
or famous. Global surveys have shown
that many corporate logos,

108
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,609
like the golden arches, are more famous
than any celebrity

109
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,269
or other symbols.
So, technically speaking, the greatest

110
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,829
honor as far as becoming famous and globally known

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,968
might simply be to become a fast food mascot.

112
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:02,878
Not all honorable people get honored.

113
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,989
How does a grand, recognized public act

114
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,658
made possible by being in the right
place at the right time with the right

115
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:13,808
opportunities compare to the honor of merely being

116
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:17,948
the best person you can be?
A good citizen,

117
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,568
a mother, a father, an otherwise

118
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,929
unrecognized person who is nonetheless

119
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,709
an amazing hero to a few.

120
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,128
Your family, your friends, that one person

121
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,938
who really needed you.
Is recognition merely

122
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,058
an accident of luck?
A snowball effect,

123
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:43,899
an accumulation of advantage.
People who stand out when they are young

124
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,408
are often given access to more opportunities,

125
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:51,728
which then leads to and entitles them
to more opportunities later on,

126
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,079
accumulating overtime like snow on a
snowball that eventually becomes an

127
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,128
entire boulder of snow

128
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:03,128
only the original snowball of which
was the original person.

129
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:07,528
Historians have pointed this phenomenon
out, the accumulation of advantage,

130
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,938
when criticizing the great man theory

131
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,459
of history.
The idea that human history can be talked

132
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,008
or understood as a time line of few

133
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,158
important honored individuals.

134
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,329
Philip Zimbardo, the researcher behind the infamous

135
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,179
Stanford Prison, study has shown that the
wrong situation can bring out

136
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,098
evil in almost anybody.
He stressed in his recent TED talk

137
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,019
that not all of us will encounter just
the right opportunities to become the

138
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,489
next

139
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,298
Gandhi or Neil Armstrong.
But what we can do

140
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,429
is live our lives with what Zimbardo calls

141
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,899
a heroic imagination.
As a hero and waiting,

142
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,799
who thinks sociocentrically, not egocentrically.

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,909
He says most heroes are everyday people,

144
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,309
who emerge as heroes in particular situations.

145
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,049
So, a fair argument can be made that simply

146
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,969
knowing you did the right thing when
presented with the situation involving

147
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,778
Peterson

148
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,958
and Seligman's virtues and strengths

149
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,109
is the greatest honour

150
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,898
possible, the most honorable life.

151
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,689
Now, whether or not that honorable
behavior is recognized

152
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,499
Well, Cato the Elder questioned the value imparted by

153
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,319
physical awards by simply saying, "after I'm dead

154
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,489
I'd rather have people ask why I have no monument

155
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,768
than why I have one."
It's an honor to talk to you guys

156
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:45,279
every week.
So, as always,

157
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,780
thanks for watching.
