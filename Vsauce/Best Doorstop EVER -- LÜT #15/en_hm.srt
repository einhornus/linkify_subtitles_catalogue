1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:04,258
A tentacle dress and cheeseburgers flip flops.
It's episode 15

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,299
of LÜT.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,518
Keep your doors open with NeatoShop's
gross gutsy zombie

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,058
doorstop.
Or be a superhero with these hoodies.

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,259
Look how serious he is.
Keep your dog warm with this scarf.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,599
I mean, let's talk about the Millennium
Falcon. Or a Star Wars flight jacket from

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,379
adidas.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,399
Studio Swine makes these glasses.
They're just

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,879
artwork for now, but are made out of
human hair. A strange, but renewable

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,808
resource.

11
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,359
These sticking peel stickers let you give
your electrical sockets fun

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,539
faces and Arlyn emailed me this Rubik's Cube

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,628
for the blind. You can also pick up a
stack of Rubik's Cube colored sticky

14
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:44,429
notes or

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,788
these notes that are reminders and Tetris.

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,299
ShanaLogic provides awesome things.
Currently

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,459
they're sold out of these earrings,
but have plenty of kitty tied to a balloon

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,718
necklaces. But if you wanna know the
animal on your necklace,

19
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,889
Uncommon Goods will send you a mould to
stick on your pet and send back.

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,139
Then they'll make you a custom necklace
in the shape

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,999
of your dog's nose.
Japan Trend Shop carries these samurai

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,769
underpants authentically designed after
the style of famous historical

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,649
warriors. And Peter Bristol makes this
informative dresser

24
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,599
that removes all confusion, while Miriam
Liebana has designed sperm shaped

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,449
cutlery

26
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,548
that brings meals to life.
Speaking of manly,

27
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,529
floss your power with this tactical
grilling apron and a handmade ring

28
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,889
scale replica

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,319
of a .44 caliber chamber.
For 10 bucks you could split your music with his

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,319
branch between your friend and your other friend.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,158
And for 80 bucks you can deconstruct the
lamp into its constituent

32
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,919
pieces. The cord itself wraps around
to produce

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,319
the lamp shade. Keep acting smart with a
working feather pen and quill set,

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,868
then go against the flow and watch a 3D movie

35
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:00,239
in 2D.
These glasses from ThinkGeek

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,398
isolate one layer of a 3D movie and give you a nice

37
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,769
flat picture. Your free thing this week
comes from "guardianjuan" who recommends

38
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,978
HardlyWork.in,

39
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,109
a site that can adapt your
Facebook into what looks like a

40
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,059
spreadsheet.

41
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,659
Now you can waste time at work
and look like the hardest-working

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,488
employee. Perfect.
Back in Kansas I found some great

43
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,929
confusing fireworks. The poopy puppy
actually makes a flaming

44
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,669
bowel movement and this depressed
middle-aged man? Well, he's part of the

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,829
500 grams of

46
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,799
black powder baby boomer explosive.
Almost as cool

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,299
is Blonde Joke, an explosive covered in

48
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,549
blonde women. Yeah, I don't know either.
But what I do know

49
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,269
is that you should subscribe to
Vsauce for more LÜT.

50
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,679
And as always,

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,360
thanks for watching.
