00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,279
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,709
Fear gives us life.
Being afraid of the right things kept our

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:23,819
ancestors alive. It makes sense to be afraid
of poisonous insects or hungry tigers, but

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,779
what about fear when there is no clear and
obvious danger?

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,319
For instance, a Teddy Bear

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:44,419
with a full set of human teeth...or a smile.jpg.

7
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,038
There's something a little off about these

8
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,048
images. Too much mystery, and strange-ness,
but no obvious threat, the way there is with

9
00:00:53,049 --> 00:01:00,279
a gun or falling rock. But, yet, they still
insight fear, because they are creepy.

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:10,209
But why? What gives us the creeps? 
What causes something to be creepy?

11
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,979
We are now in my bedroom, the bedroom I grew
up in, in Kansas. Like a lot of children my

12
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,029
age, I was terrified of "Scary Stories to
Tell in the Dark." But the very first book

13
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,599
that ever scared me was "The Curse of the
Squirrel." To this day, I still haven't finished

14
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,829
the book...but that's just me.

15
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:37,029
Psychologist James Geer developed the "Fear
Survey Schedule II," which he used to find

16
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,069
out what scared us the most. Combined with
the results of a more recent Gallup poll,

17
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:51,299
these are the things that scare most of us,
the most. All of these things are scary, but

18
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,599
are they creepy? Let's get more specific.

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,179
I love the way Stephen King delineates three
types of scary stuff. The first is the "gross-out".

20
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:09,439
This is something disgusting, morbid, diseased.
The second is "horror". Horror, to King, is

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:17,128
the unnatural: a giant spider, or being grabbed
in the dark when you thought you were alone.

22
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:26,628
The third, "terror," is different, creepier.
He says terror is coming home to find that

23
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:36,649
everything that you own has been replaced with
an exact copy. Terror is feeling something

24
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,399
behind you. It's breath on your neck. Knowing
that you will be grabbed, but then turning

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,608
around to find that there was never anything
there in the first place. Not a lot of research

26
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:57,388
has been done on that feeling, the creeps.
But many theories and ideas involve vagueness,

27
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:05,238
ambiguity.
For instance, masks, and why clowns are creepy.

28
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:11,378
Claude Levi-Strauss wrote that the facial
disguise temporarily eliminates from social

29
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:17,498
intercourse the part of the body, which reveals
personal feelings and attitudes. Part of the

30
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:24,608
reason even a neutral or happy mask can be
creepy may have to do with ambiguity. A mask

31
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:30,168
hides the true emotions and intentions of
the person underneath. I don't know if the

32
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:36,399
person wearing that mask is a threat or not.

33
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,979
Vagueness is creepy when it comes to the human
form. This is the famous Uncanny Valley.

34
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,289
On a chart of humanness, there's a zone where
something can be almost entirely human, but

35
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,979
off by just a little. Not so wrong that it's
clearly fake or funny, or so good that it's

36
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,108
indistinguishable. Instead, it's just troubling.

37
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:09,839
The creepiness of the Uncanny Valley is wonderfully
demonstrated by John Bergeron's Singing Androids.

38
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,018
Watch these videos when you're alone.

39
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:22,689
A similar, uneasy feeling comes from ShayeSaintJohn,
a character created by Eric Fournier. Funny

40
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,519
to some, nightmare fuel to others.

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,159
Uncanny humanoids, like all creepy things,
straddle a line between two regions that we

42
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,589
can understand and explain with language.
Francis T. McAndrew and Sara Koehnke describe

43
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:47,899
being "creeped out" as an adaptive human response
to the ambiguity of threats from others.

44
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:54,249
Creepy things are kind of a threat maybe,
but they're also kind of not. So, our brains

45
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,909
don't know what to do. Some parts respond
with fear, while other parts don't, and they

46
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,709
don't know why. So, instead of achieving a
typical fear response, horror, we simply feel

47
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:18,269
uneasy, terror, creeped out. Between the mountains
of safety and danger, there is a valley of

48
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,839
creepiness, where the limits of our knowledge
and trust and security aren't very clear.

49
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:36,399
Will looking at this cause you to die one
week later? Impossible, right? Maybe that's

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,179
the terror of ambiguity.

51
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:47,509
We don't do well with ambiguity. When it involves
our own intentions, it can make us lie. And

52
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:53,319
when it involves danger, but no recognizable
threat, it can make us think and feel some

53
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,179
pretty weird things. Have you ever peered
over a ledge, a railing, way high up, like,

54
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,199
so high up it made you nervous and dizzy
and felt something pushing you? Maybe even

55
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:15,389
an urge to jump? Have you ever stood on the
ledge with a loved one and realize that you

56
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:23,799
could push them? It would be that easy.
You really could do it, and maybe you do want

57
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,229
to do it, or maybe it's just cognitive dissonance.
The fact that your brain is having to deal

58
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,829
with ambiguity.

59
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,929
A recent study by Jennifer Hames at Florida
State University dubbed this the High Place

60
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:44,999
Phenomenon. When approaching a ledge and a
dangerous drop, your survival instinct kicks

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,469
in and you pull yourself away. But, your balance
and motor systems don't get it. Nothing is

62
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,969
pushing you and you don't normally fall or
leap randomly. So, what's going on? The part

63
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,959
of your brain that processes intention might
resolve this by determining that something

64
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,529
must be pushing you. Or, that you might actually
want to jump or push your friend, even if

65
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,419
none of that is true.

66
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,369
Now, we're not done with ambiguity yet because
our language reflects the gray area of terror

67
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:28,709
and creepiness. Take a look at the word "terror"
itself. We have "horrible" and "horrific."

68
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:36,709
"Terrible" and "terrific." Why is that?
Well, through history, we never really figured out

69
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:43,779
what to call powerful experiences, because
they're both. They are full of awe...awesome.

70
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:53,959
And, they are full of aw...awful. We need
them to survive. We need fears and the creeps,

71
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,859
to understand our size, our weaknesses.
But, on the other hand, avoiding them is pretty

72
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,799
great too...The creeps is a physical reminder
that the world is vague and full of ambiguity,

73
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,219
but that we are cunning, always trying to
figure things out but, nonetheless, fragile.

74
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:24,549
Is that terrible or terrific? Well, it's both.
Which, as a creepy ghost would say, is kind

75
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,559
of boo-tiful.

76
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,699
And as always,

77
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,900
thanks for watching.
