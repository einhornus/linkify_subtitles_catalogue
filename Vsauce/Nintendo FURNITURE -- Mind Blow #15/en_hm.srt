1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,129
A real Zelda Tresure chest?

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,839
And coming soon from 7-Eleven: two cups, one straw.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,219
Vsauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow. A few
years we were treated to a functioning

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,339
NES controller coffee table.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,749
Well, here's a brand new one with custom NES

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,139
art and a place to store all your games.
Now you just need a place to store the

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,969
controller, so...

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,719
Here's a NES console coffee table with a giant

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,199
wireless controller inside. Want a more
interactive table? Check out this

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,549
four-player pong table. For instructions
on how to build this, find the link below.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,999
Alright, enough with the coffee tables.
How about dancing robots?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,669
No? How about being a robot?

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,199
This robot exoskeleton is an alternative
mobility solution for people with severe

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,899
walking impairments.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,839
It can walk upstairs and even helps you
fight the alien queen.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,029
If you want technology in the opposite
direction, just sit in this connect

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,459
powered chair. You control it with your hand motions

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,239
and we're on our way to WALL-E.
Hey, do you mind if I park my car in your house?

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,099
Eh, no problem, just let me open it.

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,779
There we go. Thanks. One innovation we
need is the public bathroom

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,519
toe-pener. It's a handle at the bottom of the
door, so you can open it with your foot.

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,798
An innovation this lady needs is an
uncomfortable looking chair that she can

23
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,318
fit in her pocket for some reason.

24
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,759
And one mini weapon that I need is this tiny crossbow.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,288
It's made of silver, gold and steel

26
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:49,599
and can even shoot flare arrows.
This loopy drawing is a euthanasia coaster

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,809
designed to send terminally ill people off

28
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,138
in a final exhilarating ride to their doom.
Which

29
00:01:55,139 --> 00:02:00,809
is pretty morbid, right? Right. So here's a
fan-made Megaman children's book cover.

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,388
It's not exactly a car that runs on garbage,

31
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:08,349
but here's an RC car that uses soda can
tabs for fuel.

32
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,059
The aluminium is mixed with sodium
hydroxide and water to create

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,419
a small hydrogen fuel cell. And here's how
to erase a CD with photonic induction

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,639
Emperor Palpatine would be proud. Finally, here's
a look at an epic new shooter from

35
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:31,899
Cave.

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:40,149
I'm gonna leave you with a riddle.

37
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,179
"With pointed fangs it sits in wait. With

38
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,519
piercing force it doles out be fate.
Over bloodless victims proclaiming its might.

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,519
Eternally joining in a single bite."

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,159
What is it?

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,179
Leave your answer in the comments below and
we're going to do the genius of the week

42
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,559
a little differently this time.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,708
It's a number scavenger hunt.
There are

44
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,809
5 clues. Each clue leads to a number.

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,208
Three clues are on this page.
One clue is at

46
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,639
Facebook.com/VsauceGaming
and the final clue is in fact number

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,238
three.

48
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,268
Find all five and add up the numbers and
give us the total.

49
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:20,568
Leave your answer in the comments below and
I'll give you a hint

50
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:24,699
for the one in fact number three.
Sodas rank.

51
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,379
Good luck.

52
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,319
And as always,

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,500
thanks for watching.
