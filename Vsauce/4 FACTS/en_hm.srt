1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,159
Come here. Come here.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,489
My webcam doesn't even work.
You know what these are?

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,959
What are they? Nuts.
You don't know what these are? Hazelnuts?

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,348
These are hazelnuts. No!
That's not what it is. They're kinda weird.

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,919
What are these one?
Those are cashews. I hate cashew nuts.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,759
I hate hazelnuts.
Do you like chocolate-covered honey comb? No.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,409
Yes, actually. Oh, you do?
Take some of these. Alright.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,409
Speaking of mixed nuts,
today we've got a whole mix of

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,758
a bunch of weird stuff.
It's not a typical episode. We're just full of

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,819
facts and bunch of people
I met over here in London. So,

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,218
enjoy.

12
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,549
I learned something.
Your eyeballs

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,029
grow when you're a kid.
Sh*t. Yeah.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,179
But once you turn 13 years old your eyeballs -

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,648
they stop growing. But you know what?
Your ears keep growing for ever.

16
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:56,718
Did you know that?
Did you drink for breakfast again?

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,349
No, no, no, no.
But apparently, like every adult's

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,939
eyeballs are like the exact same size within
a couple millimetres.

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,969
Yeah.
So your eyes are the same size as my,

20
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,068
it's just your face is different. Like shows them off better. My face is better than your face.

21
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,449
Well, that we already established. But I'm
trying to talk about the anatomy of the eye.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,219
Thanks for ruining my self-esteem instead.
Anytime.

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,559
Okay, here's a fact that'll make you feel happy.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,799
Did you know

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,169
that in a deck of cards there are so many ways to
arrange those cards

26
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,969
that when you shuffle a deck,
the order of those cards

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,579
has never ever existed on Earth

28
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,919
in history.
Yeah.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,329
So whenever you feel sad, shuffle a deck.

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,179
Set aside and say "first."

31
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,559
Three hundred and

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,699
fifty. The idea was not really great in this
weight-lifting room,

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,259
but I need to be here because I ate a
bunch of liquid nitrogen

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,019
ice cream a couple days ago. It's this
place where they take liquid cream and

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,219
sugar and all the ingredients

36
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,309
and rather than spend a bunch of time
waiting for it to cool down,

37
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,928
they fill up a big ol' jug with liquid nitrogen

38
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,679
that freezes the cream in a matter of
seconds into delicious ice cream.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,208
They even serve the toppings out of
beakers and test tubes,

40
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,059
and it was delicious. After eating the
ice cream we stumbled upon an electric

41
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,159
harp player

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,799
and she told me after the show that even
though the harp's electric, the strings

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,809
are still made the traditional way -

44
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,969
out of the intestines of animals.

45
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,359
Of course, you have to admit that the
only thing more delicious than liquid

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,009
nitrogen

47
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,759
ice cream or animal intestines is a cake
in the face

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,109
by iJustine.

49
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,369
I leave you with British Pathé.
These guys have been filming human

50
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,089
activities

51
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,509
since we could film human activities and
they're putting all that content

52
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,249
out on the YouTube for free right now.
They've got early Arnold,

53
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,339
they've got chickens being
hatched in a frying pan

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:08,059
and old taxidermy museum
and, of course, dogs getting married.

55
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,659
Would you subscribe to British Pathé?

56
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,829
[Hazel:] I think so.
[Michael:] Yeah. Of course. As should all of you.

57
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,489
Subscribe to Vsauce if you haven't.
[Hazel:] Oh my god, you're checking me again!

58
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,289
And as always,

59
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,850
thanks for watching.
