1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,079
Hey Vsauce!

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,208
Michael here.

3
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:18,439
And here.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,709
Michael here!

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,579
hey vsauce!

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,709
what is here?

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,819
…. what is there?

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,659
what is there?

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,769
What REALLY exists?

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,718
Do waves exist or are there just things that
are wavy?

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,009
When does a piece of food I’ve eaten stop
being food and become me?

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,808
Do chairs exist?

13
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:49,819
Ontology is the philosophy of existence.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:58,419
And chairs are what philosophers call ORDINARY
OBJECTS.

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,539
Ordinary objects are the plain old common
sense things we deal with every day: spoons,

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,669
buckets, rocks, stuff like that.

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,439
Their existence is as obvious as possible

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:19,969
but the more we try to sus out where they
are, the more sus they become.

19
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,219
First of all, sure, this could all be a dream.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,969
Maybe we’ve all been hallucinating chairs
all these years.

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,609
Or this could part of the simulated reality
pumped into our brains while our bodies are

22
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,069
harvested for energy.

23
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,449
But underneath that skepticism there’s a
deeper ONTOLOGICAL question that we need to

24
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,359
answer first.

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,989
Regardless of whether this spoon is made of
real atoms or simulated atoms, is it really

26
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,199
possible to be “made of” something?

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,039
Take a look at these two things.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,249
As we all know, two minus one is … TWO?!

29
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,449
There ARE two things here:

30
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,759
An origami crane AND a piece of paper.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,119
I’m kidding, of course, there’s really
just one: the crane and the piece of paper

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,229
are the same.

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:25,939
But watch this.

34
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:32,369
Where’d the crane go?

35
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,589
If the paper and the crane were truly identical,
they would share everything in common.

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,649
But clearly they don’t: the paper can survive
being unfolded, the crane cannot.

37
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,389
Also, I made the crane, but I didn’t make
the paper.

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,729
And the paper was around before the crane.

39
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,709
For two things that are the same, they sure
are different.

40
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,929
This relationship is called CONSTITUTION:
paper constitutes the crane.

41
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,719
It’s a one-to-one relationship, but there’s
another kind of “being made of” going

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,489
on here, too.

43
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:14,539
This paper is made not of ONE other thing,
but of sextillions of things: fundamental

44
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,079
subatomic particles: electrons and quarks,
or strings, or physical and virtual fields.

45
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,089
This many-to-one relationship is called COMPOSITION.

46
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,959
Philosophers call whatever it is that matter
is ultimately composed of SIMPLES: a simple

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,179
is a thing that, unlike a piece of paper,
has no parts.

48
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,409
No substructure.

49
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,598
Not even a top or bottom.

50
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,979
It could be the case that there are no simples,
that there’s just a never-ending chain of

51
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,809
smaller and smaller substructure.

52
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,159
Philosophers call such a reality a GUNKY universe.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,939
If structure never ends in the other direction
and everything turns out to be part of something

54
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,079
bigger with no final complete composite, that’s
what’s known as a JUNKY universe.

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,049
Point is: believing ordinary objects exist
and are made up of smaller things is quite

56
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,049
common.

57
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,269
It’s called ontological reductionism.

58
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,339
It’s the position that wholes are NOTHING
MORE than their parts.

59
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,068
But our cranes and our paper challenge that notion.
it seems like being MADE OF some things IS different than

60
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,599
just BEING those things.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,249
Let’’s agree on what it means to exist.

62
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:36,019
Let’s say that for something to exist is
simply for there to be more than zero of it.

63
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,349
Pegasus exists if we mean “are there any
winged horses in works of fiction and mythology?”

64
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:48,399
And pegasus does not exist if we mean, “are
there any physical, flesh-and-blood winged

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,079
horses that evolved on Earth through natural
selection.”

66
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,759
okay, so if we can agree on that, then of course chairs
exist!

67
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,579
There’s this one right here.

68
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,349
I can see it and feel it and taste it.

69
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,909
yea. It’s dry and .. a little bit salty.

70
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,529
Dry and salty are what we call PROPERTIES.

71
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,179
Properties tell us what things are LIKE.

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,759
For example, this slice of cheese is FLOPPY.

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,198
By noticing and sharing properties, we can
let each other know what to expect from things.

74
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,249
And we all more or less agree on what things
there are.

75
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,629
We give names to stuff and if they catch on,
we put them in dictionaries with the word

76
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,399
“noun” next to them.

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,649
But are all of these nouns an inventory of
the universe … or an inventory of things

78
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,649
we MADE?

79
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,138
Let me put it this way: do islands exist?

80
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:51,669
Well, it’s in the dictionary and a quick
look around confirms that there are more than

81
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,649
zero islands, so yes.

82
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,698
Islands exist.

83
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,259
But what about incars?

84
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,849
An incar is a car that is IN a garage.

85
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:11,809
As a car leaves a garage, an incar diminishes
at the threshold until it collapses into nonexistence.

86
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,349
Later, an extremely similar incar may emerge
at the same threshold when the car returns.

87
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,799
Are there any cars in garages right now?

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,839
If so, then incars exist.

89
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,509
You might be thinking, “that’s not a thing.

90
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,999
you just made that up.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,508
And it’s silly: “being in a garage”
is just a property that a car can have.

92
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,619
Stop trying to make incars a thing.”

93
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,909
Ok, first of all, I didn’t make it up, Eli
Hirsch did.

94
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:50,409
And second of all, if you think incars aren’t
things, wait till you hear about islands.

95
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,379
An incar might just be a relation between
a car and a garage but an island is just a

96
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,219
relation between land and some water.

97
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,129
Now, “island” might be a more useful concept
than “incar,” but does that make islands

98
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,449
OBJECTIVELY more real than incars?

99
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,459
And what about trogs?

100
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,369
A trog is an object whose parts are a tree
and whatever dog is nearest.

101
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,019
Here’s a picture of one.

102
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,209
Do you see the trog? this is its tree part
and this is its dog part.

103
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,659
You might be thinking, come on, how can THAT
be a thing?

104
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,399
The tree and the dog aren’t even connected!

105
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,599
well so what?

106
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,259
These two pieces of fabric aren’t connected
and yet they’re a thing called a bikini.

107
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,819
Now sure, if we cut down this tree and burn
it for warmth, we wouldn’t feel the need

108
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,439
to apologize to what’s left of the trog
for destroying its tree part.

109
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,709
But maybe we should?

110
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,269
What if some extraterrestrials showed up and
said they thought dogs and trees composed

111
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,699
trogs — would they be wrong?

112
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,109
Could we convince the otherwise?

113
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,409
Ontological realists believe that we could.

114
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,489
That there really is a mind-independent answer
to the question, “what is there?”

115
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,198
People like Theodore Sider believe that the
universe has “joints” and we can cut up reality

116
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,129
up into objective, real things by finding
them.

117
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,228
Ontological anti-realists disagree.

118
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,499
Their position is that what we think there
is is just one way to cut up reality.

119
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,819
It’s a good one for us and our needs, but
it’s not objectively more true than any

120
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,819
other.

121
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,819
So who’s right?

122
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:43,319
Hmm… well if these blocks compose
a tower … what do they compose now?

123
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,849
Just because we don’t have a name for .. this..
doesn’t necessary mean that I haven’t

124
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,179
accidentally built something. Does it?

125
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,059
When DO two or more things compose something
else?

126
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,959
Peter Van Inwagen calls this the special composition
question.

127
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,619
In MATERIAL BEINGS he considers possible answers:
maybe things compose something only when they’re

128
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,619
in contact.

129
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,819
That’s a good thought, but it doesn’t
explain how a BIKINI can be a thing.

130
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,289
Or why two books are still just two books
when one is stacked on top of the other.

131
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,609
you know,

132
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,049
Maybe a certain degree of FIXATION is required.

133
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,049
Or a ‘melding’ … if a surgeon sewed
us together and the skin healed with no seam

134
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,689
and we shared the same blood supply … you
know, even then it would seem wrong to say

135
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,829
that we’d become some new kind of animal.

136
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,009
There’d still just me and you.

137
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,219
But like, stuck together.

138
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,159
The philosophy of parts and wholes is called
mereology and

139
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,199
Mereological Universalism is the belief that
there’s an answer to the special composition question

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:59,578
and the answer is this: any assortment of stuff, no matter
how strange or scattered across time and space

141
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,028
composes a thing.

142
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,419
some pages compose these books but I don't just have two books here. Oh no, there's also a third thing

143
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,779
let's call it a "took" because it's parts are Two Books.

144
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:17,539
There is also something composed of my left ear,
the northern third of every brown trout in

145
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,759
England, and the Eiffel tower.

146
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,909
Just because it has no name and no one’s
ever talked about it before just shows a lack

147
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,049
of intrest on our parts.

148
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,649
To a universalist, eliminating some composites
but not others is just too arbitrary.

149
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,279
We may as well accept them all.

150
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,299
Eliminativism is any belief that accepts some
composites, but eliminates others.

151
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,398
Peter Van Inwagen, for example, believes that
there are no ordinary objects, no chairs or

152
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,219
shirts or shoes.

153
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,109
Right here there are just some simples — atoms or whatever
— arragned show-wise.

154
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,549
There isn;t something else here called a shoe.

155
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,969
But he thinks that because people believe
they themselves exist, and he can’t see

156
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,979
how something could believe it existed without
existing in the first place to even think

157
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,479
that, there must be people.

158
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,119
He goes further, though, to argue that ALL
living thigns exist.

159
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,489
While admiting he doesn’t have any “knock-down”
agruments in their favor, he mentions that

160
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,948
because simples that are part of a living
organism maintain the organism — 

161
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:28,338
— while shedding some members and gaining
others, all while remaining individuated from

162
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:35,119
other organisms, unlike, say, waves of water
at the moment of collision, clearly, simples

163
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,409
in the act of a life must compose something.

164
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,169
That position is ORAGANICISM.

165
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:48,359
It’s been called the belief that people
exist, but that none of them wear clothes.

166
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,479
Mereological Nihilism is less generous.

167
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,479
It’s the belief that there aren’t any
trogs or incars OR dogs or trees.

168
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,439
Because nothing ever composes.

169
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,588
The nihilist doesn’t believe that there
is NOTHING here.

170
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,689
There are lots of simples, but that’s it.

171
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,528
That might sound puzzling: how can a bunch
of fundamental particles, arranged into atoms

172
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,879
and molecules that are arranged like this
NOT be a chair?

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,169
That’s JUST IS what a chair is!

174
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,789
Good question.

175
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,809
Let’s call that deflationism: the belief
that this is all silly and that all of these

176
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,829
positions are talking past each other: they
all agree on what reality contains: they all

177
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,659
believe that there are simples here and that
those simples are arranged in a chair shape.

178
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,909
Since that’s just what a chair IS, they
all believe in chairs.

179
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:49,229
Those who say they don’t just being weird
and contrarian.

180
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,739
Deflationism has many supporters.

181
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,249
And it truly is the heart of our issue today.

182
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:01,349
But to address it, we should first see why
it would be nice if all of these parts did not

183
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,429
form a chair.

184
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:09,369
Let’s begin with over-determination: If
chairs really do exist, shouldn’t they be

185
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,579
able to interact with us?

186
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:16,749
The thing is, though, everything this alleged
chair can do can be described by referencing the behavior of

187
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,719
simples here and any other simples
that come along.

188
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,249
An account of the activities of every ATOM in this room, leaves nothing

189
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,669
for the chair to explain.

190
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,229
Composites are causally redundant.

191
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,259
Believing in chairs is like believing that,
while yes, the burning gas from my stove completely

192
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:44,219
describes why the water in a pot boils, there’s
ALSO a magical invisible substance called

193
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,229
boil-o that comes out of my stove that does
the same thing as the flame at the same time

194
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,619
and if there was no boil-o the flame would
warm the water just the same, but there is

195
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,199
boil-o.

196
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,898
Chairs are no more real than boil-o.

197
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,859
Composites over-determine what happens in the world.

198
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,719
They also lead to over-COUNTING.

199
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,099
For more on that, let’s say hello to this
video’s sponsor.

200
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,099
Hi.

201
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,729
I’m Michael Stevens.

202
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,539
You may know me from such films as ”Lady
Gaga - Judas PARODY!

203
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,319
Key Of Awesome #42” and The Emoji Movie.

204
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,819
But today, I’m here to talk to you about
the Curiosity Box.

205
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,669
This season, subscribers will be receiving
many things, including a shirt celebrating

206
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:39,398
the Sherman line, a kit to find out what bacteria
is growing on you, a puzzle that celebrates

207
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:47,638
the average color of neptune and yes, uranus,
and the first ever at-home demonstration of

208
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,259
impossible colors.

209
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,229
And right now, if you subscribe with code BOGO, we’ll
also send you our entire summer box  completely free.

210
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,319
just pay shipping

211
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,569
How many THINGS will you be receiving for
one ridiculously low price?

212
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,719
You might think 15: 8 things plus 7 things.

213
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,719
 

214
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,509
But don’t forget that you’re ALSO
getting this entire collection and THIS entire collection.

215
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,888
That’s 17 things!

216
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:16,888
ORder now.

217
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,039
That’s a good deal, but the ontology seemed
wrong.

218
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,459
If I count some parts, I shouldn’t also
count the whole they compose.

219
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,219
But if you believe in composite objects you
MUST do this, right?

220
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,669
After all, the composite exists.

221
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:41,069
So if this chair contains, say, 100 sextillion
atoms, then there are actually AT LEAST 100

222
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:47,409
sextillion and one things here: all of these
atoms and also a chair.

223
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,039
That seems wrong.. but wait, there’s more.

224
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,419
If I take a knife and scrape off a tiny part
of this chair … is it still a chair?

225
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,719
I think most of us would say yes.

226
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,979
It would still be a chair even if I removed
a tiny bit again.

227
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,979
And again.

228
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,159
A series of tiny innocuous removals is called
a SORITES SEQUENCE.

229
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,059
The trouble they cause is that while it seems
we must accept that each individual step doesn’t

230
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:24,659
annihilate the chair, clearly, ENOUGH minute
removals WILL eventually leave us with no

231
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,189
chair.

232
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,489
Nothing at all, in fact.

233
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,148
But how can that be?

234
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:34,599
How subtracting zero over and over again EVER
give a different result?

235
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,708
Clearly, there must be a point at which a
tiny change DOES make a difference.

236
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:46,039
Different people might give different answers
as to where that line is — but, you know,

237
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,729
we could just stipulate the boundaries: we
could define “chair” in some extreamly

238
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,229
precise way.

239
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,299
If we did that, if we defined the shape, function,
history, and use that makes something a chair

240
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,490
so precisely that the even the smallest deviation
would make or break its status as a chair

241
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:07,778
… how could we know if it’d done it right?

242
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:13,719
If we called up God and said, “hey dude,
watch this, see this chair?

243
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,288
Okay, now we’re going to remove a single
atom from it.

244
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:18,528
Ta da!

245
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:20,999
It’s no longer a chair is it?”

246
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,078
Would God would be like, “pwha!

247
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,518
Correct! you guys nailed it.

248
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,068
That is exactly right.

249
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:33,978
It was a chair before and now, in my infinite
wisdom, I can confirm that that single atom

250
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:38,089
was what made the difference.”

251
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,608
Unless there’s some explanation for why
a boundary should be drawn in a precise way

252
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:48,629
instead of some other way, our stipulations
are just arbitrary.

253
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,858
Ordinary objects may be unredeemably vague.

254
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:58,158
But being vague may actually be a feature of ordinary
objects.

255
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,608
For example, how many people is a crowd?

256
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:07,508
10 people standing together in a huge empty
park might be more of a group, but 10 people

257
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:13,108
standing further apart in a tiny waiting room
will feel way more CROWDED.

258
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:18,498
The fact that our terms depend on context,
that they’re PLASTIC, make it seem less

259
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:23,918
and less like they’re describing THINGS
and more and more like they’re pragmatic.

260
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,459
That rather than telling what there is, they
tell us to expect.

261
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,058
Peter Unger has pointed out that there’s
at least one kind of thing that CAN survive

262
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:38,798
a sorities sequence without paradox: stuff.

263
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,248
If you innocuously remove pieces from something
that is just “some stuff” you will still

264
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:52,108
have some stuff after each step until you
reach a clear and unambiguous boundary: when

265
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:57,118
the last piece is removed, there will no longer
be any stuff.

266
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,988
This might show that there ARE composite objects:
stuff.

267
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:08,268
As soon as we pretend that some stuff is a
THING, though, vagueness sets in.

268
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:13,608
Suddenly we’re talking about a thing that
can lose parts but also can’t lose parts

269
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:19,368
and unless contradictions can exist, words
like “chair” don’t really refer to any

270
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:21,839
thing in the universe.

271
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,449
Sorites seqeunces lead to other problems,
too.

272
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,388
Like: the PROBLEM OF THE MANY.

273
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:36,488
If removing a tiny number of atoms from this chair still
leaves me with a chair, how many chairs are

274
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:37,488
here?

275
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:39,798
I mean, there’s this one.

276
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:48,038
And then there’s this one, which is really similar to the first but doesn't have these atoms on top of

277
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,038
it.

278
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,268
I don’t even have to remove atoms for this
to be a problem.

279
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:56,849
All I have to do try to define which atoms
here are part of the chair and which aren’t.

280
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,089
At the atomic level, there isn’t a definite
boundary.

281
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,388
Near the edge, it will hard to tell whether
a particular molecule is part of the moisture

282
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:09,119
in the chair or part of the ambient humidity.

283
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,638
Instead of there being a single chair here,
it seems like REALLY there are billions and

284
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:18,348
billions of candidates for the chair.

285
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:21,618
Which one is the chair?

286
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:26,579
But now, suppose that instead of removing
pieces like in a sorities sequences or choosing

287
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,308
pieces like in the problem of the many, we
instead discard pieces and replace them with

288
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,469
new, similar pieces.

289
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,258
This is the set up to the famous SHIP OF THESEUS
paradox.

290
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:43,939
Suppose I buy a boat and name it THESEUS.

291
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,109
Over time, parts of the boat wear out and
I replace them with brand new parts.

292
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,768
After, say 10 years, I might realize that
not a single part of my boat was part of the

293
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,558
boat on the day I bought it.

294
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,648
Do I now own a different boat?

295
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:59,528
Have I owned TWO boats?

296
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:04,048
But now suppose the someone has been following
me all these years and has been picking up

297
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:08,598
each old part I throw out and storing them
in a warehouse.

298
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,732
After I replaced all the original parts they
take them and join them back the way

299
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,298
they way there were 10 years ago.

300
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,538
Which boat is THESEUS?

301
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,538
Both?

302
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:26,189
If we conclude that ordinary objects don’t
exist, the problems of sorites, the many,

303
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,349
theseus, over-determination, and over-counting
all evaporate.

304
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:38,278
If there are only simples and they never compose
anything, then which one is the ship of theseus

305
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:41,449
is easy to answer: neither!

306
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,819
Neither are the boat and nothing ever was
the boat.

307
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,308
All that happened was that some simples got
moved around.

308
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:53,829
The simples the scavenger has are the simples
I possessed when I bought the boat, but there’s

309
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,878
no mystery of persistence: removing or exchanging
a piece of stuff never left me with the same

310
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:00,949
stuff.

311
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:08,219
There’s no mystery as to which of the billions
of chair candidates here is THE chair and

312
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,719
the removal of no specific atoms will ever
stop it from being a chair because it there

313
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,848
is no chair here and there never was.

314
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:20,258
There are only simples arranged chair-wise.

315
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:26,178
The illusion that there ARE composites
that can survive changes in parts is an artifact

316
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,178
of our minds.

317
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:33,009
It’s a helpful one that allows us to track
certain properties and ignore others, but

318
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,639
when taken seriously, it obviously isn’t
really how the universe works.

319
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,639
And that’s okay.

320
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,139
We shouldn’t be embarassed when we talk
about boats or chairs.

321
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,099
Our words for ordinary objects really do refer
to actual phenomena and therefore are more

322
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:55,048
correct than believing that, say, the sun
turned into a black hole yesterday.

323
00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:00,479
Unlike the false statement that chairs exist,
there is NO evidence saying the sun turned

324
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,839
into a black hole yesterday could even be
INCORRECTLY describing.

325
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,918
Because of this, Trenton Merricks calls the
belief in ordinary objects false but, “nearly

326
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,788
as good as true.”

327
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:16,969
This is all silly, though, right?

328
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,138
Of course there are chairs.

329
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:24,018
If you believe that there are some simples
arranged chair-wise, then you admit that there’s

330
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,018
a chair!

331
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:27,219
Because that’s just what a chair IS.

332
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,058
It’s not some additional THING over-and-above
these simples: it just IS them.

333
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:39,839
Each is still an atom or electron or whatever,
but TOGETHER they are a chair.

334
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,079
Not so fast there, chair-lover.

335
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,079
 

336
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,699
What do you MEAN “a chair IS simples arranged
chair-wise?”

337
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,839
the phrase “simples arranged chair-wise”
just picks out these simples.

338
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,178
There’s nothing else for that phrase to
refer to.

339
00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:00,288
There aren’t all of these simples and then
ALSO some OTHER simples that are the simples

340
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:02,339
arranged chair-wise.

341
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,959
So do you mean that “chair” is a disguised
plural?

342
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,558
That it refers to lots of things like the
phrase “these books”?

343
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:16,288
Because “these books” only commits us
to the existence of this book and this book

344
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,808
but not an additional single
object that’s called a “these books.”

345
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:27,878
Likewise, if “chair” just means this simple
and this simple and this simple, then it points

346
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:33,858
to a whole bunch of things and not one of
them is a chair.

347
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:39,618
Sure, “chairs” exist if by chair we mean
a word for all these simples.

348
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:46,368
But if by chair we mean an actual object in
the universe, there just aren’t any, my

349
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:47,368
friend.

350
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:53,248
Except… maybe there is no chair over-and-above
the simples, but instead something happens

351
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:57,509
when an assortment of simples are arranged
into a chair-shape.

352
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:04,028
Each member continues to be a single atom
or whatever, but COLLECTIVELY they all simultaneously

353
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:07,239
BECOME one thing: a chair.

354
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:14,018
Okay, so then either there’s no chair here,
just simples; or somehow a miraculous contradiction

355
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:20,589
has appeared: many things and ALSO one thing
that, despite both clearly differing in that

356
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,038
respect, are still identical!

357
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,859
It looks like chairs can’t be identical
to the parts they’re supposedly composed

358
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,089
of..

359
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,678
but chairs also can’t be DIFFERENT from
their composite parts because there’s nothing

360
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:40,648
else there and, after counting and accounting
for their parts, there’s nothing left for

361
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:45,719
the existence of a chair to cause or explain.

362
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,668
To rescue chairs from non-existence, we need
to find a way to show that a chair is independent

363
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:58,998
of its atoms — and therefore distinct from
them — but not SO distinct that it’s impossibly

364
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,898
over-and-above them.

365
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:05,739
We need to find a way to make chairs ONTOLOGICALLY
INNOCENT.

366
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,719
To have our cake and not have it, too.

367
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,579
Amie Thomasson does this in a very clever
way.

368
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,859
She points out that if I ask you, “hey,
is there anything in the fridge?” and you

369
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,808
open it, see that’s it empty, and say, “there’s
nothing in here” it would be weird if I

370
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:29,839
came over, looked inside, found a single eyelash
in the corner and said, “ummm EXCUSE me?

371
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,599
What is this?! you said there was no THING
in the fridge, but there was an eyelash and,

372
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,618
gosh dangit, the whole things is actually
FULL!

373
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:40,618
Of AIR.”

374
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:44,888
That would be weird because when I asked if
there was anything in the fridge, it was implied

375
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:48,089
that I meant anything TO EAT.

376
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,468
By arguing that the empty fridge is not REALLY
empty, I was using the word “thing” in

377
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:56,199
what Thomasson calls a “neutral sense.”

378
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,628
I used it to mean any and all entities that
could possibly be described.

379
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:07,339
But you took me to be using “thing” in
what she calls a “sortal” sense.

380
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,038
A sortal is a term that tells us what a thing
is in way that allows us to count how many

381
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:16,329
there are AND know when there is or isn’t
one.

382
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,288
“Water” is not a sortal.

383
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:22,349
If I told you there was water in my basement
and you asked, “how many waters?”

384
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,058
I’d have to use a sortal to answer you.

385
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:27,879
For example, “gallons of water.”

386
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,839
Thomasson argues that the neutral use of “thing”
is meaningless when used to ask questions.

387
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,398
For example, if I used thing in a neutral sense and asked how many orange things are in this video

388
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,108
you would have no idea how I wanted you to carve it all up

389
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:46,829
thus, there would be no would be no single correct answer.

390
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,728
You might say, "uh, one orange thing? Your shirt?"

391
00:27:50,729 --> 00:28:00,498
But then I could say, “what, no there's my left sleeve, my right sleeve, the inside of the shirt, the outside of the shirt. Come on, there's way more than one."

392
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:06,388
Unless we use a sortal net, any search for
what things there are will end in confusion.

393
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:10,829
Not because there are no things, but because
it hasn’t been made clear what conditions

394
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,548
to apply when searching.

395
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:19,298
For Thomasson, this means that what we find
depends on what APPLICATION CONDITIONS we

396
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,298
use.

397
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:25,548
If I ask if there’s anything here that the
condition “smaller than a molecule” applies

398
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:30,058
to, you could note each such thing and give
me an inventory.

399
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,199
“Chair” would not be on the list.

400
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,508
But if I asked you if there were any medium-sized
rigid-acording-to human strength things here,

401
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:44,979
“chair” would probably go on your list,
and no single atom would.

402
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:51,778
If an application condition is satisfied in
the wrold, then the thing is descrbes exists.

403
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,848
So CHAIRS do exist.

404
00:28:55,849 --> 00:29:00,339
If the application conditions for one thing
are also sufficient for something else, then,

405
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:05,878
if we find the first thing, we have found
the other because it’s existence is entailed

406
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:12,148
ANLYTICALLY by the existence of the first
thing — that is, by meaning and logic alone.

407
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:16,959
For example, if I say that I live in a house
you can conclude — without looking! — that

408
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,998
I live in a building.

409
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:23,319
There’s no paradox here, I don’t live
in a house AND a building — two distinct

410
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,898
things that defy the laws of physics by being
co-located.

411
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:32,459
Instead, the conditions that apply to a house
are also sufficient for building.

412
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,168
So a single chair is not impossibly identical
to some collection of many.

413
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:41,268
Nor is it somehow over-and-above its parts.

414
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:47,608
Instead, atoms arranged chair-wise merely
logically ENTAIL a chair.

415
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:52,848
The entailment connects things differentiated
by distinct application conditions.

416
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:58,488
When we ask which one is the ship of theseus,
a puzzle erupts because we’re being too

417
00:29:58,489 --> 00:29:59,488
neutral.

418
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:04,249
We need to say what we mean by “ship of
theseus”: if we mean the original parts,

419
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,599
then this is it.

420
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,449
Do we mean the thing registered to me by the
boat authorities?

421
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,469
well then it’s this one.

422
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,638
“But which is the REAL one” is an incomplete
pseudoquestion.

423
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:20,439
When it come to sorites sequences, I think
we need to just stipulate where the boundary

424
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,439
is.

425
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,230
I don’t think there’s an objective answer
provided by the universe or God as to exactly

426
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:31,898
what is and isn’t a chair, but that doesn’t
HAVE to mean that there aren’t any chairs,

427
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:38,228
it can just mean that every single collection
of simples is it’s own unique object independent

428
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:43,949
of our minds and that we get to decide which
we will call chairs.

429
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:50,699
Vagueness comes from our minds and our language
but there are no vague objects in the universe.

430
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:57,329
We don’t have to believe that our reality
is simulated, but I do think we have to believe

431
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,478
that it’s stipulated: it is a reality that
contains not what intelligent machines have

432
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:07,528
decided to give us, but what we have decided
we have.

433
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:13,308
There’s no fact of the matter as to whether
calling this a star is the TRUE way to carve

434
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:14,368
up this stuff.

435
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:20,178
It’s a pretty useful way to do it, and helpful
for at least human purposes, but “STAR”

436
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:24,018
is a thing WE imposed on the world.

437
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:29,349
As Michael Jubien puts it, “there are no
things, but as a consequence there are as

438
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,939
many things as we like.”

439
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,848
As for the problem of the many, we can simply
just admit that there really are billions

440
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:40,099
of slightly different chairs here.

441
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:45,388
Some include a few boundary atoms that others
don’t, but since they all act and react

442
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:51,038
pretty much in unison, in our daily lives
it doesn’t matter which exact material collection

443
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,958
we mean when we say “this chair.”

444
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:59,638
However, let’s go back to our cranes.

445
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,538
When we talked about holes we said that holes
might be ONTOLOGICALLY parasitic.

446
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:09,678
That their existence seems to require the
existence of something ELSE: something that

447
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,499
can HOST the hole.

448
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,548
Perhaps this crane is holey, too.

449
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:21,118
Not a physical thing in its own right, but
a disturbance IN some paper.

450
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,528
There is no material crane here, there is
only some paper that is arranged crane-wise.

451
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:31,965
But once we start entertaining that notion,
we realize that nearly EVERYTHING we see and feel

452
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:38,346
all ordinary obejcts and even ourselves are ontological parasites

453
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:42,798
Michael Jubien calls our tendency to think
that what is true of a “chair” is true

454
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,518
of the material that is chairing OBJECT FIXATION
or PROPERTY REPRESSION.

455
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,129
Object fixation is useful and “nearly as
good as true” but when paradxoes loom, we

456
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:01,008
should remember that while chairs exist, they
aren’t made out of matter and can’t be

457
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:04,028
touched or or felt or tasted.

458
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:08,709
All I can do is taste some stuff while it
chairs.

459
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:14,638
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck,
and quacks like a duck, then it’s not a

460
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,838
duck, but it is arranged duck-wise.

461
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:25,409
I think that the only concrete physical things
in our universe are simples — or, since

462
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:31,408
our universe could be gunky — the material
world only contains stuff.

463
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:37,569
And yes, this stuff is chair-ing, but the
road paved by the idea that that makes this

464
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,569
stuff A chair leads to paradox.

465
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,898
To see how we could have made that mistake,
let’s remember the famous Clintonian dictum

466
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:51,099
that often “it depends on what the meaning
of “is” is”

467
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:57,548
There’s the “is” of predication, which
tells us what some thing is like, as in, this

468
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:00,738
cheese IS floppy.

469
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:05,978
And then there’s the “is” of identity
which tells us what is the same as what for

470
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:09,417
example, 2+2 IS 4.

471
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:14,299
To believe that chairs are made of matter
— to be believe that YOU are made of matter

472
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,189
— is to confuse these two ISes.

473
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,428
When a collection of properties are extremely
thorough in telling us what to expect from

474
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:28,767
some stuff, we tend to just go ahead and NOUN
them: collapse them into a single word and

475
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:34,017
believe it doesn’t just describe some stuff,
but REFERS to it.

476
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:38,279
I think we have an intuitive sense of the
thoroughness of properties and this can be

477
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,598
seen in how we order our adjectives.

478
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,308
“Big” can mean many things.

479
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:49,638
A big diamond and big house are very different
in size.

480
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,398
“Blue” tells me a bit more about what
to expect, but CHEESEBURGER, oooh that’s

481
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,398
specific.

482
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,209
So specific, in fact, that we call it a noun.

483
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:05,679
This increasing thoroughness may be partly
responsible for the fact that “big blue

484
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,809
cheseburger” sounds fine, but blue big cheeseburger”
sounds kind of weird.

485
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:18,858
When we embrace the idea that cheseburgers
are not physical objects, but instead, exist

486
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:25,788
as an abstract set of properties like juicy,
warm, soft, and so on, the specter of ontolgical

487
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:28,749
paradox dissipates.

488
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,449
You and I are not physical objects either.

489
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,189
“Michael-ing” is a bunch of different
properties and most of them are very vague.

490
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:43,429
They include things like, “knowing who Kevin
is, being more or less a certain height, having

491
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,528
a roughly continous relationship with the
stuff that Mcihaeled yesterday and that that’s

492
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,818
Michael-ing today” and so.

493
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:54,249
Some of what it means to Michael does concern
composition, like, the fact that I will still

494
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,209
exist even if I shave off the stuff I call
my beard.

495
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,528
If I shaved off my beard, there would still
be some stuff Michael-ing, but it would be

496
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:05,929
different stuff than before.

497
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:15,098
We’re able to lose parts and change and
grow because we aren’t made of matter, we’re

498
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:16,098
hosted by matter.

499
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:18,098
There’s no thing that is you and no thing
that is ME.

500
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:24,048
As Alan Watts would say, the universe doesn’t
contain people, the universe PEOPLES.

501
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:33,409
Chairs and tables and rocks and buckets and people are not made of atoms, they are preformed by atoms.

502
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:40,642
We are disturbances in stuff and none of it
is us.

503
00:36:40,643 --> 00:36:44,649
This stuff right here is not me. It's just me-ing.

504
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:50,909
We are not the universe seeing itself, we
ARE the seeing.

505
00:36:50,910 --> 00:37:00,409
I am not a thing that dies and becomes scattered,
I AM death and I AM the scattering
