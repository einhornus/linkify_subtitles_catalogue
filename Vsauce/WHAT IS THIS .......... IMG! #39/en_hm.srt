1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,079
Mr. T with no hair and a baby giving the peace sign

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,959
in the womb.
It's episode of 39 IMG!

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,179
When tweety bird gets

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,979
old, you're gonna have this.
And it's amazing how little

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,429
information we need to see familiar objects.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,438
It's also amazing than an iPhone can fall

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,419
13,500 feet from a sky diver's pocket

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,039
and still receive phone calls.
Well, this looks safe.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,939
Oh.
And this looks sad.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,359
Oh. This looks cool. Ohhhh.
This rock

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,808
is sad and so is food like this pear.

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,179
I mean, how could you eat such sad food?
Try a hot dog instead.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,538
No, no, no. A hot dog, like really hot.

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,409
Pepperoni sweater hot.
Prefer your dog to be a mouse pad?

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,889
Well, you might also prefer your rock paper
scissors to be more complex.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,268
Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is popular,

17
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,728
but there's also Pirate Zombie Monkey
Ninja Robot or

18
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,288
this game which uses 15 different

19
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:15,799
items.
And don't worry, there's also RPS25.

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,148
Each item has an equal chance of winning

21
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:23,678
and yes, there are explanations for each.
If remembering 25 items is too much,

22
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,859
don't worry, there is a flash game version.

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:32,348
Here's a Middle Earth Map dress and is
that Steve Buscemi on your dress or are

24
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,129
you just really saggy to see me?

25
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,788
Sorry if that came across like a pickup line.
It's just

26
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,419
I mustache you a question.
Can eyebrows

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,659
your computer?
Alright, look, no more puns. At least

28
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,788
not until after the soap opera.
BuzzFeed showcased some

29
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,909
unnecessary signs.
"Keep off the

30
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,969
grass" and yeah, no one has to tell me that.

31
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,598
So instead, here are some famous people
eating ice cream.

32
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:18,169
Enjoy.

33
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,419
Let's get charty.
I love these two

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,339
huge charts.
One is all about the atom, the nucleus,

35
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,689
the distances electrons are away from it, fission, fusion.

36
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,209
It's great. And here's one from National
Geographic that puts our universe

37
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,159
in perspective.
This graph distributes rage faces

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,209
according to happy, sad and degree of

39
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,689
energy. Now, you'll never use the wrong one.
And these maps show the most popular

40
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,319
first

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,519
names by country.
The greasy stain on this receipt has a man's

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,949
face in it. And these chairs look like they're sinking.

43
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,519
Their bottom halves have been painted
as a projection like shadows,

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,369
so that from the right angle
they come together. This

45
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,149
is the Firefox logo and this

46
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,669
is V838 Monocerotis, possibly

47
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,069
the largest star known to man.
I leave you

48
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,639
with 241543903.

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,169
Google it, click images. Ta-da.

50
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,669
