1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,289
Cacti are perpetual victims and kitten heart.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,479
It's episode 34 of IMG!

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,949
When these guys get busy,

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,048
you get this.
And when Adobe adds the force to

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,669
Photoshop, you get Adobe WanKenobi.
If other brands did the same we'd have Jedi -

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,108
Do or do not; Sith puma; Hunt it your way

7
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:25,159
or Jabba the Hutt.
There's a smiley face on the surface of Mars

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,139
and starburst region NGC 3603 is the same.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,488
Wedding photography can be mopey.
Uhmmm...

10
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,959
Packing enough heat to warm the bun in the oven.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,119
A chair within a chair within a chair
within a chair chair-ception.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,259
A tree chair

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,429
and an ergonomic... really? Let's move on to
a kitten with a permanent top hat

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,549
and some lesser-known last suppers.
Popeye,

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,808
cartoons, Team Fortress 2, other

16
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,769
video game characters and zombies.
If you're not hungry, skip the supper and just grab

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,299
a drink from Fremont coffee with

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,448
foam shaped into Batman, Darth Vader,

19
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,849
Frank from Donnie Darko or Pikachu.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,499
Though, of course, I prefer Cthulhu-achu.
They also have Boba Fett, but I prefer

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,759
girls dressed

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:24,839
as Boba Fett. Enjoy.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,039
For more action, check out Josh MC's
Disney Princess fighters -

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,559
Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Snow White

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,609
and more.
Thanks to MoIllusions.com here

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,669
is some neon vomit. Stare at the black
dot in the middle and no matter what

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,269
don't move your eyes.

28
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,479
Slowly, but surely, the surrounding
collars will disappear into the grey.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,339
Garret Steider designs alphabetical food posters.

30
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,419
If you look closely, you'll get it all over your face.

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,118
These pictures come from Mitsuko Nagone and finding them this week

32
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,398
made my week. On Facebook.com/vsaucegaming, Frederick showed us an

33
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,969
example of bad CD-rom design.

34
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,159
And Caleb's image of perfectly round circles hurt

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,428
my brain to try to understand.
Finally,

36
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,279
'Fouad' gave us these important acronyms.

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,669
And I'm not done there.
