[Michael]
Where is everyone?

2
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:10,675
We have been listening
for messages from outer space

3
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:13,611
for more than half a century,

4
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:17,515
and so far...

5
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:19,584
silence.

6
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:21,119
Why?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,190
Are we truly alone
in the universe?

8
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,226
Or is everyone else
acting like us

9
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:31,129
and just doing a lot
of listening?

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,231
Maybe we need to be louder.

11
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:36,768
Maybe we need to send
more messages out there.

12
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:39,704
But how do you write a letter
to an extraterrestrial

13
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:42,774
whose language and culture
and biology and mind

14
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:44,843
we have no concept of?

15
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,544
And what do you say?

16
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:50,782
And given all of the unknowns
about what they might be,

17
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:53,718
should we say
anything at all?

 ♪♪

19
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:15,673
Ever since I was a kid,

20
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:18,276
I've wanted to design
a message

21
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:20,411
that is sent
to outer space.

22
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:23,548
A sort of hello from Earth
to whatever extraterrestrials

23
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,283
might be out there.

24
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,686
I mean, come on, to be
the author of the first thing

25
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:31,322
aliens ever heard
from our entire planet

26
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:33,658
would be a fantastic honor.

27
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:34,893
And as it turns out,

28
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,729
an opportunity to send
a message to space

29
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,565
has been given to me.

30
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,201
But it might
be a waste of time.

31
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:48,907
What if there isn't anything or
anyone out there to receive it?

32
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,176
The fact that we still have
no evidence

33
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,277
of intelligent alien life

34
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,314
despite the high probability
that such life exists,

35
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,216
is called the Fermi paradox.

36
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,784
And there are many
entertaining theories

37
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,753
that attempt to explain it.

38
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,655
One explanation
is the theory

39
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,391
that whenever two
civilizations meet,

40
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,327
destruction always results.

41
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,596
Which is why in 2015,

42
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,798
several prominent experts
wrote a letter

43
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:17,835
warning against making
any contact at all.

44
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:36,221
[Stephen Hawking]

45
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,591
Ideas like that suggest that
perhaps we should remain silent,

46
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,227
send no messages to space.

47
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,629
But Doug Vakoch
disagrees.

48
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,898
He is the president of METI,

49
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,368
an organization that,
despite all of these concerns,

50
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,770
is nonetheless
actively messaging

51
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:55,506
extraterrestrial
intelligence.

52
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,775
If I want to design a message
for life out there,

53
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,711
I should talk to him first.

54
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,616
Why isn't he afraid?

55
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,683
 I met up with Doug

56
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,452
 at the Chabot Observatory,

57
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,488
 home to the largest
 public refractor telescope

58
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,757
 in the Western United States.

59
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,425
-[Douglas] So here we are.
-[Michael] Wow.

60
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:15,593
[Douglas]
Yeah.

61
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:19,464
This was one of the prime
telescopes of a century ago.

62
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,400
This is really an antique.

63
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:25,436
[Michael] Jeez!
I've seen so many observatories

64
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:27,705
and so many big telescopes
in pictures.

65
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,607
Believe it or not, I've never
been this close to one.

66
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:31,909
[Douglas]
This is a huge instrument,

67
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,946
and yet it's balanced
too exquisitely.

68
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,315
I'm like a super person.
Oh!

69
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:38,483
[Douglas laughs]

70
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,485
It had quite a bit
of momentum there.

71
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,686
I'm scared to look.

72
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:44,455
I'm telling you, I had no idea
I would have this feeling,

73
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,557
-seeing a telescope this big.
-[Douglas] Well, it is, it is.

74
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,626
Can I handle
what I would see?

75
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:49,961
I think you can.
I think you can.

76
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:53,398
You just take a look.

77
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,632
Ah-ha.

78
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,367
-Absolutely nothing.
-[Douglas] Not tonight.

79
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:58,336
-Because of the fog.
-Because of the fog.

80
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:03,541
[Michael]
Just the fog coming in
is pretty darn cool.

81
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:04,809
 The universe has existed

82
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,211
 longer than we have,

83
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,514
 but we've only been actively
 listening for life out there

84
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,549
 for the last half century.

85
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,686
In 1960, astronomer Frank Drake
 began the search

86
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,422
 with a 85-foot radio
 telescope.

87
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,824
 He scanned for interstellar
 radio waves,

88
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:24,962
 but did not detect
 any recognizable signals.

89
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:29,434
Soon after, SETI, or Search for
 Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

90
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,436
 was formed to continue
 our search

91
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,404
 for other life
 in the universe.

 [Mission Control]
 Liftoff.

93
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:35,506
 [Michael]
 Besides just listening,

94
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:37,709
 we've also launched
 physical messages

95
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,644
 like the Golden Records
 we put aboard

96
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,747
 both Voyager spacecraft
 in 1977.

97
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:45,817
 The records were recordings
of images and sounds from Earth

98
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,087
that told a story of who we are
 as Earthlings,

99
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,423
 as well as coded instructions
 on how to play them back.

100
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:54,659
 Today, Doug and his team
 at METI

101
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,864
 are on a mission to send
 new messages to the stars.

102
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:03,067
Thank you for taking some time
to have a conversation with me.

103
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:06,371
My first question
is simply this:

104
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,439
where is everyone?

105
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,974
Are we alone?

106
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,542
I don't think so.

107
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:12,677
You know, we've been looking

108
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:13,812
for over 60 years.

109
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,514
And so that leads some people
to say we must be alone.

110
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:17,882
The reality is, though,

111
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:19,784
we have just
begun the search.

112
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:23,721
I mean, we've looked at a few
tens of thousands of stars,

113
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:28,059
and there are 400 billion stars
in our galaxy alone.

114
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,528
Billions of galaxies
in the universe.

115
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,930
So I think we just need
to keep on looking.

116
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:33,865
When you put it that way,

117
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,132
it actually isn't
that surprising, is it?

118
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:40,071
I mean, we are still discovering
species on our own planet today.

119
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,740
At METI, we switch the process,

120
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,942
and instead of just listening
for signals,

121
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:48,479
we send powerful, intentional
signals to other stars

122
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,448
in the hope of getting
a reply.

123
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,050
What do you say
to people who go, "Hold on,

124
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:56,888
"we should not be alerting any
life out there to our presence.

125
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,456
"It's just not worth the risk.

126
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:00,158
In fact, it's irresponsible."

127
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,927
I would say it is too late.

128
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,629
The horse is out of the barn.

129
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,166
We have been announcing
our presence to the universe

130
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:12,637
since the beginning of radio
and television.

131
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,605
Any civilization
that has the ability

132
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,474
to travel between the stars

133
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,543
already picked up
 I Love Lucy.

134
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,145
So maybe the aliens
have been observing us,

135
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:24,582
but they're waiting for us
to break the silence.

136
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,617
So our goal isn't
to let them know

137
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,019
we're here for the first time.

138
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,954
It's to really give
an indication

139
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,722
that we want
to make contact.

140
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:34,725
The one thing that's keeping me
from being really excited

141
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,561
and comfortable
about sending a message out

142
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,730
is that a lot of prominent
people have said, "Don't."

143
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,999
There are some group
of scientists who have said

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,601
you shouldn't be doing this.

145
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:44,669
Stephen Hawking.

146
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,938
But that's an example
of someone very prominent

147
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,640
who said you shouldn't transmit,

148
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,943
because maybe the aliens
will come to Earth.

149
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,744
To me it's notable that,
after his death,

150
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:56,080
to commemorate his life,
his family,

151
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,616
they transmitted his voice
out into space.

152
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:02,520
Anyone and everyone can
transmit to extraterrestrials.

153
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,822
So I think it's an incredible
contradiction

154
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:07,592
for people involved in SETI
to say we shouldn't transmit,

155
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,062
because the day they succeed,
everyone will be transmitting.

156
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:16,234
Okay, so how do we craft
a message for E.T.?

157
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,536
Well, it depends
what we would want to do.

158
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:21,739
I would want to know something
about that civilization.

159
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,908
And so then we try
to figure out,

160
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,711
what is it that we have
in common

161
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,112
with the extraterrestrials?

162
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:31,983
What do you think the aliens
would know that we know?

163
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,518
I always go to math.

164
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,786
So that's the natural
starting place.

165
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:39,123
But how can you communicate
the idea of numbers?

166
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:47,832
Like this.

167
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,867
[both clap]

168
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:52,203
-Hey, look, we're communicating.
-Okay, okay, great, great.

169
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,171
You could keep that up.
You could use that

170
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,173
to count up to a million.

171
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:59,277
But that doesn't capture
what it is to be human.

172
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,345
Right.

173
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,281
So you want to tell
a little bit about yourself.

174
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,818
The goal, for me, is to learn
about other civilizations

175
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,954
if, in fact,
they're out there.

176
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,822
But I think
even if they're not,

177
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:14,325
simply this process
of reflecting on what stories

178
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,694
do we want to tell
about ourselves,

179
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:19,630
how do we want to represent
ourselves to the universe,

180
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,265
forces us to look
at ourselves anew.

181
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:29,674
And I think that
can only be good.

182
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,975
One of my favorite messages

183
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,945
that humans have ever sent
for extraterrestrials

184
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,248
to some day receive
was written in 1974

185
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,783
by Frank Drake
and Carl Sagan.

186
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:44,589
They sent the message to a star
cluster 25,000 light years away.

187
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:50,094
It contained 1,679
binary digits

188
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,163
that, when decoded,

189
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,931
created an image:

190
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:57,168
the famous Arecibo message.

191
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,771
This message is full of general
information about us.

192
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:03,240
Up here in the white
are numbers.

193
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,743
Now, since math is probably
pretty universal,

194
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,111
I feel like it's fair to say

195
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:09,246
that aliens will understand
that part.

196
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,382
But what about some of these
other parts?

197
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:14,051
This is a human figure,
but will aliens be able to tell

198
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,219
that that is supposed to be

199
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,755
the shape of the thing
that made this?

200
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:21,225
Could an alien figure out
what all these symbols mean?

201
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:24,261
For that matter, could a human
even correctly figure out

202
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:25,696
what they all mean?

203
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,765
And I bet that if you were
to ask two people

204
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,034
to guess what all this means,

205
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:32,236
you would get
two different answers.

206
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,739
I want to give some humans
a message,

207
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,308
and I want to see how quickly
they come up with meanings

208
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:40,277
I didn't put in there,
or conflicting interpretations,

209
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,512
because if that happens,

210
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:45,149
well it could spell trouble
for our ability to say much more

211
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:51,288
than simple mathematical truths
to whatever might be out there.

212
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,224
 To help me answer
 this question,

213
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,426
 I recruited Dr. Steve Vance.

214
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,828
 Dr. Vance leads
 a habitability team

215
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,964
 for JPL's Astrobiology group,

216
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:03,000
 meaning it's his job to think
 about the possibility

217
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,002
 of life on other planets.

218
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,871
I don't think it's crazy

219
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,408
that if the Arecibo message
is received,

220
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,910
the alien civilization
that gets it

221
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,846
will see all kinds
of meanings in it.

222
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,148
They're going to see things
through the lens

223
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,817
of how they experience
their world.

224
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,053
And I think if we received
a message from outer space,

225
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,954
we would think of the ones
we've sent out,

226
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,456
and we would look
for these pieces in it.

227
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:29,960
And maybe the message
contains none of those things.

228
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:32,163
I'm really curious
about this hypothesis

229
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,099
that they will find meaning
where there isn't any.

230
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,834
There's only
one way to find out.

231
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:43,908
-Yeah. Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

232
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,444
[Michael] To find out how
 individuals' own backgrounds

233
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,380
 would influence their approach
 to a message from space,

234
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,749
 we sought out
 a veritable A-team

235
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,918
 of critical thinkers
 and problem solvers

236
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,086
 to put to the test.

237
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,755
I'm a sophomore engineer,
and I have a PhD in physics.

238
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,190
I'm a game designer
and programmer.

239
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,491
I am a professional
poker player.

240
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,460
I'm a graphic artist
and app coder.

241
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,763
I teach college courses
in writing film and psychology.

242
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,231
 This set of experts
 would be told

243
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,766
 that the message
 they were receiving

244
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,501
 was intercepted
 from outer space,

245
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:12,770
 and would be asked
 to decode it

246
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:14,505
 using a variety
 of office supplies

247
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,140
 and computer software.

248
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,875
 What they didn't know is that

249
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:20,511
 although similar to
 the original Arecibo message,

250
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,247
 our message is just noise.

251
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,149
 Would our group
 of experts notice

252
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,984
 that there was nothing
 to get,

253
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:30,955
 or apply their own meanings
to this indecipherable message?

254
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,492
 It was time to find out.

255
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,026
We received a message

256
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:39,263
using a radio telescope
from outer space.

257
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:42,299
Not the kind of thing
that naturally happens.

258
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,904
What we want to know
is what it says.

259
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:50,975
A copy of the message
as received is on that laptop.

260
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,178
This is an audio output
of that message.

261
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,281
Using your individual expertise

262
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,884
and the tools
that you have in front of you,

263
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,454
please figure out
what this message is saying.

264
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,223
This is not an easy task.

265
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:08,793
-Okay.
-Good luck.

266
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:12,563
-Okay, you ready to listen?
-Let's hear it.

267
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:13,497
Here we go.

268
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:18,803
[pings]

269
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:19,871
 Before the team
 can interpret

270
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,473
 that our jumbled image
 is meaningless,

271
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,441
 they first have to figure out
 that they're supposed

272
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,443
 to decipher it visually.

273
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:29,213
 This would be the first step
 for any alien civilization

274
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:32,817
 who received the real
 Arecibo message.

275
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,519
 To do that, the first step
 is to recognize

276
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,221
 that it's binary.

277
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:40,124
 There are two different tones
 in the message.

278
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,460
[man] Is there a difference
in time between any of these?

279
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,596
[woman]
It doesn't look like it.
The rhythm doesn't vary.

280
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:46,831
[man]
It doesn't vary?

281
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:50,434
There's going to be a repeating
pattern in there, probably.

282
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:51,669
It seems like
there's only two notes.

283
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,440
Yeah, it doesn't seem to go
any higher or lower than that.

284
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,242
So there's only two tones.
We're thinking some kind

285
00:12:58,243 --> 00:12:59,844
of binary message,
zeros and ones,

286
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,112
We should probably
start transcribing it

287
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:03,080
 and look for repeating
 patterns.

288
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,448
Right off the bat,
all right?

289
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,051
They're noticing two tones,
binary message.

290
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,019
I think that's a very
human thing to do,

291
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,322
because we already
come to this

292
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,592
knowing that binary is this
great way to talk, right?

293
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,562
So we're already seeing into it
what we expect to see.

294
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:22,900
Okay, so, we have a way
to encode binary into letters.

295
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:24,635
So if an alien intelligence
is sending things,

296
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,836
we obviously wouldn't know that,

297
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:28,138
-and it wouldn't be
the same language anyway.
-Right.

298
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,307
So they're probably just sending
us straight numbers.

299
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:33,244
Like, there's, you know,
universal language and all that.

300
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,478
So we got to find out
what those numbers are.

301
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,880
Okay, let's have
three people do this,

302
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,615
just so we make sure
we don't miss anything.

303
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,884
Let's do zero for low,
one for high,

304
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,151
and let's start
writing it down.

305
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,921
[woman]
Zero, one, zero, zero, zero...

306
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:48,993
Now they are creating
a visual representation

307
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,527
of these different tones.

308
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:54,231
The key is to see how many tones
there are.

309
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,367
-Zero, zero--
-Oh, wait, sorry. I got it.

310
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,335
[pinging]

311
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,803
[woman]
Do we need to play it in half
time

312
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,038
-because I feel like
we're scrambling.
-Yeah, we're just scrambling.

313
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:01,973
[man]
No worries, no worries.

314
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,174
[Michael]
The message is 17 minutes long,

315
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:08,178
 with 1,679 individual tones.

316
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,447
Because this would take so long
 to transcribe,

317
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:13,350
 I decided to help them
 speed up the process.

318
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:18,055
This thumb drive contains
a transcription of the message,

319
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,690
pretty much just like
what you're doing right now.

320
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:23,327
-But now you're just kind of
jumped ahead in time.
- Fast forward, yeah.

321
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,496
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

322
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,165
-All right, we will continue.
-All right, I'll leave
you guys to it.

323
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,700
[man]
Okay, this is pretty long here.

324
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,302
[woman]
It's not repeating at all.

325
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,670
Does it look like
an even distribution

326
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,138
of zeros and ones?

327
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,373
No, there's way more zeros
than ones.

328
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:37,508
-[woman] Yeah.
-[man] Okay.

329
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,945
So, what is the total
number of--?

330
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,314
[woman]
1,679 total.

331
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,684
[man]
1,679. Is that divisible
by anything in particular?

332
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,086
-It's a prime number.
-Could be a prime number.

333
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,088
It's going to be hard to test
that without writing a script.

334
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,523
Just divide, divide,
divide, divide.

335
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,024
[man]
Let's do a little division.

336
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,626
[Michael]
 Just like the Arecibo message,

337
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:58,128
 our meaningless image contains

338
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:02,266
 1,679 total tones.

339
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:06,070
 The number 1,679 can only be
 divided into two prime numbers:

340
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,571
 23 and 73.

341
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,007
 When you arrange
 the ones and zeros

342
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:13,043
 from the message
 into a 23-by-73 grid,

343
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:15,679
 the jumbled image
 will begin to emerge.

344
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,249
 If the group can discover
 this feature of 1,679,

345
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,352
 they may be able to start
 breaking down the tones

346
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,554
 of the message
 into an image.

347
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,755
Ooh. Ooh!

348
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:27,658
Hey, it's-- hey, yo,
this is important, guys.

349
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,260
This number breaks down
to 23x73.

350
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:31,362
Okay.

351
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,497
Ah-ha. There it is.

352
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:34,732
And that is
the only breakdown,

353
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,034
because 23 and 73
are prime numbers.

354
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:38,602
So that's its prime
factorization.

355
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:41,505
So that is very relevant.

356
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:45,175
Wow. Look at the big brain
on that dude.

357
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,310
[man]
 Do you think it's worth it

358
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:51,482
to try and straight up, like,
make a 23-by-73 grid,

359
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,751
and then you could
say that the lows are white

360
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,919
and the ones are black,

361
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,588
and maybe there's some kind
of image being sent there.

362
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,756
I like that idea.

363
00:15:58,757 --> 00:15:59,824
Hey.

364
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,125
[man] I'm strongly
 with the graph idea.

365
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,028
[woman]
What I'm doing right now is I'm
pasting it into Excel,

366
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,630
-and then we can graph it
in Excel and see.
-Yeah, that's good.

367
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:07,765
[Bonnie]
You mean like fill the cells

368
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,800
-Yeah.
-and make the numbers white,
and all that?

369
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,068
Yeah.

370
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:14,571
She's going to try to make this
a little easier by coloring

371
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:16,340
-all of the cells
that have a one in them.
-That's great.

372
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,809
We picked these people because
of their knowledge

373
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,677
of mathematics
and physics and music.

374
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:23,213
But their knowledge
of how to use Excel

375
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,282
is proving to be the best skill.

376
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:27,684
 Amazingly,
 in just a couple of hours,

377
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:29,520
 the team figured out
 how to break down

378
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,689
 our fake Arecibo message
 into an image.

379
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,259
 Will they try to find meaning
 in the message,

380
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,694
 or will they realize
 it's just noise?

381
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:39,163
Oh, I'm done!
Guys, I'm done!

382
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,231
-Oh, you did it.
-That was fast.

383
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:44,601
[man]
That looks sadly random.

384
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:48,405
That almost looks like it's
going to resolve into something.

385
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,808
[woman]
Maybe it's a map.

386
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,843
-Those aren't letters, are they?
-They could be.

387
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:55,412
[man]
No, they're all back half
of the alphabet, then.

388
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:56,814
Except for
little nine over here.

389
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,482
Little nine. Look at that little
nine.

390
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:01,118
-[woman] Baby nine.
-[man] That's an "I", right?

391
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,486
I'm pretty sure
there's nothing there.

392
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:03,587
There's no pattern here.

393
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:06,289
Do we agree, like, this probably
looks like nothing?

394
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,492
[woman]
Yeah, I don't think going any
further with this is really...

395
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:10,661
-Productive.
-Okay.

396
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,395
 Our group had followed
 the clues correctly

397
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:13,564
 and built out an image,

398
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,299
 even though there wasn't one
 that made sense.

399
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,836
 And, incredibly, they didn't
 try to make sense of it.

400
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,004
 Within a matter of minutes,

401
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,372
 they realized it was random
 and moved on.

402
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,808
 So it was time to let them in
 on the ruse.

403
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,343
Hello, again.

404
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:30,114
All right, so,
this is Steve Vance.

405
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,249
He's taken the day off
from JPL.

406
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,218
Have you learned anything
about the message?

407
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,352
What do you know?

408
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:38,122
It seems very random still.

409
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,690
Though it did have a nice prime
factorization.

410
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,291
That did not seem
random to me.

411
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:46,196
Let me show you guys
something new.

412
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:47,531
[man]
What the heck?

413
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,166
It looks like 23 across.

414
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,868
-I see how you're doing this.
-Oh, we were almost there!

415
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,337
We tried arranging
these ones and zeros

416
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,571
kind of in these blocks.

417
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:56,306
[woman] But there's some
patterns repeating there

418
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:59,243
that we don't actually have
mapped correctly here.

419
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,646
[Michael]
Now, this is not the message
that you're looking at.

420
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,883
This is the famous
Arecibo message.

421
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,887
Now, what you have been
working on

422
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,890
is this message,

423
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,424
but randomized.

424
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:15,726
[laughs]

425
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,894
Thanks a lot.

426
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,163
[all laugh]

427
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,698
Oh, I'm just going to collapse
on the ground now.

428
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,201
In a way, you guys were
quite successful.

429
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:25,903
You, first of all,

430
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,373
recognized the semi-prime nature
of this message very quickly,

431
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,308
and tried to build an image.

432
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:32,509
I was wondering
if you would start

433
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,245
to see things there
that weren't.

434
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:37,915
But it didn't really happen,
did it?

435
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,284
I think the real reason
that we weren't interpreting

436
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,319
anything out of that

437
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,520
is we were looking
for clearly defined patterns.

438
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,522
We're looking
for something like this.

439
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:47,357
This is actually
what we're looking for.

440
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,959
Even symmetry would have been
a big thing for me.

441
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,561
If I'd seen any symmetry
in these patterns,

442
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,462
I would have said,
"This is not random."

443
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:53,830
I'm also interested
in knowing

444
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:56,867
the best kind
of message to send,

445
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:59,636
because I have an opportunity
to send a message.

446
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,738
You know, a marker
to where we are

447
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,473
is kind of
the biggest thing for me,

448
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:05,976
but then it's like, do we really
want to tell them where we are?

449
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,678
Is that something--
Do we want them to come visit?

450
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,513
-I don't know.
-What do you guys think?

451
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:13,217
Should we be sending messages
to outer space?

452
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,384
[all]
Yeah, yes.

453
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:15,185
[Matthew]
I don't think we should.

454
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:17,254
Every single time
any civilization

455
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,489
encounters any other
civilization,

456
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,992
and one is technologically
advanced, one guy gets crushed.

457
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:24,962
You know, what if they're not
more advanced than us?

458
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,030
What if we're at the same place,

459
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,967
and the only way we can
communicate is like this?

460
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:34,504
What if we can just exchange
the recipe for fusion?

461
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:37,341
We would have so much to learn
from those people,

462
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,311
and really nothing to lose
in that situation.

463
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,212
You're making an argument

464
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,413
that we almost have
a moral imperative

465
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:46,250
to send our knowledge to share
with other civilizations.

466
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,884
-Absolutely, yes.
-It's a really interesting
point.

467
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,553
That's kind of where I land.

468
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,921
Let's just think of this
as a way

469
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,657
to preserve the stories
that we've been able to tell,

470
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:56,360
which, by the way, we tell
better than the universe does.

471
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,663
Thank you all so much.
This was a phenomenal exercise.

472
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:05,869
[all]
Thanks. Thank you.

473
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,538
You know, honestly, I thought
that the human tendency

474
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:12,943
to find meaning where there is
none would more quickly emerge.

475
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,745
But that didn't really happen.

476
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,382
What I also didn't expect
was just how educational

477
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,017
the whole challenge
would be.

478
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,620
I mean, I saw some human flaws
and biases at work,

479
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:27,658
but more generally,
I saw the human mind at work,

480
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,459
who we are.

481
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,527
Which kind of makes sense,
right?

482
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,929
I mean, the Voyager
Golden Record

483
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,400
really isn't just a neat thing
for extraterrestrials.

484
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:45,075
It's a neat archive by,
of and for us.

485
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,511
I don't think we will all
ever agree

486
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,579
about whether or not
we should be sending messages

487
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,816
to outer space
announcing that we are here.

488
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:53,684
But here's the thing.

489
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,586
Sending focused messages
to outer space

490
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:59,589
requires technology
that not all of us have.

491
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,692
So only those with access

492
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,394
can say hello to
extraterrestrials if they want.

493
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:07,497
But who chose them
to speak for us,

494
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:09,766
for all of Earth?

495
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,968
Well, I've come here,
to Vazquez Rocks State Park,

496
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,604
to talk to a man
who is changing that.

497
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:18,075
He is democratizing active SETI,
because the service he has built

498
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,378
is allowing anyone to send
any message they want

499
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,046
to outer space.

500
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,749
 He's an expert in the field
 of alien communication

501
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,884
 with a doctorate in elementary
 particle physics,

502
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:32,022
 and he's the one who's going
 to help me send my message.

503
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:35,726
Tell me about the way
you are talking to aliens

504
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,761
and helping other
people do it.

505
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:41,131
Well, I have built a website,
called SpaceSpeak.com.

506
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:44,501
And it allows people
to send a text in audio

507
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:47,637
or a image message
out into space.

508
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:52,109
My view is, as many people
that can reach out to aliens

509
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,978
or the universe in general,
the better.

510
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,781
What are you using
to transmit these messages?

511
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,851
Radio waves. Radio waves are
just another form of photon.

512
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,921
And once a photon is broadcast
into space, it persists.

513
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:07,157
It never dies.
It never decays.

514
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,793
A million years from now,
maybe the earth is gone,

515
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:11,995
maybe the solar system is gone,

516
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:14,598
but your message
is still out there,

517
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,567
and essentially become
archaeological photons

518
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:21,938
for some future generation
to see what we were about.

519
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:24,074
-I want to do this.
-Absolutely, let's do it.

520
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:27,477
-Awesome.
-Great.

521
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:28,945
Going to take a chair
right here.

522
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:31,081
-And...
-This is it.

523
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,016
This is the Space Speak
transmitter.

524
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:35,018
This is a transmitter box here.

525
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,422
And the antenna
is right back here.

526
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,023
I've been thinking
about this a lot,

527
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,591
and I've spoken
to a lot of people

528
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:46,830
about what to send,
how to write the message,

529
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,698
and whether or not
I should send anything at all.

530
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:51,101
I don't think this is something
to take as fact.

531
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:53,437
It's my personal opinion.

532
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,740
I don't have any fear
that this is dangerous.

533
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:58,909
-Yeah.
-I spent a lot of time

534
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,177
constructing what I believe

535
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,713
to be a really neat,
clever idea.

536
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:05,916
I was going to not send
a two-dimensional image

537
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:06,951
like the Arecibo,

538
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,219
but a three-dimensional image
made of voxels.

539
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,854
And I got really into this.

540
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:15,025
And then after talking to you
and really thinking about

541
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:20,030
the point of communicating
with outer space,

542
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,898
beyond Earth,

543
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:24,601
I...I just think

544
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:28,505
to decide what to say
and how to say it.

545
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:32,175
is an exercise in learning
how we communicate at all.

546
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:34,177
-Yes.
-It's always coming back

547
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,580
to who we are.

548
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,949
My grandmother passed away
a few days ago.

549
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,617
I'm so sorry
to hear that.

550
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:43,253
I'm actually leaving tomorrow
to her funeral,

551
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:46,089
and I'll get to see
all of my family.

552
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,159
And obviously I'm never going
to forget my grandma.

553
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,662
And the way she, you know,
made me who I am,

554
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:56,099
that will, in a way, like echo
like ripples in a pond, right?

555
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,834
For generations to come.

556
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:02,239
But this is a message
made of light

557
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,777
that will be around forever...

558
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:10,247
until the universe ends,
somehow.

559
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,215
So I have the last photograph

560
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:14,251
that was ever taken
of us together.

561
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,987
I'd like to send
that picture out.

562
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:22,726
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

563
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,828
This photo is her
in the hospital,

564
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:27,898
using one of those, like,
grabber tools, you know,

565
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,267
to pull my beard hairs
and hurt me.

566
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,202
[laughs]

567
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,170
And she was so weak,
but with that tool,

568
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:35,572
she could pinch.

569
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:36,940
-Oh, that's awesome.
-It's a great picture

570
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:39,276
of who we were.

571
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,312
She wasn't a big fan of aliens

572
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:43,813
as far as I know,

573
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:46,650
but it's us
caught in this moment

574
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,618
that I think I want
to remember,

575
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:50,320
and I want the universe
to remember.

576
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:53,056
So...

577
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:53,724
well, let's do it.

578
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,294
Yeah. Go ahead and hit "send."

579
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,829
Wow. It's sent.
And look at that.

580
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,834
-It's already 229,435 miles
away from Earth.
-Yes.

581
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:07,237
I don't think she ever traveled
that far in her entire life.

582
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:09,172
-Now she has.
-She has now, absolutely.

583
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:11,975
[Michael]
And she will continue traveling.

584
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:15,245
Your grandmother
will touch the universe. Yeah.

585
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:16,680
Peter, thank you
very much.

586
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:22,052
You are very welcome, sir.
It was a pleasure.

587
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,787
[Michael]
 And, as always,

588
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:35,065
 thanks for watching.
