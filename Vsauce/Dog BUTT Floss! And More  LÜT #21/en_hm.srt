1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,789
A wallet that looks like a matchbook and edible
spray paint.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:09,819
It's episode 21 of LÜT.
The mince that come in this spam tin actually

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,909
taste like cinnamon, but this lip balm tastes
like Lucky Charms.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,049
Question.
What's warmer than a sweater and a mug of

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,948
hot chocolate?
Answer: a mug wearing a sweater.

6
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:24,108
Keep your hands equally warm with predator
and pray mittens.

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:28,548
One hand's a cat, the other's a dog.
One's a frog, one's fly.

8
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:32,347
One's an owl and other is a mouse.
Or, use Tatchies.

9
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,468
They let you get touchy with your touchscreen
without removing your gloves.

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:41,159
Of course, all of these gloves will cover
up your awesome ring with the stone set upside

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,379
down, making it a "Killer Ring."
Or this ring with a hidden diamond.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,398
Generate also has synthetic leather bags that
look like envelopes, wing rings and shirts

13
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,919
with special stripes you can wipe your glasses
with.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,358
But let's talk about moulds that make your
cookies into moustaches.

15
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,459
Or, these cupcake pillows.
A giant ice cream sandwich pillow is also

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,548
fun and barbed wire toilet paper is mainly
just scary.

17
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,399
Kisses are better, but hey, this bath towel
makes it look like you're wearing a kilt.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,019
So let's talk high fashion and cover funny hats.

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,459
Stupid.com also offers this tiny peace sign
hat for your little dog, and of course a hat

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,069
that looks like underwear.
Does this guy even know that his hat is funny?

21
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,269
I also like their hands waving USA flags hat.
Keep things patriotic with these flag pants.

22
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,048
Betabrand also carries these dress pants that
are actually sweatpants.

23
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,989
Now, if you've mainly made history wearing
shirts, use Urban Outfitters' t-shirt frames

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,089
to preserve those memories.
Or design your own on this t-shirt design

25
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,048
notepad.
Also a good option - this note-pad.

26
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:54,808
Then toast your good taste with some bacon-flavored
soda, perfect for washing down a giant burrito.

27
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,348
Just kidding.
It's a protective wrap for valuable camera

28
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:00,699
lenses.
Improve your view with Generate's skyline

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,209
blinds and improve your bathroom with this
real aquarium sink - a perfect companion to

30
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,249
the iPoop toilet.
Your iPhone will be fine if you drop it in,

31
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,499
because you've waterproofed it with Liquipel.
Or, you're busy looking like an executive

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,829
with the iPhone handset converter.
Now these puzzles are shaped like donuts,

33
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,709
pizza or coffee, but the world record holding
largest puzzle can be yours.

34
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:29,009
It has more than 32,000 pieces and weighs
over 37 pounds.

35
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,769
For a more dare devilish challenge, play Russian
Roulette with water balloons.

36
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,609
You never when the gun will pierce the balloon.
But for a sweeter challenge, Bite The Bullet

37
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,199
gives you a dozen delicious chocolates shaped
like bullets, except one contains a hidden

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,259
dangerously hot pepper.
Good luck.

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,759
If your sweet tooth also likes blink, pick
up some twinkles.

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,519
Dental jewellery made with a special adhesive
that only lets go when you want to remove

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,229
it.
Clean the rest of your teeth with some floss

42
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,309
you pulled out of a dog's butt and clean your
body with tetromino shaped soap, behind your

43
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,199
Facebook-styled shower curtain.
Then, decorate your hair with these comic-inspired

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,919
headbands and show it all off in front of
the paparazzi that you hired.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,579
For an hour, at $100 a photographer, this
company will send paparazzi to harass you

46
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,359
and make you look famous no matter who you are.

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,399
If you get a boo-boo during the whole process,
be sure you're caught wearing a brandage.

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,699
Question.
Can you identify which characters these eyes

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,439
belong to?
Well, they're sonic.

50
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,339
You can play on the site or you can grab the
picture as an art print.

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,759
Speaking of posters, here's a map of the world
made with what makes it go round.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,199
Moustaches.
And here's a fictional map made out of places

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,639
made famous in songs.
Just take the "Highway to Hell" after "Heartbreak

54
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,539
Hotel" and picnic in "Itchycoo Park."
This artist on Etsy will make an incredible

55
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,209
custom stamp that actually looks just like you.

56
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,409
Now, separate salt and pepper shakers are
fine, but Fred makes this Switch - pick what

57
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,009
you want and shake.
Your earbuds can be superheroes and your ears

58
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,129
can also delight in wearing some handmade
Calvin and Hobbes earrings.

59
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,399
If Hobbes means something more philosophical
to you, pick up a Hobbes mug.

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,979
Now, how about a free thing?
Try Night Soil.

61
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,648
This is the word for human poop that you steal
from outhouses and the trains and cesspools

62
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,949
at night in order to use us as free fertiliser
on your crops.

63
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,909
It's a bad idea.
Don't do it.

64
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,319
Compose that stuff first, come on.
But seriously, here are some great iPhone

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,029
backgrounds that you can get for free from
a great LÜT site.

66
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,779
A Rhombicuboctahedron has 26 faces, which
is also the number of years old I'm turning

67
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,359
today.
That's right.

68
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,739
It's my birthday and you're all invited to
the party.

69
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,699
Consider the comment section the party...

70
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,779
And as always,

71
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,820
thanks for watching.
