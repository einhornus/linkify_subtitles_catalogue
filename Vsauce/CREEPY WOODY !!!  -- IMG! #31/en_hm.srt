00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,469
Creepy woody and this place is great for kids.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:09,479
Wait...
It's episode 31 of IMG!

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,268
Parents are

4
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,149
awesome, except when they play favorites.
And here's Bert

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,108
in real life. There won't be any cats in this
episode, but there will be zombie

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,598
jean shorts rigor mortis girls and
plenty of dogs.

7
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:25,108
"Ugh, are we gonna go yet?"
"Hi-five!" "Ice,

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,598
hahaha, it makes me happy."
Oh and the thing I said about no cats -

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,328
- not true. Here is one you can buy at a grocery
store. But let's move on to insects,

10
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,549
dead ones. Magnus Muhr symbols dead
flies into poses,

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,419
draws limbs and props and takes a
picture. Hey, this one got to me to moth.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,749
Some people earn their swag and some
people

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,448
are born with it.
Got a problem, player? Best

14
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:52,808
party ever. You gotta peel 'em all.
Well, seriously, let's peel 'em

15
00:00:52,809 --> 00:01:05,639
and enjoy some banana art.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,339
Not enough?

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,239
Well, reddit provided the ultimate. Reddit
also showed off this colorized photo of

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,779
Abraham Lincoln from the White House Museum.
He looks kinda weird, right?

19
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,899
Well experts say that his odd face
may have been caused

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,059
by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b.

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,239
Let's get chart-y. This is the famous Venn diagram showing the relationships

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,159
between mythical creatures.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,219
But more importantly, nerdy weddings.

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,499
They're gory, lightsaber-y and super sweet...

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,969
crotch.
Phil Noto is an artist whose work I love.

26
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,978
Superhero tensions.
Jon Hamm

27
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,629
as Superman and battleship shoes.
Whenever I see shoes like that I'm like,

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,029
hey,

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,129
nice shoes, and then girls were all like
thanks, they're vans; awesome!

30
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,889
delivered my

31
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,758
favorite - ambigram.
This word spells black one-way

32
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,089
and upside down it spells white. Now, I've shown you rotating snakes before - the image

33
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,559
that moves when you look at it.

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,639
I mean, seriously, look around the image, pause the video,

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,079
it'll creep you out. But this one's new to
me and it's really neat. Look at the

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,939
different letters

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,269
and as you look around it will seem to
grow and move. But now, a bunch of punching

38
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,669
bags hung all over the place,

39
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,489
except from one angle they're Muhammad Ali.
Wilson Hennessy

40
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,079
blows my mind.
A cigarette that almost disappears,

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,489
a painted paint can that almost disappears and

42
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,509
how is this possible?
Finally,

43
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,579
Sarah Dayo has been creating what
look like half-open

44
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,009
doorways with an oddly shaped mirror.
GIF break.

45
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,459
Toast like a boss.

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,689
Still want more? Well, you're in luck. We
almost have five thousand pictures submitted

47
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,699
by people like you

48
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,759
on Facebook.com/VsauceGaming, including

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,109
Muhammad's nervous banana and Kelly's screenshot from

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,889
Vsauce Leanback. Wow, be careful,
don't look directly into his eyes.

51
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,249
Oh, and remember creepy Woody? Well to find out where that's from and how you

52
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,089
can get your own,

53
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,529
check out today's new episode of LÃœT right
here. It's just like this show, except you

54
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,249
can buy everything I mention.

55
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,809
And hey, as always,

56
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,090
thanks for watching.
