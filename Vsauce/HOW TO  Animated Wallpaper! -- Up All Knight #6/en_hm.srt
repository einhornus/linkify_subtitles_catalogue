Vsauce. Michael here with a new
episode of "Up All Knight."

00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,099
Vsauce.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,888
Michael here today with a new episode
of "Up All Knight," a show where I cover cool, geeky

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:15,629
trick things.
For instance, we all know Yahoo.com,

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,469
but do you know what happens when you click
on the dot in the exclamation point

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,759
after "Yahoo!" ?

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,359
"YAHOOOOO!"

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,649
Next, let's talk video.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,788
VLC is a free media player that
lets you do some cool

10
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,858
things.
Open up VLC, go to Preferences,

11
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,449
Video, select all, click on Video,

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,839
Output modules and choose color ASCII art

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,648
video output.
Now, my episode of Bill Nye is made out of

14
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,349
text.
I can also make my wallpaper my desktop wallpaper

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,538
animated and move.
Go to preferences, video,

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,049
all, and under an output module you'll find
"Use as desktop background." Ta-da!

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,229
Now I can work right on top of Bill.
For my final trick,

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,889
let's download some YouTube videos.
Just copy your YouTube URL

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,978
and open it as "network."
Then go to window, media information,

20
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:09,099
and boom!
That is its secret location.

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,499
Depending on your browser it will either
take you to a full-screen version that

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,289
you could download

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,769
or immediately start downloading the
video at full quality.

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,109
Google can be a lot like old-school
Napster. Use code number one in this video's

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,169
description to search for downloadable

26
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,669
audio files. Just put the keyword you
want between the double quotes

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,789
and sweet, look what I found.
Not big enough?

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,868
Well, try to add "admir7656's" recommendation of

29
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:36,709
epic Google. It just keeps growing and
growing and growing

30
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,879
until you search.
You can also try Weenie Google.

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,379
It shrinks and shrinks so fast.
Mac users,

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,539
did you know that the application icon
for Text Edit has a message

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,868
on it that you can read if you zoom in
enough? And Windows users,

34
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,078
paste code number two in the notepad,
save it as a ".bat" file,

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,118
open it and play tic-tac-toe.
If you have not yet seen

36
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,419
every episode of "Up All Knight,"
make today the day you do it.

37
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,489
You can click any of these to watch previous
episodes,to learn stuff like how to

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,648
reveal passwords

39
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:09,779
and a couple, well, way more than a couple, pranks.

40
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,559
Subscribe to Vsauce for more and get
excited for Saturday,
