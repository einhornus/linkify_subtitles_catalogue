00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,949
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
In 2003, researchers did the measurements

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:13,758
and found that Kansas is in fact literally
flatter than a pancake.

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,089
Of course, the Earth is not flat, the Earth
is round.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,769
Otherwise travellers would be falling off
the edge all the time.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,599
Right?

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,909
Wrong.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,858
If the Earth was not a ball shaped, but was
instead a flat disk, like this plate, well

8
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,499
with the weight, density and thickness, living
in the middle could feel pretty normal.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,439
But as you move toward the edge, gravity on a disk Earth would slightly skew, pushing

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,179
at a greater and greater angle back toward the centre.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,299
My friend Nick from 'yeti dynamics' put together
this great simulation.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,939
The person and buildings obviously aren't
to scale but check out how such increasingly

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,479
diagonal gravity would work.
Although this is a flat disk, it would feel

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,999
to a runner headed toward the edge, like they were fighting to climb up a steeper and steeper

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,859
hill.

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,719
The building foundations behind the runner

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,539
reflect how you would have to build structures, closer and closer to the edge, so that people

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,959
living in them always felt like down was at
right angles to the floor - the way we feel

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,119
it on our big, round Earth.
As you approach the edge, things would get

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,199
scary.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,709
Remember, this is a flat Earth, but it would

22
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,949
feel like a sheer drop off.

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,049
What's really cool is that contrary to the

24
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,649
"don't fall off the edge" fear, on a flat
world because of gravity, the scary risk would

25
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,169
actually be falling away from the edge and
rolling all the way back to the centre.

26
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,639
Once you stepped over the edge, instead of
falling off into space, you'd be able to relax.

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,479
It would be a nice level place.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,099
This model, of course, neglects the fact that such

29
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,739
a planet shape would be impossible.

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,689
Anything as massive as the Earth, shaped like

31
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,269
a flat disc, would, under its own gravity,
naturally collapse back into a ball.

32
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:13,878
This is why in outer space everything more
than few hundred miles in diameter is round.

33
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,908
Or so we've been told.
What if gravity isn't real?

34
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:23,869
What if the Earth is, in fact, flat and science
has been wrong all along?

35
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,149
It's a misconception that Christopher Columbus
discovered that the Earth is round.

36
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,438
Virtually every scholar and major religion
in the West accepted Earth's rotundity, since

37
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,958
at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, who,
for instance, had noticed that boats disappear

38
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,429
bottom first when sailing away.
And, as you walk north and south, stars pop

39
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,539
in and out of the view.

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,608
The misconception that only a few hundred

41
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:55,718
years ago lots and lots of people believed
the Earth was flat likely began in the modern

42
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,778
era, as a sort of insult.
Well, your people recently thought the Earth

43
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:06,298
was flat, so why should we believe you now?
The smear was repeated and published so often

44
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:13,578
it became accepted as historical fact.
"Flat-Earther" became synonymous with "Anti-science".

45
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:18,858
It might seem flat over short distances, but
over longer ones, well the Earth is pretty

46
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,339
darn curvy.

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,509
The Verrazanoâ€“Narrows Bridge, connecting

48
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,729
Staten Island and Brooklyn, had to be designed
with Earth's roundness in mind.

49
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:35,328
Its 2 towers, separated by 1300 metres, and
perfectly vertical, are nonetheless 41 milimetres

50
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:39,308
further apart at the top than at the bottom

51
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:41,308
because of Earth's curvature.

52
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:47,238
In the 3rd century BC, Eratosthenes measured
the differences between shadows cast by poles

53
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:54,548
in Syene and Alexandria to calculate, more
than 2000 years before rockets and space travel,

54
00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:01,869
the circumference of the entire globular Earth,
with, for the time, impressive accuracy.

55
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,778
Word got around that the Earth was a round
shape after that.

56
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:14,708
But in 1906, Wilbur Glenn Voliva became head
of a slightly bizarre religious sect that

57
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,487
pretty much ran the city of Zion, Illinois.

58
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:21,278
Voliva believed that the Earth was actually

59
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,019
flat and he enforced flat Earth's teachings
in schools in Zion.

60
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,149
He also enforced that belief on really anyone
who entered the city.

61
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,929
Voliva believed not only that the Earth was
flat, but that the sun was only few thousand

62
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,369
miles away from Earth.
Not 93 million.

63
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,429
He also believed that the sun was only 32
miles across, not 860 000.

64
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,668
He sounds crazy, or does he?
You see, the same phenomenon Eratosthenes

65
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,508
measured could be explained by a flat Earth,
if the sun were only few thousand miles away

66
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:04,469
and 32 miles across - the math would work
out the same.

67
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,679
Today, with the power of the Internet, modern
day flat Earthers have picked up where Voliva

68
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,839
left off.

69
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,579
They have quite good explanations for any

70
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,109
evidence you throw at them that the Earth is round.

71
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,888
Circumnavigation is really just a flat circle path.

72
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,739
The round shadow Earth casts on the Moon during
a lunar eclipse could also be made by a flat

73
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,019
disc.
Time zones are caused by spotlight sun, and

74
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,469
remember how gravity would be totally different
on a disc-shaped planet?

75
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,079
Well, they argue that gravity, as we know
it, simply doesn't exist.

76
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,938
The flat disc of Earth is merely accelerating
up at 9.8 metres per second.

77
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,619
As for all of the photos and video evidence
we now have that the Earth is round, thanks

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,109
to space exploration, well all of that material
is completely fabricated.

79
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:02,348
A hoax, perpetrated by Big Globe.
Space agencies, airlines, globe manufacturers.

80
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:07,529
They are reaping the rewards of our ignorant
belief that the Earth is actually round.

81
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,468
They know, of course, that it's flat.
And they're hiding that truth from us.

82
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:17,468
Is it merely a coincidence that the logo used
by the Flat Earth Society is a projection

83
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:22,568
of Earth, centred on the North Pole, and also
happens to be the projection used by the United

84
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,539
Nations?

85
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,539
Are these people for real?

86
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,499
Probably not most of them.
But this is the crocks of Poe's Law.

87
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:39,309
An adage that states that at their extremes,
parody of extremism and sincere extremism

88
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,719
are difficult to distinguish.

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,269
Although clever, flat Earth theories are predominantly

90
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,959
ad hoc explanations - excuses made up on the
spot that only address one issue and don't

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,879
fit all the evidence.

92
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,748
Science, of course, rejects a theory if a

93
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:01,879
better one fits more of our observations,
but why the egoistical obsession with OUR

94
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,579
observations?

95
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,138
A cosmic ray particle could use the very same

96
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:12,579
scientific method we use and conclude that
the Earth was, in fact, flat.

97
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,408
You see, at speeds near the speeds of light,
time slows down and lengths contract.

98
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,638
One way we know this is that unstable muons,
created in the upper atmosphere by the collision

99
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,348
of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, should
mostly decay before reaching Earth's surface.

100
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:35,318
But yet, we detect a lot of them down here,
because they're crazy fast speed literally

101
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,429
means that, from our perspective, their physics
runs according to a slower clock; and to them,

102
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:47,228
the distance they have to cover to the surface
during their short lives is, from their perspective,

103
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:53,179
much much shorter than it appears to us.
If you're a cosmic ray proton travelling at

104
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:03,778
99.9999999999991% the speed of light, Earth
would appear to be only 17 metres thick in

105
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,638
the direction you travel.

106
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,199
So Earth is flat to them, but round to us.

107
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,359
It is ball shaped to some observers and flat to others.

108
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,668
There doesn't appear to be a single most correct-est,
in all circumstances, answer.

109
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,568
Susan Haack compares knowledge to a crossword puzzle.

110
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:30,619
New answers interweave with old ones, they
all reinforce one another.

111
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,639
The clues are the questions we ask, and the
way the answers fall into a predetermined

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,699
grid, well, that's our confidence that we're
on the right track.

113
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,189
But that doesn't mean one day there will be
a finished puzzle - a complete answer.

114
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,599
Recall The New York Times famous 1996 crossword
puzzle that came out the day before the US

115
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,639
election between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole.
The clue for 39 across was pretty crazy.

116
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,219
You seemed to need to be able to tell the
future to answer it correctly.

117
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,199
It simply said,

118
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,859
"Lead story in tomorrow's newspaper

119
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,029
(blank) elected".

120
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,749
Well that blank could be Clinton or Bob Dole
and who's to say which one until tomorrow?

121
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,339
There's no way to know.
But, as it turned out, the answer was Clinton,

122
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,379
or Bob Dole.
No matter which you wrote in, all the other

123
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,089
clues fit.
For instance, a "black Halloween animal" could

124
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,309
either be a cat or a bat.

125
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,099
Our knowledge about the outside world might

126
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,419
be the same.

127
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,409
A puzzle with no answer key, just the reassurance

128
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,829
that the answers we think we know fit together,
so they're probably correct.

129
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,449
Though there's always the possibility that
the answer to one clue, or all of them, will

130
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,249
fundamentally not have a single definite satisfying answer.

131
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,049
The puzzle may be playable forever.

132
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,179
I like what Richard Feynman says about this.

133
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,069
"Some people say 'How can you live without
knowing?' I do not know what they mean. I

134
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,599
always live without knowing - that is easy.
How you get to know is what I want to know."

135
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,719
You know?

136
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,759
And as always,

137
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
thanks for watching.
