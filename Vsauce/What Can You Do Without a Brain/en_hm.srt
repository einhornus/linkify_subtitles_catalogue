Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:07,259
And subscribing to Vsauce is a no-brainer, or is it?

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,129
I mean,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,749
you would need your brain to understand the
words that I was speaking, and you would need

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,309
your brain to decide whether or not you liked
what you were hearing. You would also need

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,979
your brain to move your muscles in just the
right way to click the subscribe button.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,929
In fact, you need your brain to do a lot of stuff and without a brain, well, you can't do much

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:37,879
of anything at all. So, literally speaking,
is there really such a thing as a "no-brainer?"

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,919
Let's begin with no-header's...decapitation.
It's a macabre subject, I know, but what's

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:54,539
the matter? Are you chicken? Ok, good.
Because Mike certainly was. In 1945, farmer Lloyd

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:01,099
Olsen went out to grab a chicken for supper.
He cut the chicken's head off and it didn't

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:08,339
die. Mike The Headless Chicken lived for another
18 months. He toured the country and surprised

13
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,889
onlookers. He could walk and perch and was
fed by putting little drops of water or pieces

14
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,158
of grain down his throat. But here's the thing.
Mike The Headless Chicken's actions

15
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,868
weren't a no-brainer, because even though
he didn't have much of what we would call

16
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,028
a "head" left,
he did have a bit of his brain stem.

17
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:34,768
If we want a clearer no-brainer, we're going
to have to look at an even more simple creature,

18
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,748
the cockroach. These guys don't even breath
through their heads so, without one, they're

19
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:44,748
fine. Instead, they breath through holes all
over their bodies. And instead of being controlled

20
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:49,848
by a big, massive brain, they have little
bundles of nerves, ganglia, throughout their

21
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:56,608
body, and so, even without any head parts,
even when completely decapitated, a cockroach

22
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:03,828
can live for weeks. It can walk around, respond
to movement. Really its only problem is that

23
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:08,179
without its head it will eventually starve to death.

24
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:15,579
Us humans are not nearly as fortunate. Without
a head and brain we die within seconds, if

25
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,318
not instantly. But before you get jealous,
keep in mind that with our heads intact, we

26
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:29,568
are capable of some actions that don't necessarily
require the brain: reflexes. When you snap

27
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:36,808
your finger, your finger moves at about 20
mph. And a really big sneeze can expel air

28
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:47,739
at nearly 30-40 mph. But nerve impulses, they're
really quick. They can clock in at 250 mph,

29
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,999
but sometimes, that's not even fast enough.
For instance, if you accidentally put your

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,159
hand on a hot stove, cells are dying quickly.
And 250 mph doesn't cut it, you need to take

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,419
an action fast. It's not worth it to tell
your brain what's happening right away. And

32
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:11,219
so instead, your immediate reaction to pull
away is mediated by other parts of your nervous

33
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:20,719
system. The same can be said for involuntary
and unconscious processes.

34
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,959
So, in a way, these unconscious, involuntary,
or reflexive behaviors could be considered

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:33,238
no-brainers. But I'm not quite satisfied
yet because they still require that your brain

36
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:41,759
be there, keeping you alive. So, what if you
weren't alive? Well, in your dead, brainless

37
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,839
body, your muscle cells still contain a little
bit of energy in the form of ATP.

38
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,559
Backyard Brains, right here on YouTube, demonstrates
this with insect parts. This leg is no longer

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,408
connected to a brain or a body, but energy
remains in the cells. And so, researchers

40
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:08,279
can detect electrical signals when the leg
is touched or even simply breathed on.

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,519
"Whoa, that popping sound you're hearing is
the spontaneous discharge rate of the living

42
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,679
neurons in the still-living leg."

43
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,528
The muscle cells of a human limb would respond
in just the same way. But you don't need wires

44
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:28,529
to observe behavior like this. Salt can also
do the trick. The introduction of sodium ions

45
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,779
can cause a process similar to an action-potential
in a living animal. Salt added to these fresh

46
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,779
frog legs makes them dance, though not for
very long. The cells will eventually run out

47
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:49,039
of energy or simply decay. But to be sure,
there are many other brief candidates for

48
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,619
no-brainers at the moment of death. For instance,
muscles relaxing, causing a person to

49
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,419
soil themselves. Technically, a no-brainer. But
it's a misconception that a corpse continues

50
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,919
to grow fingernails and hair. Instead, it's
actually the skin itself shrinking as it

51
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,799
dries, making hair and nails appear longer.

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,159
But let's take a closer look at these skin cells,
because we might be on to a quite satisfactory

53
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,969
no-brainer. Your skin cells live on the periphery
of your body and they don't require a constant

54
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,329
stream of new nutrients from your blood.
And so even though you are dead and your brain

55
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,749
is no longer calling the shots, your skin
cells can continue to live, gathering nutrients

56
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:44,129
through osmosis and dividing for days.
In fact, you can harvest skin cells from a corpse

57
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,779
after 24 hours.

58
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:53,409
On a related note - digestion.
Sure, a lot of the digestive process is completed by you

59
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:00,339
being alive and having a nervous system that
works. But part of the work is done by bacteria

60
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,019
that just happens to live inside your gut.
And when you're dead or your brain is gone,

61
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:14,699
they'll continue digesting.
So, in a way, making poop, at least part of that process,

62
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,639
is a no-brainer.

63
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,459
But here's the thing. These bacteria that
live inside you are foreign bacteria.

64
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,979
Are they you?

65
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,479
For that matter, what about the
skin cells that can continue to live after you're dead?

66
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,879
Are they you or are they merely cells
that you have made a good home for?

67
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,439
We're getting pretty philosophical here because
we're basically asking if you are merely your

68
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,809
brain and everything else that goes on when
you no longer have one is just other stuff

69
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,519
that you aren't doing?

70
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,619
You could argue that without a brain your body
no longer has your intentions. It no longer

71
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:07,499
does things because you have decided to do them.
In other words, a no-brainer may be

72
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:15,359
impossible for you to do,
because it requires not using you.

73
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,619
If you are merely what your brain does and
not what your cells do off on their own when

74
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:32,779
the brain is gone then, in a way, being you,
being alive, is a yes-brainer.

75
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:39,039
Another great yes-brainer is checking out Vsauce3.
You can find some scientific video

76
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,959
game analysis, some gamer LÃœT and some pretty
cool apps to download. Go check that out.

77
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,759
And as always,

78
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,280
thanks for watching.
