1
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:15,680
[clangs]

2
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,749
This is Inuyama, Japan,

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,517
a historic city

4
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,520
home to Japan's oldest
original wooden castle.

5
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:25,557
It is also home
to Kyoto University's

6
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:32,831
Primate Research Institute.

7
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,500
 Here, a group of chimpanzees
 have been trained

8
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:39,537
 to play a game that exposes
 something shocking

9
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:41,306
 about their memories.

10
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,707
 This is going
 to blow your mind.

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,242
 Here is how it works.

12
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:46,444
 Take a look at these numbers.

13
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:48,246
 1, 2, 3.

14
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:49,781
 Remember where they are,

15
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:52,851
 because they're about
 to disappear.

16
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,652
 Can you point to where
 each number used to be

17
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:56,354
 in numerical order?

18
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:57,822
 Probably. It's pretty easy.

19
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,324
 1, 2, 3.

20
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,392
 But what if we
 make it harder?

21
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:05,130
 Get ready to point to where
 each number was in order...

22
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,764
 now.

23
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:08,533
 If you feel like you didn't
 have enough time

24
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,468
 to memorize the screen,
 that's fine.

25
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,370
 It's nothing
 to be ashamed of.

26
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,339
 Or is it?

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,542
 Here is a chimpanzee
 taking exactly that long

28
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:20,612
 to memorize the same
 arrangement.

29
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,547
 Nailed it.

30
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,883
 Each of these puzzles
 is completely new

31
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,484
 to the chimpanzee,

32
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:28,686
 but just a glance
 is all it needs

33
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:31,789
 to completely capture
 all the numbers.

34
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,325
 How can a chimpanzee's memory

35
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:35,827
 be so much better
 than ours?

36
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:38,363
 Well, one theory
 is that we humans

37
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:57,949
 are worse at this task
 because we can talk.

38
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,452
What makes humans different
from other animals?

39
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,755
Well, one thing is language.

40
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,357
We have the cognitive ability

41
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:08,927
to communicate not just about
what's happening now,

42
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:14,232
but also about what did happen,
and what could happen.

43
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,834
We can tell stories,
and it's awesome.

44
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,904
But if language is so good,

45
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:25,443
why didn't any other animal
develop it like we did?

46
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:27,478
 A good approach
 to this question

47
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,947
 is one that looks
 at how we are different

48
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,583
 from those who were almost us.

49
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,952
 Around 7 million years ago,

50
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,955
 there were no chimpanzees
 and there were no humans.

51
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,257
 But there were CHLCAs,

52
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,892
 an acronym which stands for

53
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,828
 "Chimpanzee-Human
 Last Common Ancestor."

54
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,563
 Like us,
 CHLCAs didn't have

55
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:50,001
 great natural offenses
 or defenses,

56
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:53,638
 protective shells or claws,
 fangs or venom.

57
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,741
 So living in the safety
 of the trees was great.

58
00:02:56,742 --> 00:03:00,445
 Those who stayed became
 the chimps we know today.

59
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,947
 But for reasons we're still
 not quite sure of,

60
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:06,985
 some of the CHLCAs decided
to venture down to the savanna.

61
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,787
 Without appropriate
 physical abilities,

62
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:13,291
 things like cooperation,
 imagining new strategies,

63
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:17,362
 and the assigning of roles
 were necessary for survival,

64
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,297
 all of which are easier
 if you have

65
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,932
 a rich collection of symbols

66
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,735
 that can refer to things
 across time:

67
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,503
 language.

68
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,472
 Many different types
 of creatures emerged

69
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,374
 with varying adaptations.

70
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,643
 But today, only one member
 of the family remains.

71
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,711
 Us.

72
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:36,781
Language as we know it may have
been one of the strategies

73
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,550
that kept us alive
in the savanna.

74
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,420
But where did it move in?

75
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:44,822
The brains of those
who developed language

76
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:47,025
and those who didn't
aren't totally different.

77
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:51,362
A brand-new brain structure
didn't just pop into existence.

78
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:54,866
Instead, anatomy used
for other tasks

79
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,535
must have been sacrificed.

80
00:03:57,536 --> 00:04:00,438
And as it turns out,
for beautiful reasons,

81
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,940
detailed short-term memory

82
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,710
may have been
a fair thing to lose

83
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:08,446
in return for language.

84
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:11,949
This trade-off
between memory and language

85
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:25,530
is the Cognitive Tradeoff
Hypothesis.

86
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,031
 The Cognitive Tradeoff
 Hypothesis

87
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:29,767
 is the culmination
 of decades of work

88
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,569
 by one of the world's leading
 primatologists,

89
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,638
 Professor Tetsuro Matsuzawa

90
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,941
 of Kyoto University's
 Primate Research Institute.

91
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,644
 Founded in 1967,

92
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,380
 the institute was created
 for scientific research

93
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:45,583
 in association with the nearby
 Japan Monkey Center.

94
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,653
The collaborative centers house
 over 60 species

95
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:54,392
 and nearly 1,000 primates who
 live and play in open spaces.

96
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:56,027
Look at monkeys.

97
00:04:56,028 --> 00:05:08,506
[monkeys chitter]

98
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:12,543
Is there a baby
on that one?

99
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,078
-[Michael] Six months?
-[Tetsuro] Yes.

100
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:23,554
[gibbers]

101
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:27,592
That's where they live.

102
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,628
[Michael]
Can you do it?

103
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,797
[grunts]

104
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:35,733
 Dr. Matsuzawa has spent
 over 40 years

105
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,002
 researching
 non-human primates.

106
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,104
 He splits his time
 between fieldwork

107
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,639
 in the West African country
 of Guinea,

108
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,408
 and here in Japan,

109
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,842
 where he and his colleagues
 have developed

110
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,778
 a chimpanzee habitat

111
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,113
 designed to mimic life
 in the wild.

112
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:52,717
This habitat is home to Skylab,
 a working laboratory

113
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:55,720
 set high atop the chimpanzee''
 climbing structure.

114
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,789
 In this open air lab,

115
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,758
 chimpanzees are free
 to come and go as they please.

116
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,060
And this is how you move?

117
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,896
 If they decide to stay,

118
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,765
 they participate
 in cognitively enriching tasks

119
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,867
 designed to mimic
 foraging behavior.

120
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:13,638
 When the chimpanzees are
 interested in participating,

121
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,006
 they enter one of Skylab's

122
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,874
 specially designed
 computer booths,

123
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,644
 where a camera uses
 facial recognition software

124
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,146
 to recognize them
 and select a test

125
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:24,015
 based that particular chimp's
 current familiarity

126
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,050
 with the task.

127
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,985
 Each trial takes about as long

128
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,621
 as it would for a chimp
 to forage a single bite.

129
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:32,790
 And each morsel
 of food they get

130
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,892
 is accounted for
 in their diet.

131
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:37,695
Do the doors open
when they approach?

132
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:41,065
No human even needs to be...?

133
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,468
 So, what is for us
 a great way to collect data,

134
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,936
 is for them an experience

135
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,904
 similar in many ways

136
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:50,107
 to what they would be doing
 in the wild.

137
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,009
Impressive.

138
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,679
 Dr. Matsuzawa has been running
 memory tests like these

139
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,815
 on chimpanzees since 1978.

140
00:06:57,816 --> 00:06:59,984
 His research has shown
 the phenomenal

141
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,520
 and nearly photographic
 short-term memory

142
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,655
 of these primates.

143
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:08,192
 Two of the most famous chimps
 at the PRI are Ai,

144
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,661
 named after the Japanese word
 for "love,"

145
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,965
 and her son Ayumu,
 whose name means "walk."

146
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,234
 What can we learn
 about ourselves

147
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,904
 by studying chimpanzees
 like them?

148
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,639
 Well, I want to find out.

149
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,141
If we and chimpanzees
come from a common ancestor,

150
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:29,680
what can explain the split
where the chimpanzees

151
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:33,518
don't seem to need
or to develop language

152
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,886
like we did?

153
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:53,004
Why would that happen?
Was it an accident?

154
00:07:53,005 --> 00:08:09,320
Ah-ha.

155
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,589
Our habitat...

156
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,258
provided a pressure
to develop language.

157
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:20,331
Yes.

158
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:22,300
-That's incredible.
-Mm.

159
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,569
So, in a way, we should be
really grateful

160
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,271
that our ancestors
were so weak,

161
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:37,181
they got pushed
out of the trees.

162
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:40,117
[thumping]

163
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,985
-Bang, bang.
-[laughs]

164
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:44,889
[Michael] I'd invite you to be
a part of this interview,

165
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:53,965
but you don't have language.

166
00:08:53,966 --> 00:09:09,280
Right now.

167
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:12,750
Mm-hmm.

168
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,352
Quick decisions.

169
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:27,865
Our ancestors didn't have
that same pressure?

170
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:54,091
Hmm.

171
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,027
[Michael] The Cognitive
 Tradeoff Hypothesis

172
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,363
 suggests that in the dangerous
 world beyond the trees,

173
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:03,100
 early humans needed
 to teach each other

174
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,902
 and use abstract symbols
 that could refer

175
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,937
 not just to the immediate
 here and now,

176
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:10,107
 but to hypotheticals
 and generalities.

177
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:13,310
 Making room for that kind
 of abstract thinking

178
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:16,747
meant sacrificing the immediate
 and detailed memory

179
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:22,386
 of their ancestors.

180
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:32,430
Yeah.

181
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,232
I'm able to imagine
past and future.

182
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,235
I'm able to describe things
in an abstract way.

183
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,837
And I don't need the details,

184
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,872
because I have the label.

185
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:49,947
So it seems like a pretty good
trade-off.

186
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:56,353
Yeah.

187
00:10:56,354 --> 00:11:06,430
Yeah.

188
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:08,733
What a great message, right?

189
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:13,437
Sharing is what makes us "us."

190
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:17,274
I would love to see your
working memory tests

191
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,143
on chimpanzees in action.

192
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:22,947
I would also really love
to participate myself

193
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,282
and see how well I can do
compared to a chimpanzee.

194
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:26,817
Yes.

195
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:28,352
Have you ever had
a human and a chimpanzee

196
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:32,923
compete like that
together?

197
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:34,391
-[hooting]
-[Michael] They're excited

198
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,994
-about the idea too.
-[laughs]

199
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:47,538
[gibbering]

200
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:51,308
[Michael]
An opportunity to do the memory
 task just like a chimpanzee

201
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,010
 is really special.

202
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,845
 Who knows how it will go?

203
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:59,917
 Let's see who shows up.

204
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,086
-[clapping]
-[Michael] Yeah!

205
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,288
You're really good
at this, Ai.

206
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:07,391
 Looks like today,
it will be celebrity chimp, Ai.

207
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:10,161
 Ai is older now,
 and just like in humans,

208
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,897
 her cognitive abilities
 have decreased with time.

209
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:19,303
 So I may actually
 stand a chance.

210
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:21,572
 To face off against Ai,

211
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,307
 I will be sitting in the booth
 next to her.

212
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:27,111
 Normally, her son Ayumu
 plays against her.

213
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,446
 But today, well,
she's in for some Michael time.

214
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:34,185
I'm not your child, though,
am I?

215
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,454
 The tests are going
 to get harder as we go along.

216
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:40,224
 How will my memory compare
 to that of a chimp

217
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:43,527
 who never made
 the same cognitive trade-off?

218
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,429
[exhales]

219
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,598
 In the first round,
 the task is to remember

220
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,868
where each of the three numbers
 are in numerical order.

221
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,570
 But here's the trick:

222
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,605
 as soon as I touch
 one of them on the screen,

223
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:57,541
 the other two will
 be covered by solid squares,

224
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:00,177
 so I can no longer see
 where they are.

225
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:03,147
 Now, well,
 it's up to my memory.

226
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:11,989
[Tetsuro]
Okay, let's go.

227
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,490
[Michael]
 If I make a mistake,

228
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,526
 I get an error noise
 like this...

229
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,094
[buzzer]

230
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,295
 ...while a correct answer

231
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,496
 sounds like this.

232
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,131
[computer chirps]

233
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,867
 When the chimpanzee
 gets it right,

234
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,102
 they are rewarded
 with apples.

235
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,972
 The human, me, well,
 just gets the bragging rights.

236
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,273
I'm not getting apples.

237
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:30,608
[laughs]

238
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,509
[computer chirps]

239
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,214
You really actually have
to focus more than I expected.

240
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,515
Almost messed that one up.

241
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:43,587
[buzzer]

242
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:50,160

[Tetsuro]

244
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,434
How did Michael do?

245
00:13:57,435 --> 00:14:03,540
95.

246
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,942
[Michael]
 On my first run,

247
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:11,215
 I've managed to beat Ai.

248
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,284
What is the next task?

249
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:24,461
How many symbols?

250
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:25,930
Whoa.

251
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,131
[computer chirps]

252
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,233
This is a lot harder.

253
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,502
 This game is similar
 to the last,

254
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,604
 but starts a little bit
 differently.

255
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:37,074
 This time, three numbers
 appear on a blank screen,

256
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,642
 but as soon as I touch
 the first one,

257
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:43,213
 the entire screen
 is covered in boxes.

258
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:47,384
[computer chirps]

259
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:52,957
Whew.

[Michael]
Ai...

264
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,747
you having fun?

265
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:25,189
-Whoa!
-[grunts]

266
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,093
 Ai is used to Ayumu, her son,
 playing the game beside her,

267
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:33,263
 so my presence
 may be throwing her off.

268
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:34,665
I'm here for moral support, Ai.

269
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,034
 It was fun squaring off
 against Ai,

270
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:45,242
 but I want to see how I would
 do against her son, Ayumu.

271
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,710
I'm ready.

272
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:49,146
Okay...

273
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:52,216
[Michael] Ayumu is currently
 Matsuzawa's best pupil,

274
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,786
 able to ace the memory tests
 at blazingly fast speeds.

275
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,222
[computer chirps]

276
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:02,459
 But today, Ayumu is not
 interested in mental combat.

277
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,728
 He's busy flirting
 with some young ladies

278
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,764
 who live with him
 here at the PRI.

279
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,166
 And since free choice
 is the guiding principle

280
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,603
 of Matsuzawa's research,
 we can't make him join us.

281
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,572
 The good news is that
 Ayumu doesn't need to be here

282
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:17,541
 for me to compete
 against him.

283
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,644
 The game can be presented
 to me just as Ayumu does it:

284
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,547
 with nine numerals.

285
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,549
 Let's see if my luck
 is the same against Ayumu

286
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:32,523
 as it was against Ai.

287
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:37,461
Oh, man.

288
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:39,696
Okay.

289
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,331
-[buzzer]
-Wow.

290
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,567
[laughs]

291
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:50,374
Even when I take time
I can't do it right.

292
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:58,849
Okay, more time.

294
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:06,557
I thought I had that one.

295
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,127
It takes a long time to memorize
nine numerals' positions.

296
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:14,530
[buzzer]

297
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:21,472
It's embarrassing
how long this takes me.

298
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:26,577
I can do this one.

299
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,580
[computer chirps]

300
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,549
All right.

301
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:40,858
Yeah.

302
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,829
You don't need
to laugh about it.

303
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:52,836
Thirteen.

304
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:58,242
I got better, yeah,
because you were pressuring me.

305
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,845
Jesus.

306
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:06,783
Six times worse,
six times slower.

307
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:10,888
Yeah. I would love to.

308
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:16,160
[Michael] This is the most
 difficult test.

309
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,296
 I have to remember all nine
 numbers in numerical order

310
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,198
 at Ayumu's speed,

311
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,300
 which is to say,
 I have to do

312
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:24,735
 what I could
 barely do before,

313
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,303
 but now I have
 to memorize them all

314
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:27,504
 within the amount of time

315
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:31,909
 it takes to blink.

316
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,180
So I get half a second
to prepare?

317
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,781
I'm going to prove you wrong.

318
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,784
 As a reminder,
 this is how Ayumu performs,

319
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:45,689
 which is standard
 for a young chimp.

320
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,791
You got to be kidding me.

Well, I hope this was
helpful for you.

to study as a primate,

-I give myself to you.

Wow.

And we need to make sure
to preserve them.

-They're already endangered.
-Yes.

348
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,569
And yet they are our closest
link to understanding

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,405
what we came from

Mm.

 use complex
 symbolic language

357

 doesn't make us any better
 than any other species.

 It just means that the path
 we took required it.

00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,472
 In fact, in some ways
 we aren't better,

360
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,040
 because we can talk.

361
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:54,478
 Today, we study those
 who took different paths

362
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,546
 as a way to learn
 more about ourselves.

363
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:59,950
 If we lose them,
 we lose part of our story,

364
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,785
 where we came from,

365
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,420
 who we are,

366
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:05,522
 and who we can be
 in the future.

367
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:09,926
[gibbering]

368
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:12,429
[shrieks]

369
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,697
 And, as always,

370
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:16,833
 thanks for watching.

371
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:20,437
 This season,
 on Mind Field.

372
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,639
I will die.

373
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,940
But should I?

374
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:29,679
I want to perform
a reverse exorcism.

375
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,850
There was like
a glowing figure, man.

376
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:36,420
[man]

377
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:40,690
I would love to do the Stanford
prison experiment again.

378
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,659
There, let's blast them again.
Number three.

379
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,095
[electricity hums]

380
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:46,696
Have you ever had a human

381
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:48,532
and a chimpanzee compete
like that together?

382
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,966
You having fun?

383
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,868
-Whoa!
-No, not really.

384
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,603
[shrieks]

385
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:55,872
I am going to make
my hometown

386
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:57,941
function like a brain.

387
00:22:57,942 --> 00:23:00,644
[cheering]

388
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:05,148
Doing a good moral deed can
actually make you more likely

389
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,117
to do something immoral.

390
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:10,086
We're going to see if we
can get people to allow a child

391
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,189
to take the blame
for a crime they committed.

392
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,090
-How old are you, son?
-Twelve.

393
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:15,892
[guard] We're going to need
to talk to the police.

394
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:18,929
This facility is where you both
cryo-preserve people

395
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,831
and store them.

396
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,968
We have 159 patients
in these tanks.

397
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:28,772
We're offering an unknown
extension of human lifespan.

398
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:31,942
-[Michael] You spied
on their dream.
-Yeah.

399
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,977
That's pretty spooky.

400
00:23:33,978 --> 00:23:36,847
[Michael] We received a message
from outer space.

401
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:40,250
Please figure out
what this message is saying.

402
00:23:40,251 --> 00:24:10,247
-[man] You ready?
-I'm ready.

403
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,949
Hey, I have to leave
and go over to the next episode,

404
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,184
but you can come with me.

405
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,286
Click below to check out
the next episode of Mind Field.

406
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,023
I'll see you there.
