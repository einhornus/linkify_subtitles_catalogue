00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,469
Vsauce. Today we're gonna be covering a topic that is very close to my heart.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,709
Clever uses of YouTube's technologies.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,009
Now, I've always had a lot of fun messing around with stuff like the loading c...

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,769
circle and annotations.
But,

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,349
let's take a safari today through
things other YouTubers have done. Other

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,499
creative ways they've come up with using

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,409
what YouTube offers. Now obviously in this
one video we can't cover everything, so

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,069
please,

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,589
leave in the comments below other cool
things you found other YouTubers

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,759
doing. We're gonna start things off with Skittles' touch. These videos are pretty new,

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,839
but they let you physically get involved,
or at least with your

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,039
finger. I won't ruin the ending to that one,
but I also like the cage cop

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,389
version. Your finger helps fight crime.
By the way, there are links to all of these

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,799
videos for your own enjoyment

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,768
in the description. Back when YouTube
first supported widescreen, freddiew celebrated

16
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:52,009
by

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,099
interacting with the site itself.
He fought

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,789
and murdered the very letterboxing
surrounding him.

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,349
Joe Sabia has built a lot of really awesome clever things.

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,149
He's the guy who made the Oscar's 'Spot the
difference' video where you have to have a

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,559
eye

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,739
and find the differences and click the
answer to keep moving on

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,339
and on and on.
Joe also made this brilliant slot machine

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,459
where you have to click each wheel at just the right time

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,008
to complete a character.
MysteryGuitarMan was behind this

26
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:24,489
super creative interactive piano, where you could
make him play a song,

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,968
but I think the first person to explore
this fun idea was kokokaka

28
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:32,398
and play the piano.
In videos like these you have to let the whole

29
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,849
thing load and then you click on the actual piano keys

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,858
and they move you to the time code where that note is played.

31
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:42,449
I'm also a huge fan of this interactive
bass guitar because you can play the

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:42,908
notes

33
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,879
by just typing the numbers on your keyboard.
For instance, here I am using

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,639
this sequence to play a little song.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,849
But let's stop playing around and get
narrative. There are a lot of great choose

36
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,559
your join adventure stories on YouTube,

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,859
but one of my favorites is Lego Spider,
where you help get a spider

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,469
off of your friend's head.
The music, by the way, is just incredible.

39
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,919
But if music and dancing is all you want,
go with the mixable dancer.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,199
It's simple, but something about the costume and the dark background makes it

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,619
just crazy enough.

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,818
If you prefer magic, be sure to check out
the old classic YouTube magic card trick,

43
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,798
if you haven't already.

44
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:30,699
It was made back when YouTube first
implemented annotations.

45
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,339
The famous street fighter stop-motion
game from Patrick Boivin

46
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,869
was actually the inspiration behind my
Chris Brown punch out game. You have to

47
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,689
give it a try.

48
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,719
All of those idea used a lot of annotations,

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,159
but MysteryGuitarMan took it in a
different direction by including

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,669
hidden annotations in his videos that
viewers had to scavenger hunt to find

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,029
to get secret words.
Boone Oakley took it one step

52
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,828
even further.
They're an ad agency whose actual website

53
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:01,919
is a YouTube video. The links on the side here navigate you around and they even

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,138
have arrows hard-wired into the video

55
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,359
that show you where to drag the play-head to see specific things.

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,108
Now it's your turn.
Remember any fun tricks or

57
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,318
cool ideas that some other YouTuber did
that wasn't covered here? Well,

58
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,018
let us know in the comments below

59
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,379
or post those videos to Facebook.com/vsaucegaming.

60
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,229
I'm talking cool contests, nifty ways to get guys involved or just

61
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,988
other surprising uses of the
technology. I wanna see more of these things,

62
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,528
so let us now.

63
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:30,748
And as always,

64
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:32,389
thanks for watching.
