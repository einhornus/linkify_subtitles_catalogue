00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,679
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If you were driving in a car

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,379
at the speed of light and you turned on your headlights

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,399
what would happen? Would light be able to come out

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,808
or would your headlights just stay dark?

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,139
Or maybe, light would come out but it just pull up

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,538
inside the headlight like a overflowing sink.

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:27,559
Or maybe the light would come out but at
twice the speed of light - at its normal

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,659
speed plus the speed of your car.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,199
No, that doesn't sound right. None of these
answers sound right because,

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,648
of course, there is no answer.

11
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,939
A car cannot travel at the speed

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,179
of light. Nothing that has mass can.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,339
But come on, you say, there are things
that can travel at the speed of light.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,409
Things that have no mass, like photons. Let's build a car

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,538
out of light. Okay.

16
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,108
Let's take that suggestion because imagining what it is like

17
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,999
to be light, brings up a lot of questions about

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,359
light, about why things are the way they are

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,509
and about whether or not we are real.

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,949
In order to see what I mean we need to
talk about "C".

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,819
The speed of light.

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,869
It is Constant. As long as you aren't
accelarating, you can move as fast or

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,599
slow or

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,759
in whatever direction you want and you will still

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,899
always see light moving at light

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,499
speed. Even when light appears to slow
down, as it passes through different

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,429
materials,

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,729
the actual photons themselves are still
always traveling at "C".

29
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,999
They're just taking a longer path, which takes

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,029
more time. This law always holds true
because whenever you move,

31
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,089
relative to other things, your
measurements of them and their

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,269
measurements of you

33
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:58,529
change. When you move, everything not
moving with you appears to you to be

34
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,199
shortened

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,859
in length and to be experiencing time more slowly.

36
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,789
Whereas to everything else, it is you
that these changes happen to.

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,069
These changes really happen - just not
noticeably or measurably at the speeds

38
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,599
we usually travel at.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,929
For example, while walking to your
refrigerator for a snack,

40
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,669
you will measure your fridge to be a 100 quadrillionth

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,469
of a meter nearer and thinner than you
would while at rest with it.

42
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,739
You'll also notice that it experiences time more slowly

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,379
than you. Each one of its seconds
will be a 100 quadrillionth

44
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,488
of a second longer than yours. But your fridge

45
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,809
will measure that these transformations are
happening to you.

46
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,529
These are small numbers, but at speeds
nearer the speed of light

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,659
these changes can be dramatic. As I
mentioned in an earlier video,

48
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:54,159
to a particle racing toward Earth at
99.9999999999991%

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,559
the entire Earth would only appear to be

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,649
70 meters deep. Our whole planet.

51
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,708
Now with all of this in mind, let's take a
look at headlights

52
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,238
being used by a stationary ship and one that is moving

53
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,489
at 99 percent the speed of light.

54
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,749
The Near Light Speed Ship would be
flattened in the direction of its travel

55
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,469
to us,

56
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,429
while a stationary one would not. As their
headlights come on

57
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,019
the light coming from both ships travels
at the same rate.

58
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,279
The speed of a lights' source doesn't
push it faster.

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,689
The moving ships velocity does, however,
give its headlight energy

60
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,179
in the direction it's headed, causing a
blue shift from the front and a red shift

61
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,109
from behind.

62
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,329
What's really cool though is that this
is just what

63
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,159
we would see, floating in space at rest
with the stationary ship.

64
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,568
The crew of the fast-moving ship
wouldn't see their beams, only gradually

65
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,389
gaining on them

66
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,079
like we do, they would see it exactly
what the crew the stationary ships sees.

67
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,818
Light beams rapidly fleeing their
headlights at the speed of light

68
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,389
just as if they were moving at all. And
here's why. Let's say this distance

69
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,809
is a light second. The distance light
travels in one second. Which is

70
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,719
299,792,458 meters.

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,479
Now, after one of our seconds, sure enough,

72
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,169
both beams will have traveled a light
second. But the crew of the moving ship

73
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,389
measures light speed to be the same as us.

74
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,379
But how does that make sense?
I mean, light hasn't traveled a light second from

75
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,409
them yet. No problem. You see, what they
measure a light second to be

76
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,409
is shorter than what we measure. And

77
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,779
they wouldn't agree that a second has
passed yet either. Because, of course, to

78
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,239
us

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,859
time is slower for them. They count one
second finishing later then we do,

80
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,749
at which point their light has, indeed,
traveled one of their light seconds

81
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,049
from them. Observers will often disagree

82
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,679
about time and space, but those
disagreements with always conspire

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,679
to make sure they agree on one thing.
The speed of light.

84
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,429
It is always the same for everyone.

85
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,679
But what if you were travelling

86
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,959
at the speed of light? Well, the only
thing that could do that would be a

87
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,939
massless vehicle. So, fine, let's assume
that we can build one.

88
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,129
Such a vehicle would travel with

89
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,609
light. Light would never even pull

90
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,809
a tiny tiny bit ahead of it. No matter how short

91
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,168
it thought a meter was. No matter how long
it thought a second was.

92
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,719
It would never register light ever moving ahead of it.

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,049
It would say that light was stationary.
It would not agree that light travelled

94
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,939
at the speed of light. Right? Not really.

95
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,679
You see, at the speed of light there is nothing

96
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,579
to see. Not because there's nothing to
see but because there is nothing

97
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,839
to do any seeing.

98
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,549
As we have seen, as an object's velocity approaches

99
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,189
"C", time for everything around it approaches

100
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,369
a standstill. An object

101
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,418
traveling very very very very very very
near the speed of light

102
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,809
could travel for billions of our years

103
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,969
before a single second past for it.

104
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,129
But a massless vehicle, travelling at the speed of light,

105
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,258
could travel forever

106
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,418
before an instant even began for it.

107
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,688
It experiences no time.

108
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,998
And it would have no time to do anything.

109
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,149
Certainly no time to turn on its

110
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,228
headlights. The concept of time doesn't even really

111
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,628
apply. A massless vehicle couldn't even
have its headlights on

112
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,619
before it hits "C", because object with no
mass

113
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,079
must always travel at "C". Such an object

114
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,788
would never have a before. Its origin,

115
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,179
its journey and its destination are simultaneous for it.

116
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,339
A billion light year trip from a distant quasar

117
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,508
might take a photon a billion years

118
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,598
to us. But it literally takes no time

119
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,249
for the photon. And to the photon, the
distance to us from that quasar

120
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,359
is literally nothing. Photons

121
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,079
are how we see. How we know anything
about our place in the universe,

122
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,378
and the energy they bring our planet from the Sun is responsible for nearly

123
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,549
all life on Earth. But despite that list
of accomplishments,

124
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,149
they don't think much of themselves.

125
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,199
In fact, as far as they're concerned, they

126
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,609
don't even exist. Outside observers, of course,

127
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,089
see them and would measure them to be
moving along at the speed of light

128
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,179
with nothing passing or gaining on them.
So if you were moving

129
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,439
at the speed of light, you'd have to be massless,

130
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,709
like a photon,

131
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,569
and you wouldn't notice anything, because to
you there would be nothing,

132
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,259
and no time to notice it. Other people
would see you doing nothing

133
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,629
and you would be unaware of yourself. You
could never turn on headlights

134
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,479
because you would feel exactly like you
felt before you were conceived.

135
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,399
But why is the speed of light what it is?

136
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,009
I mean, this is how far light travels

137
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,119
in a second. Could it also travel

138
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,909
this far, or this far, or this far?
Could we conceive of a universe where light

139
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,499
traveled

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,709
that quickly? Yeah, easily.

141
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,309
So then, why is it that the universe we live in

142
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,699
is only one of these ways? Why are the laws

143
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,849
of physics what they are? Instead of

144
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,928
some other way they could be.

145
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:43,609
Well, there are a lot of theories, but so
far we're not exactly sure how to

146
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,939
test any of them, because we are stuck in this

147
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,969
universe and don't yet know how to
create universes of our own

148
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,269
for experiments. But perhaps there is
something we have yet to discover that

149
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,199
compels

150
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,999
reality to be this way, and only this way. 

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,109
Or, perhaps, nothing compels it to be this
way but instead

152
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,559
there's a multiverse. Every single possible universe

153
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,769
exists. Some of them collapsed
immediately, some of them are empty and dark,

154
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,449
some of them involve you watching this very video but

155
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,789
Earth has two Suns.

156
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,479
For those of you, in that universe
watching, that was probably very confusing

157
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,099
what I just say

158
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,689
because your Earth does have two Suns.
But the point is, the multiverse

159
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,579
would be a pretty elegant explanation. 
Or maybe,

160
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,399
universes are born inside black holes.

161
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,879
Universes whose physical laws are only
slightly different from the universe

162
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,169
that gave birth to it.

163
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,969
In this way, universes could replicate
according to natural selection.

164
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,569
Universes that are more fit for creating black holes

165
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,689
would then have more baby universes,

166
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,709
making universes that support black
holes more common,

167
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,009
like maybe the one that we're in. And that's
pretty lucky because universes that

168
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,229
support black holes

169
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,588
support Suns, and us.

170
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,139
Or - and here's my favorite theory -

171
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,469
maybe we're just living in a simulation.
And someone or something else

172
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,079
programmed it up.

173
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,699
That sounds pretty sci-fi.

174
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,949
Sure. But I like how Julian Baggini puts it in

175
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,789
"The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten".
If you assume, that at some point in time,

176
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,499
virtual reality could become good enough
that even its own inhabitants

177
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,219
didn't know they were in a simulation,
and if you assume

178
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,519
creating such simulations would be way

179
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,209
easier than creating real
flesh-and-blood creatures

180
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,369
that require an entire universe
and billions of years.

181
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,249
Well, then it's pretty easy to conclude that
many many many many more simulated,

182
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,769
faked beings could be created than real ones.

183
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,239
Say, 999 fake ones for every one

184
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,039
real one.

185
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,949
What's more likely? 
That you're part of the 0.1%

186
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,699
that are real, or that you are part the 99.9%

187
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,119
who think they're real but

188
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,349
aren't. Perhaps, we live in a simulation
created by some other

189
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,619
intelligent species. John Gribbin,

190
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,289
however, points out one possible way to
dismiss this idea:

191
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,399
irrational numbers. Like the square root of 2 

192
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,889
or Pi. These numbers don't

193
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,099
end. I mean, they contain a never-ending,

194
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,369
never repeating sequence of digits, which
would mean that whoever programmed this

195
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,409
universe could

196
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,409
fit in all of, say, Pi.

197
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,129
So, if in our tireless pursuit of
calculating more and more and more

198
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,309
digits of Pi,

199
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,489
we ever run into an endlessly repeating series

200
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,259
or the end, that could be a pretty good sign that we live

201
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,969
in a simulation. A universe that is not real.

202
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,199
But so far we haven't found that and we
don't think that we will.

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,919
So, thank you irrational numbers, for keeping

204
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,958
it real.

205
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,118
And as always,

206
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,859
thanks for watching.
