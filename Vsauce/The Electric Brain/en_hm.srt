1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:09,140
The nervous system
is fundamentally electric.

2
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:10,375
When we move our arm,

3
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:11,676
it moves because a signal

4
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,211
has been sent to the muscle

5
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,512
that controls it,

6
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:16,414
and that message
is made of charged atoms

7
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:19,150
moving in and out
of nerve cells.

8
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:20,852
It's electricity.

9
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:22,554
Now, because the brain
is electric,

10
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,756
we could also use
electricity to record

11
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:26,524
what the brain is doing

12
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,860
or bypass it entirely,

13
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:31,629
-and control a body.
-[beep]

14
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,865
That means that
we could use our minds

15
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,334
to move other people's bodies,

16
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:38,736
restore movement to people
who are paralyzed,

17
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:41,473
feel through an artificial hand
as if it was our own,

18
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,776
and even read people's minds.

19
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,377
Shocking!

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:01:07,732
[theme music playing]

21
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,434
Even though electricity

22
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:10,635
wasn't really understood

23
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:12,237
until the 1800s,

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,405
its ability
to influence the body

25
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:15,740
had been known since at least

26
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,308
ancient Roman times,

27
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:18,776
when respected physician

28
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,645
Scribonius Largus

29
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:21,779
 wrote about a man

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,348
 who accidentally stepped

31
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,816
 on an electric fish

32
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,785
 and was suddenly relieved
 of gout pain.

33
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,487
Scribonius did some experiments

34
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:31,789
and found that you could put
an electric fish

35
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,560
 on your head
 and relieve headaches.

36
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,928
In 1804,

37
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,530
centuries later,

38
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,832
 Italian physicist
 Giovanni Aldini

39
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,401
 discovered he could make
 people's muscles move

40
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:45,170
 with electricity.

41
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,504
He amazed the European world

42
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:47,739
by using electricity

43
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,374
to animate the corpse

44
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,942
of an executed criminal.

45
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,211
 The corpse opened its eyes

46
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:55,547
 and even seemed to sit up.

47
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,284
But Aldini wasn't just
trying to shock people.

48
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,452
He was showing the world
that neurons,

49
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:02,887
the cells that control both

50
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:05,223
our thoughts and our movements,

51
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:07,725
operate through electricity.

52
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:17,702
[buzzing]

53
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:20,805
Imagine bypassing
a person's brain

54
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:24,375
so as to control their body.

55
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:25,810
Now normally
when you move your body,

56
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,812
your brain sends
electrical signals

57
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,247
through nerves.

58
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,982
But if we could use electrodes

59
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,350
to send those signals,

60
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,519
we could control
a person's body

61
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,287
without needing their brain
to be involved.

62
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:38,323
We could control them
with a remote control,

63
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,925
and that's what
we are about to do today

64
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:49,334
with cockroaches.

65
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,769
I'm here with Tim Marzullo
from Backyard Brains,

66
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,305
and, Tim, you brought
some cockroaches.

67
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,608
[Tim] Yes, Michael,
cockroaches use their antenna

68
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,643
to sense their environment
and move around,

69
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:01,246
and we're going to try
to trick the cockroach

70
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,847
and control
its movement

71
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,716
for a number
of minutes.

72
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,984
Trick it, how do we trick it?

73
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,853
We are going to do a surgery
on the cockroach

74
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,688
where we're going to hijack
the nervous system

75
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,590
to send electrical impulses
to their antenna.

76
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,325
[Michael] All right,
well, let's get to it.

77
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:16,027
-[Tim] Let's do it.
-[Michael] I've brought with me

78
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:18,730
today a state-of-the-art
cockroach operating room.

79
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,832
Now, how do you do surgery
on a cockroach?

80
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,801
We have a jar of ice water,
and to induce anesthesia

81
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,637
we are going to put
the cockroaches

82
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,872
in the ice water
and their nervous system

83
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:30,341
will stop firing
electrical impulses.

84
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:32,343
We'll notice after a minute
or two they'll stop moving.

85
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:34,412
 [Michael] Once the roaches
 were anesthetized,

86
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,414
 they were ready
 for surgery.

87
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:37,749
[Tim] All right,
so then now what we're gonna do

88
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,484
is attach the electrodes.

89
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,718
So here we have
the little connector.

90
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,420
It has three wires.
It has a ground wire,

91
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,755
and it has a wire
for the left antenna

92
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,556
and the right antenna.

93
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:47,558
I'm going to put
a little bead of Superglue

94
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,327
on the cockroach right here,

95
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:51,462
and then I'm just gonna
stick the electrode

96
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,998
on the cockroach's head.

97
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,334
 [Michael] Next,
 we inserted the ground wire

98
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,703
 into the flight muscle
 of the wing.

99
00:03:58,704 --> 00:03:59,904
-[Tim] There you go.
-[Michael] Cool.

100
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,472
[Tim] I put the wire
in the back.

101
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,907
[Michael]
 The remaining two wires

102
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,976
 get inserted
 into the antenna.

103
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:06,711
[Tim] Now I'm just
gonna snip the antenna

104
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:08,346
right there and we...

105
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:09,814
[Michael] And now because
it's a hollow tube...

106
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:11,015
...we can stick
the wire in.

107
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,917
[Tim] So now,
what I'm gonna do

108
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,320
is I'm just gonna insert it
into the antenna.

109
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,455
-All right?
-[Michael] Got it, wow.

110
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,824
[Tim] And he's ready
for the left antenna.

111
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:21,725
There we go.
It went right in there.

112
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,061
I'll put the cockroach

113
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,630
right back in the ice water.

114
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,999
Now it's worth pointing out
what this does to them

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
and to their quality of life.

116
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:30,868
[Tim] Yeah, after the surgery

117
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,070
I'm gonna take them back
to their homes,

118
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,338
snip the wires,
and these cockroaches

119
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,739
will then be retired.

120
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,474
[Michael] And the antenna
will grow back?

121
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:39,377
[Tim] Yes, and I will return
them to our reproducing colony,

122
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:40,678
and they'll live happy
cockroach lives

123
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,046
after the show.

124
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,881
-[Michael] Fantastic.
-[Tim] All right.

125
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,750
-So now we're ready to go.
-[Michael] Wonderful.

126
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,653
 Our cyber-roach
 was now neurologically wired

127
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,755
 for external control.

128
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:52,790
[Michael] This is
a state-of-the-art

129
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,492
roach racetrack.

130
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:56,861
Tim and I are about
to take some robo-roaches

131
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,129
for a test drive.

132
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,430
But first, Tim,

133
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,599
I wanna see how
an ordinary roach

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,768
moves around
and uses its antenna.

135
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:04,936
[Tim] So let's just see
where this guy goes.

136
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,003
He wants to explore my hand.

137
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:07,538
All right,
and then, oh wow.

138
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,873
-Wow.
-Racin' away.

139
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:10,942
And you can you see
he's hugging that wall.

140
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,578
You can see he keeps tapping
the wall and moving along.

141
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,046
He's not in the middle
of the road,

142
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,681
-he's on the edge of it.
-[Michael] Yeah.

143
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,783
 As we know,
 roaches use their antennas

144
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,618
 to explore their surroundings

145
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,020
 and locate food and shelter.

146
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,757
 When no walls or obstacles
 were sensed,

147
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,158
 the roaches felt free

148
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,926
 to move around at will.

149
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:30,595
-Hey, guys...
-[Tim] Hey, whoa, whoa.

150
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,696
[Michael] follow the rules.

151
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,498
 It was time to test-drive

152
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,400
 our robo-roach.

153
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,001
[Michael] So this
is the battery,

154
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,803
along with
the Bluetooth device.

155
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,438
[Tim] And I'm just gonna plug
them in right now.

156
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,540
[Michael] We're talking
about actual voltages.

157
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,575
[Tim] Yes, because
we are talking to the nerves

158
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:46,411
in a language that
the nerves understand.

159
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,012
 [Michael] Tim has built an app

160
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,480
 that communicates
 to the electrode

161
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,715
 on the roach's back.

162
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:51,916
 When we swipe right,

163
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,551
 the electrode sends a signal

164
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:54,952
 to the roach's left antenna,

165
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,555
 stimulating the sensation
 of an obstacle

166
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,724
 on its left
 which causes the roach

167
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:02,126
 to move right and vice versa.

168
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:03,728
Which way should we go,
left or right?

169
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,896
I think we should go left.

170
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,198
Left. Whoa.

171
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,866
-[Tim] Okay, well, that's...
-[Michael] Doing donuts.

172
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:10,701
All right, that was
a little bit too high.

173
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:12,870
[Michael] We adjusted
 the intensity of the signal

174
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,072
 to find the optimal setting.

175
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:17,775
All right, now, I'm gonna try
to get him to turn right,

176
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:19,110
go back through the factory.

177
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,645
-[Tim] Oh.
-[Michael] Good job.

178
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,979
-[Tim] Okay, very good.
-[Michael] Good job.

179
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,549
Now he doesn't know
if there's a road,

180
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,584
so I'm gonna have to tell him
to kind of keep going

181
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:28,152
-to the right, good.
-[Tim] Okay, very good.

182
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:30,221
-[Michael]
 Yeah, good, come here.
-All right, where is he?

183
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,789
Did he just-- he wants to go
to the hot air balloon?

184
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,124
He wants to go
to the hot air balloon,

185
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,226
but I would rather
he go to work

186
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,794
at the factory,
so I'm gonna-- I'm gonna...

187
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:37,995
He's like,
"I'll go back to work."

188
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:39,464
[Michael] I'm gonna swipe left.

189
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,732
-[Tim] Okay.
-There, good. All right, left.

190
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,034
-[Tim] Very good.
-[Michael] Now right.

191
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,069
-[Tim] Ooh. All right.
-[Michael] Good.

192
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,004
-[Michael] All right,
 watch this. And turn right.
-[Tim] Okay.

193
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,206
[Michael] Good, good, good.
Turn right.

194
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,874
[Tim] All right,
turns a little bit.

195
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,576
-[Michael] Turn right, oh.
-[Tim] Oh, you see

196
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,177
-he adapts over time.
-[Michael] He adapts over time.

197
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,812
So we are taking away

198
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,814
their autonomous control
of their body.

199
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:58,816
We're just causing
them to think

200
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:01,252
they should decide to move
one way or the other.

201
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:04,155
[Tim] Yeah, some people
used to be sort of scared

202
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,890
that we're on
the slippery slope

203
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,259
where I'm gonna control
a whole humanity

204
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,795
with my electrical stimulation,
but you can see that

205
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,530
there's so many other sensory
signals that the cockroach

206
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,131
is receiving,
that we're competing with.

207
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,801
-So, Tim, this was very cool...
-[Tim] Uh-huh.

208
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,169
-a little bit weird.
-[Tim] Uh-huh.

209
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,737
I didn't feel
totally comfortable

210
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,706
controlling
a living organism.

211
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,140
-Uh-huh.
-But there's something here

212
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,109
that's, that's really
important for the future

213
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,978
of understanding brains.

214
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,846
[Tim] Sure,
we use this technology

215
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:32,216
in biomedical applications,
such as cochlear implants,

216
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:34,752
and deep brain stimulation
to treat Parkinson's.

217
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:37,555
But things such as
consciousness and attention

218
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,558
and will are currently
really at the cutting edge

219
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,726
of neuroscience research.

220
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,160
How do you
make decisions?

221
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,829
The wonderful thing
about, uh,

222
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:54,939
neuroscience is
that it's wide open.

223
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,674
[Michael]
 In the very near future,

224
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:59,644
 cyber cockroaches
 could actually save lives.

225
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,712
 Researchers at Texas A&M

226
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:04,048
 and North Carolina
 State University

227
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:06,150
 are developing
 a groundbreaking use

228
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,887
 for robo-roaches in search
 and rescue missions.

229
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,756
 Instead of installing wires

230
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,057
 in the roach's antennae,

231
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,892
 they're implanting receptors

232
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,028
 in the bug's
 actual nervous systems

233
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,797
 to insure
 a longer-term effect.

234
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:22,567
 The plan is to release
 a swarm of robo-roaches

235
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,968
 into a disaster area

236
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,636
 like a collapsed building.

237
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,271
 As the roaches explore,

238
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:30,074
 they'll send images
 and data back to a computer

239
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:32,176
 which creates a detailed 3D map

240
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,211
 of the disaster zone.

241
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,747
 If the cyber-bugs stray
 from the search area,

242
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,615
 their nerves get stimulated

243
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,683
 to steer them back in.

244
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,652
 If a roach detects a survivor,

245
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,254
 a signal is sent back

246
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,723
 with the victim's location.

247
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,259
 While a real world test
 has not been done yet,

248
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,328
 scientists hope to do so

249
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,197
 within the next 10 years.

250
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,899
 Meanwhile, the same technology

251
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,901
 used to cyber-hack cockroaches

252
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:04,709
 can also be used on humans.

253
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,079
Now, Tim,
when I move my arm,

254
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,847
my brain is sending
electrical signals

255
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:12,049
to my muscles
and they respond to that,

256
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,285
and they contract,
and they release.

257
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,855
But you are about
to use a battery

258
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,624
to electrically
stimulate my muscles.

259
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,225
Sure, sure.

260
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,327
[Michael] A human's
 nervous system can be hacked

261
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,696
 with no surgery required.

262
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,965
 Tim attached electrodes
 to my forearm,

263
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,001
 which communicated
 via Bluetooth

264
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,003
 to an app on his iPad.

265
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,871
[Tim] So I'm gonna amplify
the signals

266
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,206
of your muscle activity.

267
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,408
So, every time a neuron
talks to the muscle,

268
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,076
the muscle fires
an electrical impulse

269
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,745
like the neurons.

270
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,647
So we can see
these electrical impulses
right here.

271
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,048
So what I want you to do

272
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,983
-is contract.
-[Michael grunts] Oh, yeah.

273
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,351
[Tim] All right,
so there you go,
you can see the impulses

274
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,420
-occurring in your...
-Watch this.

275
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,888
[Tim] So that whoosh
is the sound

276
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,323
of many muscle
fibers firing...

277
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,091
-[Michael] Many, many.
-firing action potentials

278
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,227
because neurons are synapsing
on those muscles

279
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,928
when you are deciding
to move your body.

280
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,897
Let me passively move
your hand.

281
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,400
We don't see that much activity,
maybe some stretch activity,

282
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,934
but now resist me.

283
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:05,336
-Now there's no movement...
-[Michael] Wow.

284
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:06,904
but we're seeing
electrical activity

285
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,239
because it's due
to contraction.

286
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,340
So what's cool
about this

287
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,708
is that because
you are making

288
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,977
voluntary movements
with your brain,

289
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,913
we can exploit these
muscle contractions

290
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,248
and use it
to control robotics.

291
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,083
[Michael] Okay, so, Tim,
this is all really cool,

292
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:21,118
but the real reason
I invited you here today

293
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,820
and told you to bring
all of this is that

294
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:25,690
I want to control
another human. Alie?

295
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,458
-Hi, Michael.
-Thanks for coming.

296
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,960
So, Alie, you might be
a little apprehensive now

297
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:31,295
after hearing
what I just said, but...

298
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,963
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

299
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:35,299
This is for science,
and it's gonna go both ways.

300
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,368
I'm gonna let you control
my arm as well. You ready?

301
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,136
Okay. Wait, I'm going
first, though?

302
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,772
You're gonna go first,
I think that's important, yes.

303
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,908
-For...
-For randomization.

304
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,342
-[Alie] Okay.
-I flipped a coin earlier

305
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,211
that no one saw,
but it happened.

306
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:50,448
 Alie Ward
 from the Ologies podcast

307
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,116
 was brave enough to let me test

308
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:54,385
 how the brain sends signals
 to the body,

309
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:58,055
 in this case
 my brain sending signals

310
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:00,291
 to move her body.

311
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,959
 And we've placed
 a screen between us

312
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,061
 so she can't see
 when I make a move

313
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,464
 that sends the signal.

314
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,065
All right, let's do it.
So, Michael.

315
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,267
Okay. Should I contract
like softly or firmly?

316
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:11,869
-Just go all the way
 like that, yes.
-All the way?

317
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,138
-Okay, here we go.
-All right.

318
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,107
-Did you feel anything?
-Not yet, no.

319
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,308
-I'm not strong enough.
-Okay, I'm gonna turn it up

320
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,876
-a little bit, okay?
-[Alie] Okay, yeah.

321
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,511
It feels like pins and needles
a little bit.

322
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,046
[Tim] Okay. You're at two.
I'm gonna turn up to four, okay?

323
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,481
-[Alie] All right.
-Okay.

324
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,949
Now contract,
Michael.

325
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,818
Ah!

326
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:30,020
That was really, really,
really weird.

327
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:32,323
-[Tim] Contract.
-Oh, that's really weird.

328
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,191
-[Tim] Okay.
-This is really weird.

329
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,360
Oh, that's-- I'd--
I'm still not over that.

330
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,529
It feels like, uh,
I'm a marionette

331
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,831
and there's just strings
being tugged.

332
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:43,134
[Michael] For the sake
 of science, it was only fair

333
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,370
 that I give Alie a turn
 at the controls.

334
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,805
 But I also wanted to know

335
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,273
 what it was like
 to have someone

336
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:51,208
 control my movements.

337
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,477
All right, now while
Alie controls my body,

338
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:56,113
I thought it would be nice
to maybe enjoy some hot,

339
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:57,848
bright-red tomato soup

340
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,483
and a nice glass
of grape juice.

341
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:02,319
I might even do some writing,
[scoffs] multitasking.

342
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,023
So, um, can we try out
the strength,

343
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,391
uh, just, like, get
a bit of a sense

344
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,793
-of what's gonna happen to me?
-All right.

345
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,027
So, I'll put it
really low at a two.

346
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,195
-[Michael] Good, yeah.
-[Tim] Okay.

347
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:13,197
And, uh, okay,
now contract, Alie.

348
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,832
All right.

349
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,967
-Ah, okay, yup, I felt it.
-Contract again.

350
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:18,169
-I felt...
-Okay. Did you feel that?

351
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,336
-Yes.
-[Tim] All right, now,

352
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:20,971
I'm gonna turn it up
to a four.

353
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:23,107
Okay.

354
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:24,408
All right,
now contract.

355
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:27,111
-You ready?
-Yup.

356
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,914
[laughter]

357
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,115
Wow.

358
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,449
That's, um,

359
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,219
that's not me moving my arm.

360
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,121
Or the rest of your
entire body responds.

361
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:38,989
[Michael] Well-- yeah,
I'm a jumpy person,

362
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,391
so you're gonna get
a lot more out of me.

363
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,294
-Okay.
-[Michael] Now, please

364
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,496
don't control me

365
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:47,998
while I just take a nice,
relaxing sip of...

366
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,135
[Alie chuckles]

367
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,970
[Tim] I'll turn it up
to five and a half.

368
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,573
[Michael] Okay, I'm just
gonna take a nice little,

369
00:12:55,574 --> 00:13:00,611
uh, taste of this soup.

370
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:03,447
This is so mean.
I love it. [chuckles]

371
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:07,184
The meanest part is that
this is very lukewarm soup.

372
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:11,422
All right. Now, just let me
please eat in peace.

373
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,190
-I'm sorry.
-[Michael] All right,

374
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,992
I'm gonna take a break
and write something.

375
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,293
I'll leave you alone,
I'll leave you alone.

376
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:21,265
Okay.

377
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,533
[groans]

378
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:25,002
I'm try--
I can resist it, but...

379
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,104
 Like the cockroaches,
 my body was learning

380
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:30,207
 to adapt to the signal.

381
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:35,079
To science.

382
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:46,657
That's the beauty
of electrophysiology.

383
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,025
Of course the fact that our
neurons

384
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:49,393
work through electricity

385
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,962
means that we can also
record from them,

386
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,431
and that has amazing
medical applications.

387
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:57,301
The electroencephalogram,
or EEG,

388
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,969
came about in the 1920s,

389
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,071
 allowing doctors to see
 some of the brain's

390
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,974
 electrical signals
 as visible brain waves.

391
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,442
 But by the 1980s,

392
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:07,678
scientists realized
that for some tasks,

393
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,914
like the dream of allowing
paralyzed patients

394
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,348
to move a robotic arm,

395
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,317
you need a much richer
brain signal.

396
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,418
 That's because moving an arm

397
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,220
 requires a lot of information.

398
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,255
 You need information
 for how to move your upper arm,

399
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:19,657
 your forearm, your hand,

400
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,026
 your fingers,
 all through 3D space.

401
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,528
EEG just doesn't carry enough
information to do that,

402
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,463
since the electrical signals
it picks up

403
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:28,432
get distorted
after they make their way

404
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,334
through our skull and skin.

405
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,937
So, if you wanted to control
a prosthetic limb

406
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,539
with just your mind,
researchers realized

407
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,076
you'd need to record
directly from the brain.

408
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,344
And in 2006,

409
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,479
scientists finally
did just that.

410
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,181
 They implanted an electrode

411
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,016
 in the brain
 of a paralyzed human

412
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,518
 for the very first time.

413
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,320
 And since that
 first test patient,

414
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,955
 several paralyzed patients

415
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,389
 have received brain implants

416
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,458
 that allow them
 to control robotic arms

417
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,093
 with their minds.

418
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:59,163
 As our understanding
 of the brain grows

419
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,497
 and our computers get better

420
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,633
 at decoding signals
 from the brain,

421
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:05,970
 these patients are gaining
 finer and finer control

422
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,372
 over these robotic arms.

423
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:11,375
 Recently, science has taken
 a big leap forward

424
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:13,243
 from allowing
 paralyzed patients

425
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:15,446
 to control robotic limbs

426
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,382
 to giving them control
 of their own limbs.

427
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,618
 I traveled
 to Ohio State University

428
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:24,555
 to meet one of those patients,
 Ian Burkhart.

429
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,191
 At 19, while vacationing
 with friends,

430
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,326
 Ian dove into a wave
 at the beach

431
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,495
 and broke his neck
 on the sandy floor,

432
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:35,199
 leaving him paralyzed
 from the chest down.

433
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,700
[Ian] I knew as soon as I hit

434
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,135
that I was paralyzed.

435
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,170
And I was floating
face-down in the water

436
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,039
-and could not get up.
-Could you...

437
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,474
[Ian] I couldn't move
anything at all.

438
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,743
 You go from being 19
 and independent,

439
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,012
 living on your own
 in college, to now.

440
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,713
 I need help doing everything

441
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,649
 from eating to going
 to the bathroom,

442
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,219
 sitting up,
 getting into my wheelchair.

443
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,587
 I can move my shoulders
 pretty well,

444
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,022
can move my biceps
that allow me

445
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,156
to move my arms
a little bit,

446
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,058
but nothing
from my biceps down.

447
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,427
[Michael] The doctors
 at Ohio State had approached

448
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:06,530
 Ian about a revolutionary
 experimental treatment

449
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,298
 developed by Battelle,

450
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:09,533
 a research
 and development firm

451
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,235
 using cutting-edge technology

452
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,636
 called NeuroLife.

453
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,538
 They wanted to implant a chip

454
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,206
 in Ian's motor cortex,

455
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,575
 which would allow him
 to move his hand again

456
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:21,812
 while he was connected
 to a computer in the lab.

457
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,681
 I was invited
 to the Wexner Medical Center

458
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,351
 at Ohio State University
 to meet the researchers

459
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:30,154
 and witness this cutting-edge
 work in action.

460
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,823
[Sam] So first we're gonna plug
Ian into the system.

461
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,225
[Ian] The piece, uh, is
protruding from my skull as...

462
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:37,194
-[Michael] Yeah.
-[Ian] ...reference,
 that's the pedestal.

463
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:39,196
It's under
a little protective cap,

464
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:43,067
um, but it's there 24/7
and it leads to some wires

465
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,735
that go to the actual
microchip array

466
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:47,237
that's on the surface
of my brain.

467
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:49,673
[Michael] Pushed into
the actual organ of the brain.

468
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:51,175
[Ian] Exactly.

469
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,509
[Michael]
 The microchip in Ian's head

470
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,811
 detects the blood flow

471
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,180
 and electrical impulses
 of his brain

472
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,248
 that are associated
 with causing movement.

473
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,683
[Sam]
So this is the actual chip.

474
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,185
It sits on the surface
of his brain.

475
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,519
[Michael] Wow.

476
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,221
 Ian's brain is connected
 to software

477
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,289
 that reads and analyzes

478
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,558
 his brain activity.

479
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,860
So this is a live look

480
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,528
at Ian's motor cortex.

481
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,695
[Marcie] Yes.

482
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:15,766
So if you think about
moving your arm,

483
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,468
we should see more activity

484
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,636
-or a different pattern?
-[Ian] Yeah.

485
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:21,538
[Michael]
 At the start of the session,

486
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,341
 in order to calibrate
 the decoder with his brain,

487
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:26,143
 Ian is prompted
 to think about

488
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,479
 moving his hand
 by watching images

489
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,247
 of hand movements.

490
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:32,649
[Ian] You'll see
my computer prompt me

491
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,885
and as it prompts me
to do that,

492
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:36,787
that's what
I'm thinking about.

493
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:38,322
What do you mean
"think about?"

494
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,324
[Ian] Just as much
as I can think about

495
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,693
-imagining that movement.
-Yeah.

496
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,863
 As Ian's brain thinks
 about moving his hand...

497
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,798
-[Sam] Okay, Ian, are you ready?
-Yup.

498
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,533
[Michael]
 ...its electrical signals

499
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,135
 are detected by the chip

500
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,670
 and sent to the decoder.

501
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,139
Then we take
that information

502
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,808
and we associate it
with a hand closed.

503
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,210
So now the decoder
can recognize

504
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:02,312
if he's thinking
that same thing again.

505
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:04,414
[Michael] Next,
 the decoder sends a signal

506
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,316
 to a device that can control

507
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,152
 Ian's muscle movement.

508
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,254
 This special sleeve
 on Ian's arm

509
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,422
 contains a hundred
 and thirty electrodes,

510
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:15,159
 which stimulate the muscles
 in his forearm

511
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,227
 to produce the specific
 movements

512
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,496
 that his brain
 is thinking about,

513
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:21,298
 such as closing his hand

514
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,933
 or moving his thumb.

515
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:26,670
 Now it was time to see Ian
 move his paralyzed hand

516
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,305
 with his thoughts.

517
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,307
[Sam] So, Ian, if you're ready
for this next one...

518
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,909
-[Ian] Yup.
-I'm gonna count you down.

519
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:40,884
Three, two, one.

520
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,186
[Michael] Whoa.

521
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,489
[Marcie] So,
that was the decoder.

522
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,690
Decoding his thoughts?

523
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,325
-Decoding his thoughts.
-[Michael] Wow.

524
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:50,561
[Marcie] Ian was in control
of the movements.

525
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,329
[Michael] Nice work.

526
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,264
 Already, Ian's achievements

527
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:56,900
 go far beyond
 closing his hand.

528
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,236
 With the help of this
 cutting-edge technology,

529
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:01,371
 he can use
 his own paralyzed hand

530
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:03,373
 to do a number
 of fine motor tasks

531
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:06,210
 from everyday movements

532
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,845
 to playing Guitar Hero.

533
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:10,914
How many other people
are like Ian?

534
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:13,317
Currently in the world,

535
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,552
maybe five?

536
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:18,789
[Michael] Ian continues
 to gain more independence

537
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,725
 outside the lab, as well.

538
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,660
Do people
ever drive with you

539
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,662
and get nervous like,
"Oh, my gosh,

540
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,497
well, clearly
this is dangerous."

541
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:29,399
[Ian] I think
if everyone else

542
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,767
that was driving
along in the road knew

543
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,936
I have no use of my hands

544
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:34,471
going 70 miles an hour
down the freeway,

545
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:35,872
they may not like that.

546
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:37,407
But they've-- they have
nothing to worry about.

547
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:38,875
[Ian] Right, yeah,
and I'm probably safer

548
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:41,011
because I can't take
my hands off the wheel

549
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,380
-to get on my cell phone and...
-Right. Yup.

550
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,249
You're not fiddling
with the radio and...

551
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,284
Yeah, that I shouldn't be
doing while I'm driving.

552
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:50,320
 [Michael] Ian's progress
 was truly inspiring,

553
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,556
 and this was only
 the beginning for him.

554
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:56,393
What are your hopes
for the future for yourself?

555
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:59,296
[Ian] Hopefully,
I can upgrade

556
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:01,765
to the next version
and, you know,

557
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:03,033
have more capabilities

558
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:05,902
and be able to do things
a lot easier.

559
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,372
 In the long term, I hope
 that this can be a device

560
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,040
 that people just use.

561
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,276
 You have someone
 who has a spinal cord injury

562
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,610
 and they can just continue

563
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,279
 right where they left off.

564
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,514
I think, you know,
the work that we're doing

565
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:20,651
is something that has
never been done before

566
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:31,361
and it's really exciting to be
on that cutting edge.

567
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:33,463
Restoring movement
is one thing,

568
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:35,732
but what about feeling,

569
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,301
sensation?

570
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,536
We feel with our skin
because of signals

571
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:42,806
sent to the somatosensory
cortex of our brain.

572
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:45,709
By putting sensors
in robotic fingers

573
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,477
connected to implants
in a person's

574
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:48,979
somatosensory cortex,

575
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,981
researchers
at the University of Pittsburgh

576
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,916
have enabled Nathan Copeland

577
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:57,688
to feel
through a robotic hand.

578
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,756
 Nathan underwent
 brain surgery

579
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,491
 to receive two implants,

580
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:02,926
 one in his motor cortex

581
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,795
 to control a robotic arm

582
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:05,929
 and a second implant

583
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,598
 over his somatosensory cortex.

584
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,800
 This second implant

585
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,568
 stimulates his brain

586
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,603
 and the pattern
 of stimulation depends

587
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:15,639
 on what part
 of the robot hand is touched.

588
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,575
 So, if you touch the robot
 on a specific finger,

589
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:21,578
 then the part of Nathan's
 somatosensory cortex

590
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,814
 that normally responds
 to that finger

591
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,849
 get stimulated.

592
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,951
[Nathan] Pinky.

593
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,753
Uh, middle.

594
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:33,056
[Michael] His brain interprets
 that as touch.

595
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:35,926
 Nathan and Ian's
 remarkable achievements

596
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,694
 have been aided
 by their ability

597
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:39,996
 to communicate
 with the researchers involved.

598
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:41,865
 But what can be done
 for people

599
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,935
 who are not only
 unable to move,

600
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,404
 but also unable to speak?

601
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:49,539
 Steve Kaplan was an active

602
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,776
 57-year-old computer programmer
 dating Laurie,

603
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:55,078
 a horse wrangler
 for the rodeo.

604
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,080
 But that all changed
 a year ago

605
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:59,049
 when he suffered
 a massive stroke

606
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,451
 leaving him
 in a vegetative state,

607
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:03,687
 unable to move or speak.

608
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,623
 Doctors initially declared
 Steve brain dead.

609
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,558
 However, inside his body

610
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,826
 he was fully conscious,

611
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,962
 but unable to tell them so.

612
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,864
 It wasn't
 until a nurse noticed

613
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,600
 that Steve's eye movements
 were intentional

614
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,736
 that he was diagnosed
 with locked-in syndrome,

615
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:21,972
 a condition which robs
 people of everything

616
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,707
 but their mind.

617
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,576
 While a normal brain
 receives electrical signals

618
00:22:26,577 --> 00:22:29,045
 from the senses and sends
 signals back to them,

619
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:31,581
 the stroke prevented
 the electrical signals

620
00:22:31,582 --> 00:22:34,184
 from leaving Steve's brain.

621
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:35,986
 Over the last year,

622
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,988
 with the help
 of physical therapists,

623
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,856
 Steve has regained
 some very minor

624
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,125
 range of motion in his neck.

625
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:45,662
 I sat down with Steve
 and his now-wife Laurie

626
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:47,964
 to learn more about
 locked-in syndrome.

627
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,767
Steve, Laurie, hello.

628
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,936
 Although he's still
 unable to speak,

629
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:54,938
 thanks to new scientific
 developments,

630
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:57,207
 Steve can communicate
 with the outside world

631
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,909
 using a computer.

632
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,677
[computer male voice]
 Hello, Michael.

633
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:01,678
[Michael]
Nice to meet you, Steve.

634
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,746
And nice
to meet you, Laurie.

635
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:03,914
First of all,
thank you so much

636
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,515
for giving us some time.

637
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:08,452
Tell me how Steve started
being able to communicate.

638
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,554
[Laurie] Well, you know,
I asked a lot of questions

639
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,755
about locked-in syndrome

640
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,056
when they explained
what it was,

641
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,058
and there wasn't
a lot of answers.

642
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,660
-Yeah.
-[Laurie] At the beginning,

643
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,796
he would blink once for yes
and twice for no.

644
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:22,866
 And that was the first parts
 of the communication.

645
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,534
 And then they
 gave us a board,

646
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,236
 and I went
 through the ABCs,

647
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:27,737
 and he would close his eyes

648
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:28,839
 when I got to what he wanted.

649
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,973
 I'd write it down,

650
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,508
 and that's how it began.

651
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,109
[Michael] As you could imagine,

652
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,679
 Laurie and Steve's
 first method of communicating

653
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,915
 was a slow
 and painstaking process.

654
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,817
 But just months later,

655
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:42,519
 an engineer working to help

656
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,720
 locked-in patients

657
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:44,955
 built Steve a machine

658
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,923
 that tracks his eye movements.

659
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:49,993
 As Steve looks at different
 letters on a screen,

660
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:52,529
 the machine translates
 where he's looking

661
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,664
 into synthesized
 audible speech.

662
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,533
[computer male voice]
 I want to recover.

663
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:59,102
[Michael] Although
 there's still a slight delay

664
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:01,037
 in communication
 as Steve scans

665
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:02,706
 the letters on the screen,

666
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,541
 this method is much more fluid

667
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:10,113
 and significantly faster.

668
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:12,516
The computer helps me
communicate

669
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,618
[Michael] Yeah.
You can write with your eyes.

670
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,819
[Laurie]
This thing's amazing.

671
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,021
He can email,
he can text,

672
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:19,523
call me
if he needs something.

673
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,857
It's such a relief.

674
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:21,925
[computer male voice]
 It does wonders.

675
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:23,593
[Michael]
It does wonders, yes.

676
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:24,794
-Uh-hmm, [chuckles]
-[Michael] And I could only

677
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,696
imagine how emotional
it would have been

678
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:29,132
to you to be able to look
and write a thing,

679
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,600
and then have it spoken.

680
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:33,036
And, Laurie,
for you to hear

681
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:35,906
words coming from his mind,
from his heart,

682
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,607
especially
for the first time

683
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:39,175
-in a long time.
-[Laurie] Yes.

684
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:47,584
What was the first thing
you said, Steve?

685
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,586
[computer male voice] The first
 message was happy birthday.

686
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,855
[laughter]

687
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,056
What a birthday present.

688
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:54,858
[Laurie laughs]
It really was.

689
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:57,160
[Michael] Steve's progress
 is remarkable,

690
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,895
 and it would be
 difficult to deny

691
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:01,197
 the connection between
 his new ability to communicate

692
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:02,933
 and connect
 with the outside world

693
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,634
 with the incredible advances

694
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:06,970
 he's made physically
 over the last year.

695
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,039
-Look up at the ceiling.
-[Michael] Yeah.

696
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,008
-Look down at your thumbs.
-[clears throat]

697
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:13,944
Look over at me,
your beautiful wife.

698
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,712
[laughter]

699
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:17,881
[Michael] Laurie and Steve
 hope that one day

700
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:19,349
 Steve will make
 a full recovery

701
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:26,656
 from locked-in syndrome.

702
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:29,626
Steve's eye-tracking device
is electric,

703
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,027
and so is his brain.

704
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,629
They're connected by the fact

705
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,631
that Steve can move his eyes.

706
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,199
But some locked-in patients

707
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,969
can't even control
their eye movements.

708
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,203
They have what is known

709
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:43,773
as completely
locked-in syndrome.

710
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:46,242
For these patients,
the eye-tracking technology

711
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:49,279
that helped Steve communicate
is useless.

712
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,781
 But researchers in Europe
 recently found a way

713
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:53,984
 of allowing completely
 locked-in patients

714
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:57,387
 to communicate
 using just their thoughts.

715
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,656
 The researchers combined EEG

716
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:02,325
 with near-infrared
 spectroscopy,

717
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:03,927
 which can non-invasively

718
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:06,096
 measure blood flow
 in the brain.

719
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,230
The patients were asked

720
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:08,932
simple yes or no questions

721
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:10,900
that the researchers
knew the answers to,

722
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:13,770
which allowed them
to train a machine to recognize

723
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,939
which brain signals meant yes

724
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,274
and which brain signals
meant no.

725
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,343
The researchers
then asked the patients

726
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:21,845
a new set of questions

727
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:22,979
they knew the answer to,

728
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,414
and using just their thoughts,

729
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:26,149
 the patients were able to give

730
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,786
 the correct answers
 to 70% of the questions.

731
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:32,288
Now, giving just
yes or no answers

732
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:33,423
may be limited,

733
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,158
but this technology is new.

734
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,927
All of this happened
just this year.

735
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,829
 These rapid advancements,

736
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,233
 thanks to the devotion
 and effort of researchers

737
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,901
 and subjects around the world,

738
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:46,736
 are slowly but surely

739
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:49,739
 chipping away
 at the mysteries of the mind.

740
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,274
The better
we understand the mind,

741
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:52,809
the better
we'll be able to help

742
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,444
the millions of people
who struggle to do

743
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:56,813
what they want
because of psychological

744
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,448
or neurological conditions,

745
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:03,019
and ultimately the better
we'll understand ourselves.

746
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,888
And as always,

747
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,191
thanks for watching.
