This is completely up to you,
but we can move to level two,

176
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,878
which is slightly
more intense.

177
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,114
- How many more levels
are there?

178
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,882
- Uh, there's just five.

179
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,584
- There's five levels?
- There are five.

180
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:07,685
- Oh, my gosh.
- But again,

181
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,554
you're in the driver's seat.

182
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:13,090
- Uh, yeah, sure. Let's do it.
[chuckles]

183
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,326
 - Here's another test
 of our nocebo.

184
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:18,095
 Will she feel an increase
 in her level of pain

185
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,197
 if she expects to?
 - You ready?

186
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,667
- Mm-hmm.
[machine humming]

187
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,002
 - Keep in mind,
 level two is fake.

188
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,204
 We're not doing anything
 different than before,

189
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,574
 meaning nothing
 is happening to her.

190
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,009
- So, yeah, it started off
higher

191
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,644
than the last time,
I think.

192
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:37,981
It's definitely, like,
already stinging.

193
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:41,185
 - Immediately, she reports
 increased pain on level two.

194
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:42,620
It's 15 seconds.

195
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,989
- It feels really, really,
really hot and,

196
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,190
like, penetrating.

197
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,359
- How deep?
- Um...

198
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,727
- 30 seconds.
- I don't know, like,

199
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:51,696
1/2 and inch or, like,
an inch.

200
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:56,033
Yeah, it is...
it's very hot.

201
00:08:56,034 --> 00:09:00,371
Um, like burning.

202
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:05,710
Like my whole arm is, like,
on fire.

203
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,845
- We can stop at any time.
- You want to call it?

204
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:11,716
- Yeah.
- Okay, we're off.

205
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,718
- Do you need a tissue?
- Yeah, thank you.

206
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,886
- You're welcome.
- [sniffs]

207
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:20,024
- Could you rank for me
how you felt at level two?

208
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,993
- Like 9 1/2.

209
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,862
 - The power of suggestion
 was so strong,

210
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:27,064
 our nocebo caused our subject
 to think

211
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:30,735
 she felt almost the worst pain
 imaginable.

212
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,038
 Other subject felt different
 imaginary sensations.

213
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,040
- The muscles are kind of, uh,

214
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,975
kind of burning
a little bit.

215
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:41,012
- Stop.
- How did that feel?

216
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,047
- That was, like, a seven.

217
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,082
Actually it's tingling
a lot more now

218
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,351
than it was before.

219
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,887
 - I was surprised
 at the intense reaction

220
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,156
 some subjects had to a feeling
 that was created

221
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:54,125
 only in their minds.

222
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:58,295
- Look, I'm gonna stop it now.
That was 45 seconds.

223
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:01,799
Describe for me the sensations
that you were having.

224
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,034
- It felt like
a little prickle

225
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,303
like when you get
goose bumps.

226
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,305
 - What about our original
 subject

227
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:11,976
 who experienced a severe
 9 1/2 on the pain scale?

228
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:15,012
 How will she feel when she
 learns it was all in her head?

229
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,914
I want to debrief you
on everything

230
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,149
that we're up to today.

231
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,318
So this is
a psychology program,

232
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:24,889
and this equipment is not
doing anything to you.

233
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,158
This is just a machine
that makes noise.

234
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,927
And that's just a laser pointer
on a lamp.

235
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,395
- For real?
- For real.

236
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:33,798
- Oh, my God. [laughing]
- You were never in danger.

237
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,466
- We didn't do anything to you.
- Oh, my God.

238
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:39,203
- This is an investigation
in pain anticipation.

239
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:42,339
- Yeah, that worked.
- I was so scared. [laughing]

240
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,775
I was so close to, like,
going to, like,

241
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,310
just say, "You know what?
I changed my mind."

242
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,179
I was so close to leaving.

243
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,981
- You did say that you felt
a prickle.

244
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,184
- Uh-huh.
- How do you feel about that?

245
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,252
- Whether it was really
I did get goose bumps

246
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,388
or I was nervous,
which is why I felt it.

247
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,356
I know, as a person, like,

248
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,025
if I think there's going
to be pain,

249
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,159
I'm gonna feel something.

250
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,961
- I do still feel, like,
kind of like

251
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,362
a burning sensation
on my arms.

252
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:06,997
- Really?
- Yeah.

253
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:09,233
 - The power of suggestion
 is so strong

254
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:12,837
 that this subject continued to
 imagine a physical sensation,

255
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,972
 even after learning
 it wasn't real.

256
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:18,275
The name for the effect
is the nocebo effect.

257
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:21,846
It's a negative effect caused
by nothing but the mind.

258
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,481
- It makes perfect sense,
you know,

259
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,182
the power of suggestion.

260
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:34,225
I'm shaky just thinking
about it.

261
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,795
- Pain and touch are weird.

262
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,331
But what about when touch
straddles the line

263
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,867
between pleasure and pain?

264
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,002
When a sensation
makes you laugh

265
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,037
and drives you crazy.

266
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,006
I'm talking about tickling.

267
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,108
 Part of what makes you laugh
 when you're tickled

268
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,843
 is the element of surprise.

269
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:55,112
 Your brain doesn't know
 exactly what to expect

270
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:56,480
 or when it's going to happen.

271
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:59,083
 On the other hand,
 it's impossible

272
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:00,851
 to tickle yourself.

273
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:03,821
 If the brain knows
 where and when and how

274
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:06,891
 you are going to be touched,
 you won't laugh.

275
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,059
But professors of cognitive
neuroscience

276
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,928
at the University College
London

277
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:14,198
have invented
the tickle machine.

278
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,300
 Subjects sit in
 the tickle machine

279
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,968
 with their feet against
 a brush

280
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,503
 that is connected
 to a handle.

281
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:22,006
 At first, when the subjects
 turn the handle,

282
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,475
 the brush rotates
 at the exact same time

283
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,443
 resulting in no tickling.

284
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:29,380
 Then the machine is switched
 into tickle mode...

285
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,816
- [laughing] 
 -  Which causes a delay

286
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,484
 of less than a second
 between when the subject

287
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,486
 turns the handle
 and when the brush moves

288
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:36,954
 against their foot.

289
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:39,423
- [laughing]
 - This slight change

290
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,091
 is enough to prevent
 the brain's cerebellum

291
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,960
 from predicting
 the sensation,

292
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:45,963
 thus allowing the subject
 to respond to the tickle.

293
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:47,965
- [laughing]

294
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,366
- Tickles can be fun.

295
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,369
Pain, not so much.

296
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,473
If you couldn't feel pain,
that would be great, right?

297
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,175
Or would it?

298
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,111
Let's meet Steve Pete.

299
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,480
Steve, I understand
you don't feel pain.

300
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,482
- Yes, I was born
with a rare genetic condition

301
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:08,252
called congenital insensitivity
to pain.

302
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,988
It only affects about 40 to 50
of us around the world with it.

303
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:12,456
- Only 40 or 50 people?
- Yeah.

304
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,258
So far that we've been able
to find.

305
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,027
- And tell me what it means when
you say you don't feel pain.

306
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:19,496
- Pain is used
to detect injury

307
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,365
and it kind of sends a signal
to your brain saying,

308
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,868
"Hey, don't do this anymore."
It's an alarm system.

309
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,136
So what happens
with my condition is

310
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:27,571
we feel what's going on

311
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,440
like if I were to touch
your shoulder,

312
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,041
you would feel me
touching your shoulder,

313
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,043
but if I were to touch
your shoulder in a way

314
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:36,046
that's painful,
I would feel just a pressure,

315
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:39,149
and the signal of pain
would not travel to my brain.

316
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,285
- Okay, so you feel everything--
- Everything else.

317
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:44,455
that I feel,
but you just don't feel pain.

318
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,423
- Yeah. Correct.
- But that could be dangerous.

319
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,393
How did you first find out
that you had this condition?

320
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,362
- Well, what happened was
I was teething

321
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,064
and I chewed
part of my tongue off.

322
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,400
 So my parents quickly took me
 to my pediatrician.

323
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,936
- Wow. Are you ticklish?
- Yes.

324
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:00,104
- Do you itch?
- Yes.

325
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,572
- Do you like massages?
- Yes.

326
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,540
- Do you take painkillers?
- No.

327
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,309
- What about a headache?
- No.

328
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,946
- What about spicy peppers?
- I enjoy them, yeah.

329
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,982
I mean, I do sense
the burning sensation,

330
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,217
but nothing painful.

331
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:17,221
- What about intestine pain
like gas pain?

332
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,656
- That's something
I don't feel,

333
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,359
so that kind of ties into
one of my biggest fears,

334
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,194
which is having, like,
appendicitis

335
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,196
or any other type
of internal damage

336
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:28,465
that I just don't know about
until it's too late.

337
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,967
- Is there an upside to this?

338
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,502
I'm sure that people,
often naively,

339
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,970
hear that you don't feel pain...
- Yeah.

340
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:34,071
- And they think,
"Oh, man.

341
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,272
Well, you should become
a boxer."

342
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,308
- The only upside to it is,
uh,

343
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,044
 being that I have had so many
 injuries during my childhood,

344
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,546
 as I get older, I won't feel
 the pain that comes with it.

345
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,114
 Other than that, really,

346
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,683
 I just try to live
 my life normally

347
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,184
 as everyone else does.

348
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,453
- I cannot describe
pain to you.

349
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:52,323
Just like you can't describe
a color to someone who's blind.

350
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,091
- Which is where I run into
my problem

351
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,694
with trying to describe
what not feeling pain is like.

352
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,595
- Wow, I'll bet.

353
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,064
Well, Steve,
thank you very much.

354
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:04,335
This was really,
really fascinating.

355
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:09,606
 So not being able to feel pain
 is actually a bad thing.

356
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:13,444
But likewise, the anticipation
of pain can be bad too.

357
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:17,514
Just making someone think
that they might be tortured soon

358
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,483
could be a torture device.

359
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:22,086
 The CIA and Guantanamo Bay
 are known

360
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,254
 for using
 psychological torture

361
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:26,724
 involving the anticipation
 of pain

362
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,260
 against prisoners
 in the war on terror.

363
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:34,999
The effects of this type
of torture can last a lifetime.

364
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
So what's worse?

365
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:41,605
Waiting for pain to happen
or the pain itself?

366
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:46,677
You might be surprised.

367
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,679
 We're basing our investigation

368
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,281
 on an anticipation of pain
 experiment,

369
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:54,284
 conducted at the
 University College London,

370
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:56,286
 which gave subject
 two options.

371
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:59,757
 Option one: Experience
 intense pain right away.

372
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:04,161
 Or option two: Anticipate
 a lower level of pain

373
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,163
 in intervals
 every few minutes.

374
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:09,433
 Researchers found that the
 psychological effects of dread

375
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:14,171
 can often be worse
 than the pain itself.

376
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:16,373
 We decided to demonstrate
 the phenomenon

377
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,642
 by setting up
 a fake research study.

378
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:21,178
We are looking into

379
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,180
the effects of electrical
stimulation on the body.

380
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,582
- Okay.
- It's all completely harmless.

381
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,584
But it can be unpleasant.
- Right.

382
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:29,420
- So we'll show you
the two settings, all right?

383
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,623
I want to show you first what we
call the light setting, okay?

384
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,159
- Okay.
- You ready?

385
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,627
- I guess so.

386
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,362
[buzzing]
Oh.

387
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,164
- And then there's
the high setting.

388
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,299
[buzzing]
- Ow.

389
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,368
- Okay.
- I don't--[laughing]

390
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:47,471
- All right, so again,
unpleasant definitely...

391
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,806
- Yeah.
- But you're safe.

392
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,442
We call this the low voltage
or light shock.

393
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,643
- Okay.
- Ready?

394
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,079
- All right.

395
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,181
[buzzing]
Hmm, okay.

396
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,851
- And now we'll show you the
high voltage or higher shock.

397
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,619
- Oh, okay.

398
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,320
[buzzing]
Ooh.

399
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:06,190
- Okay.
- Okay.

400
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,723
 - Now it's time
 for our subjects

401
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,393
 to make an important choice.

402
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,795
All right, so now that you know
the two differences,

403
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:14,698
you either can choose
choice A,

404
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,702
which is one high voltage shock
every ten seconds for a minute.

405
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,137
- Mm-hmm.
 - Will our subjects choose

406
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:23,173
 the higher,
 more painful shocks,

407
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:25,209
 but get it over with
 right away?

408
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:30,347
Or choice B
is one low voltage shock

409
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:33,450
every ten minutes
for one hour.

410
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:36,253
 Or will they choose
 the lower shocks,

411
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:39,156
 but be forced to anticipate
 the pain for ten minutes

412
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,692
 between shocks
 for a solid hour?

413
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,862
Either way,
you will be here for an hour.

414
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,664
 What's worse?
 A higher level of pain?

415
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,733
 Or having to wait
 and anticipate

416
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,301
 the lower level of pain?

417
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,503
- I'll take the long.

418
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,339
- I think I'll do the shorter,

419
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,374
uh, more painful one.

420
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,775
- Okay.

421
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,644
 Now that they've made
 their choices,

422
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,346
 it's time to see how
 our subjects

423
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,215
 experience these two options?

424
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:07,317

 to anticipate

 who are pretending
 to get shocked.

429
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:20,564
- Hi.

430
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:24,268
 - This subject's hour-long
 ordeal is just beginning.

431
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,570
 But what about the subject
 who chose to get it over with

432
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:29,673
 and take the more painful
 shocks right away?

433
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:32,743

439
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,891
- Shock number three.
[buzzing]

440
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,927
- It's half over.
 - Exactly.

 getting it over with quickly.

00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,464

 the subject has plenty of time
 for the pain

451
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,291

 to occupy his mind.

- Oh, okay.
 - Finally, his hour is up.

455
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:33,737
Tell me about why you chose
the lower voltage choice.

456
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:36,807
- I guess you're--
less pain, you know.

 It's so quiet in there,

461
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,483
 so basically you got
 your thoughts.

462
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:48,852
 Your thoughts is like,
 "Okay, it's coming."

463
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,655
 - This anxiety may be the
 reason why

464
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:54,625
 in the original study,
 a full 70% of subjects

465
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,828
 opted to receive the more
 painful shocks right away,

466
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,297
 rather than suffer through
 the mental torture

467
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,898
 of anticipation.

468
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:05,369
Why did you choose
the higher shock group?

469
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,338
- Just knowing that it was over
within a minute,

470
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,707
 I think ten seconds
 is easier to go along with

471

 what was coming next.
