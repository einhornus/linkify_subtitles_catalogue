Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And are you still
doing things in the real world? C'mon, I mean,

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:14,899
why flip a coin when you could justflipacoin.com?
Every time you refresh the page, it flips

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,289
again. Of course, there are plenty of other
things you can Do Online Now, Guys.

00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:27,509
For instance, have you ever wondered "Am I
Awesome?" Well, ask the Internet.
Go to amiawesome.com -

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,269
it never lies. Earn your awesomeness like
Monstewn by playing The Wiki Game against

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,999
opponents from all over the world. Here I
am clicking links to race from the U.S. Constitution

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,209
to South India. I had a rough patch there
in the middle, but I got by in a squeaker.

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,289
The constellations in the sky have looked
the way they do since the ancient people gave

9
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:57,499
them names, but they are still fleeting because
our Earth moves, and the solar system moves,

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:04,988
and the galaxy is moving all through space,
they won't always look the same. This website

11
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:10,869
shows you what will happen to them in the
future. For instance, 70,000 years from today,

12
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,959
standing on Earth, the Big Dipper will look like this.

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,139
If Cosmonauts explore the cosmos, and you
explore the Internet, that makes your an Internaught

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,119

be shaking its head at you.

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,519
In Pyro, you aim flaming balls to start fires
and burn things. But to test your wits, try

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,769
The Impossible Quiz. Multiple choice questions
that make you think "can a match box?" "No,

18
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,839
but a tin can."

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,699
The Amaster15 pointed me towards this incredible
depository of giant images. Like, really,

20
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,299
really giant.

21
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,499
Following the rules is safe and easy, for
instance, "deliver." Ok, done. But, when a

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,469
level says "disobey,"don't do what is says.

23
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,639
AuzzieZiggy recommends Motherload where you
play as a machine that can burrow but also

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,259
jump pretty well. Make money collecting rock
to upgrade and don't forget to refuel.

25
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,539
Stealing the Diamond lets you make choices
and see how they pan out. Be careful and

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,159
creative.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,979
For a string of bizarre clips, thebest404pageever.com
always offers a pleasant surprise.

28
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:49,939
But take a break and relax with 2playstationnetwork
and play in the sand, because thisissand.com.

29
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,878
And oh, look, Amy Poehler has a channel on
YouTube with lots of different kinds of stuff,

30
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,059
including her answering your questions while
she lies on a bed or sits in a shower. It's

31
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,488
for Smart Girls, but yes,
there is a weekly Boy Minute.

32
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:12,169
TheChelengo asks you to test out passwords
at howsecureismypassword.net. The site estimates

33
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,649
and displays how quickly a PC could guess
your password. Does that make you nervous?

34
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:24,109
Well, Hissandpixels is here to calm you down
with thenicestplaceontheinter.net. It's nothing

35
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,809
but a never-ending parade of fullscreen videos
of people hugging you.

36
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,839
Writer's block? Well be like techonyoursix
and generate yourself some plots. This site

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,599
randomly creates scenarios to get you thinking.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,568
RangerForceful recommends Last Square Standing,
which is super simple but gets tough quick.

39
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,928
Avoid touching anything for as long as you can.

40
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:55,339
Pointer Pointer watches your pointer and then
pulls a photo from its giant reservoir in

41
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,379
which someone points to where your pointer is.

42
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:08,979
Finally, SirFatSug asked hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com.

43
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,519
Phew, ok, it looks like we're good for now,
but let's periodically check on this to make

44
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,679
sure the world is still together and if it
is, or even if it isn't...

45
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,908
As always,

46
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,189
thanks for watching.
