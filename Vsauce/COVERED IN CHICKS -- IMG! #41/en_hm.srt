1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,689
A rooster...cat?
And Ronald orders a number three.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,139
It's episode 41 of IMG!

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,879
City life.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,159
Oh hi.
And here's a necktie that's formal

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,379
and manly, though, of course,
I prefer one piece

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,829
cat faces. Too much coverage?
Well, try on one of these

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,118
or just wear a slice of bread on your face. It's

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,409
almost as good as squishing it up against bars.

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,279
Hayashi Natsumi takes photos of herself relaxing

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:48,099
mid-jump.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,389
Tug on a blowhole

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,179
with this whale tissue holder and the
movie poster for The Dark Knight Rises

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,419
contains an awesome

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,238
hidden bat shape,
but some people see a jumping unicorn.

15
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,169
Here kid, have a sparkler.
I mean, say cheese.

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,289
Doh. The baby's okay,
so take your dog for a walk

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,719
skate and then put a price sticker on Moby
Dick just right

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,949
and you get... 
Wow, okay, look, let's just get some knowledge.

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,059
In Canada, postal codes are alphanumeric.
And in British Columbia

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,999
you can visit V4G1N4.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,329
Alright, let's be more mature.
Every year during the wet season, Lake Titicaca

22
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,659
overflows into lake PoopÃ³, which in
turn overflows into Salar de Uyuni,

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,549
the world's largest salt bed.
It is so big

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,049
it contains 70 percent of our world's lithium reserves

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,269
and it's so flat that orbiting
satellites use it

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,939
to determine the steadiness of their altitudes.
When it rains,

27
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,389
Salar de Uyuni becomes the world's
largest mirror.

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,458
But if that's too much water for you,
you don't have to travel very far to get to

29
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,129
Antofagasta Region of the Atacama
Desert, the driest

30
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,109
place on Earth. On average,
the entire desert only receives one

31
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,219
millimeter of rain each year. And some
weather stations out there have yet

32
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,229
in human history to have recorded
rainfall. In fact, between 1570

33
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,899
and 1971 it is estimated that no significant water

34
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,269
fell there at all.
It's so near sterile

35
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,649
NASA uses the region to test Mars rovers
and in some areas of the desert

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,999
those rovers found not a single trace

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,369
of life.
On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming

38
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,458
Panagiotis showed that with the right
clouds the Sun

39
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,848
could become a smiley face.
He also showed off an inquisitive

40
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,068
beard and Tim Ryan helped out.
Okay.

41
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,568
I'll go left and then I'll go... wait.

42
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:47,688
I'm just gonna lay around with some chicks.

43
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,028
And as always,

44
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,549
thanks for watching.
