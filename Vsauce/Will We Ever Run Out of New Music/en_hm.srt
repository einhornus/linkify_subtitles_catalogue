1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:08,839
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And the iTunes store contains 28 million different songs.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,739
Last.fm carries 45 million songs and the
Gracenote database of artists, titles, and

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:24,239
labels contains 130 million different songs.
That's a lot. If you were to listen to all

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,649
of the songs in the Gracenote database one
after the other in a giant playlist, it would

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,759
take you more than 1,200 years to complete.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,578
But since there are a finite number of tones
our ears can distinguish and because it only

7
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:48,699
takes a few notes in common for two musical
ideas to sound similar, will we ever run out

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,999
of new music?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,939
Will there ever be a day where every possible
brief little melody has been written and recorded

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,179
and we are left with nothing new to make?

11
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,599
A good rule of thumb might be to say that
if modern recording technology can't distinguish

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,059
the difference between two songs, well, neither
could we. So, let's begin there, with digital

13
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,059
downloads, MP3's, CD's, and a calculation
made by Covered in Bees.

14
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,438
Digital music is made out of "bits."
Lots and lots of bits. But each individual bit

15
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,719
exists in one of two states: a "0" or a "1."

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,438
Now, what this means in that for any given,
say, 5-minute-long audio file, the number

17
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:43,298
of possibilities, mathematically speaking,
is enormous, but mind-blowingly finite.

18
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:51,429
A compact disk, which samples music at 44.1
kHz, is going to need about 211 million bits

19
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,258
to store one 5-minute song. And because a
bit can exist in two states, either a "0"

20
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:03,609
or a "1," the number of possible different
ways to arrange those 211,000,000 bits is

21
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,929
2 to the 211th million power.

22
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:14,179
That value represents every single possible
different 5-minute-long audio file. But how

23
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,389
big is that number?
Well, let's put this in perspective.

24
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:29,919
A single drop of water contains 6 sextillion
atoms. 6 sextillion is 22 digits long. That's

25
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,089
a long number. But the total number of atoms
that make up the entire earth is a number

26
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,949
that is about 50 digits long. And estimations
of the total number of hydrogen atoms in our

27
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,569
universe is a number that is 80 digits long.

28
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,479
But "2 to the 211 millionth power," the number
of possible, different 5-minute audio files, is a number

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:07,999
that is 63 million digits long. It is a number
larger than we can even pretend to understand.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,629
It contains every possible CD quality 5-minute
audio file. Inside that amount is everything

31
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:20,319
from Beethoven's "5th" to Beck's "Loser" -
it even contains a 5 minute conversation you

32
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,969
had with your parents when you were 3 years old.
In fact, every one of them. It even contains

33
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,419
every possible conversation you didn't have
with your parents when you were 3 years old.

34
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:38,509
But, it is finite, not infinite. It's cool
to think about, but it doesn't come very close

35
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,349
to answering the question of this video, which
is "how many possible different songs can

36
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,229
we create and hear the difference between?"

37
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,509
So, for that, we're going to need to narrow
down our hunt.

38
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,099
On Everything2, Ferrouslepidoptera made a
calculation that involved some assumptions

39
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,019
that I think helped narrow the field down
in a really nice way.

40
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,309
She took a look at the total number of possible
different melodies you could create within

41
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:15,009
one octave, containing any or all of the intervals
we divide octaves into. Of course, sound frequencies

42
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,569
can be divided much more granularly than that,
but giving ourselves more notes might mean

43
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,519
we could make more technically different melodies,
but they wouldn't necessarily sound any different

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,259
to our ears.

45
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,539
Now, given a single measure containing any
combination of whole, half, quarter, eighth,

46
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:39,759
sixteenth or thirty-second notes, she calculated
that there would be this many possible unique

47
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,689
measures, which is a smaller number than we
had before, but, to put it in perspective,

48
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:52,729
this is how many seconds old the universe is.

49
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:59,039
Yerricde's calculation is even more specific.
He stayed within one octave, but instead of

50
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,189
looking at a complete measure, he only considered
the number of unique combinations of 8 notes.

51
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,209
He also assumed that typical melodies, as
we know them today, only contain about three

52
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,769
different types of note length. For instance, quarter, eighth and sixteenth or whole,

53
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,179
half and quarter.

54
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,499
To be sure, that will most likely not always
be true. Musical tastes hundreds, thousands

55
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,359
of years from now will most assuredly be different,
but given melodies as we know them today,

56
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:41,899
across 8 notes, over 12 intervals, there are
about 79 billion possible combinations.

57
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,079
We're getting relatively small here. I mean,
under this definition of melody, 100 songwriters

58
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,089
creating a brand new 8-note melody every second
would exhaust every possible melody within

59
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,919
only 248 years.

60
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,979
But it's still a huge number, way bigger than
the total number of songs that have been written

61
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,939
that we know about. So, you can quite safely
say that, no, we will never run out of new

62
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:18,479
music. But here's the rub. If that's the case,
why are there so many commonalities between

63
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,879
songs? Even across hundreds of years, how
come so many songs kind of sound the same?

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,909
I mean, if we have more possibilities than
we could ever exhaust, why is "Twinkle Twinkle

65
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:35,169
Little Star," the "Alphabet Song," and "Baa,
Baa, Black Sheep," all the same melody?

66
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,169
"My Country Tis of Thee," and "God Save the
Queen," interestingly enough, are the same

67
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,159
song.

68
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:57,439
"Love Me Tender," is exactly the same as the
old American Civil War song "Aura Lea."

69
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,929
And a seemingly uncountable number of songs
merely sound like other songs. The Spongebob

70
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,489
Squarepants theme has a very similar cadence
to "Blow the Man Down."

71
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,189
Soundsjustlike.com is a great resource for
exploring this further. It'll show you two

72
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:26,379
songs and how they sort of sound alike.

73
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,449
And when it comes to musical chords,
it's almost as if there's no variety at all, as

74
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,829
was famously shown by The Axis of Awesome's
"4 Chords." I've linked it in the description,

75
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,668
it's worth a watch if you haven't seen it
already. These guys sing more than 40 different

76
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,519
songs using the same four chords...

77
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,909
Even though the number of possible different
melodies is gigantic, us humans tend to gravitate

78
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,399
towards certain patterns that we like more
than others and we are influenced by what

79
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:04,229
came before us. Kirby Ferguson has a fantastic
series looking into this called "Everything

80
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,769
is a Remix." I've also linked that down in
the description. The commonalities he shows

81
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,359
are pretty crazy.

82
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,349
Well, even when it comes to lyrics, to writing,
even though, mathematically, there are more

83
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:22,669
possibilities than we could ever exhaust,
we have gravitated towards a few. In fact,

84
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:29,749
there's a form of poetic meter that is so
common it's called "Common Meter."

85
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,819
I've composed a verse using it to explain what it is.

86
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:41,879
Line one contains eight syllables. The next
contains just six. For emphasis: iambic stress.

87
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,879
That's it, no other tricks.

88
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,569
Here is a list of songs that are written in common
meter, also known as "Balad Meter." The commonness

89
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,549
of common meter is the reason you can sing
the Pokemon theme song to the tune of Gilligan's

90
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:06,379
Island. Or House of the Rising Sun. Or Amazing
Grace. You could also use almost any of Emily

91
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,859
Dickinson's poetry. Sure, they're different
melodies, but their lyrics are written in

92
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,719
the same meter.

93
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,579
There's a great video on YouTube that I've
linked below in the description that uses

94
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,759
captions to let you see just how these all
fit together.

95
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,039
Oh, and don't forget one of the greatest compositions
taking advantage of common meter's commonness:

96
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,799
Stairway to Gilligan's Island.

97
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,289
And you know what? Our brains may also be
keeping us from enjoying the entire mathematical

98
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:42,599
space of available songs. For instance,
research has shown that the way a song compresses,

99
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:50,659
using software, can help us predict how enjoyable
it will be. Too simple, too easy to compress,

100
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:57,819
like, say, a rising scale, and the song doesn't
challenge us - it's boring. But too complicated,

101
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,239
say, white noise, and the file won't compress
very much at all, and, likewise, we don't

102
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,169
seem to enjoy it. There's a magic zone where
a file is compressible by a computer, and

103
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,749
also happens to be enjoyable by us.

104
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:19,079
So, interestingly, even though mathematically
speaking, there are so many possible unique

105
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,239
melodies that we can safely say, there will
always be room for new music, we don't seem

106
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,469
to be wired to care. We enjoy certain patterns
and melodies and calculating how many there

107
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,929
could be is a lot less interesting than how
connected and similar all the ones that we

108
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:44,759
enjoy are. It's as if we have more space than
we need, more space than we could ever hope

109
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,028
to see all of, or visit all of, or know all
of, but no matter what new place we go, in

110
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:57,819
a general sense, new, popular music will always
remind us a bit of home.

111
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,699
And as always,

112
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:10,459
thanks for watching.

113
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,139
Fantastic, you're still here. If you want
to hear music from people like you, from Vsaucers,

114
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,499
go check out WeSauce. You can submit music,
animation, short films, anything that you're

115
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,939
making and putting on YouTube to us and we'll
feature it on WeSauce. It's like a trailer

116
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,648
for what Vsaucers are doing.

117
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,528
Speaking of which, Jake Chudnow, who does
all of the music in these videos, has a brand

118
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:39,220
new song out over on his channel,
which I highly suggest you go give a listen.
