1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,058
This cow has an illusion face.
See the people about to kiss?

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,909
And oh my gosh, what's this?
Nice.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,739
It's episode 44 of IMG!

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,749
If you eat too many Pringles you'll feel like

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,709
this.
And if you look like this, your kids will

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,889
too.
Now, if you look at this right in the middle

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,528
and move your head towards and away, the stars
will appear to rotate.

8
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:29,319
And speaking of rings of things, these are
4 perfectly round circles.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,078
Give yourself a new face in the sand or, if
you're lucky, find a sweeter face in some

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,289
ice cream.
Now if this one dot represents all the fire

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:45,359
power used by all sides during World War II,
one Poseidon submarine contains the raw explosive

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,148
fire power of 3 world wars.
Oh and the rest of these dots?

13
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:55,779
They represent the total fire power of all
man made nuclear weapons currently on Earth.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,948
Vertical comic time.
Okay, alright, cool.

15
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:00,689
Zoom in.
Yep, that's what I thought.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,289
Now, let's be serious.
Animated GIFs.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,629
Of course, when the format was first created
its developers pronounced it "jif," which

18
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,629
is reflected in their parody phrase "Choosy
developers choose .g[j]if."

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,889
But the Oxford English Dictionary says that
both "gif" and "jif" are correct.

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,929
The music playing right now, by the way, was
designed by sound therapists.

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:29,029
It's called weightless and it was constructed
to biologically be the most relaxing noise

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,089
possible.
It causes your brain waves and your heart

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,879
rate to synchronise.
According to the researchers, the next most

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:45,879
relaxing songs ever made in order are these.
And now a company that makes custom-stuffed

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:58,839
animals based on your children's drawings.
Enjoy.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,769
Ah, come on, cheer up.
Here's a cleaning cart with a big grin.

27
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,429
Which these girls don't have.
I mean, come on, he'd rather touch a koala

28
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,079
butt.
Let's get infographic-y.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,649
This interactive site shows when Mosaic started,
what all of its versions looked like and moves

30
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,199
through Netscape to Opera, IE, and beyond.
And this flowchart lets you choose the perfect

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,059
book off of NPR's list of the top 100 sci-fi
and fantasy books.

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,039
Finally, here's a great infographic about
our solar system that shows distances from

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,449
the Sun to scale.
We've got the Earth, Saturn, all the way out

34
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:46,619
to dwarf planet Pluto and beyond.
Hey Vsauce! Michael Here!

35
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,089
That's right.
You just witnessed our first tweet ever.

36
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,539
You can find it @tweetsauce.
The first 1,000 people to follow us will be

37
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,598
the ones I truly love.
This will be a place where we put cool mind-blowing

38
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,658
stuff that doesn't make it to the videos.
So check it out...

39
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,418
And as always,

40
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,799
thanks for watching.
