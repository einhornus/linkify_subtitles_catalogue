1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,698
A bra gun holster?

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:07,039
An electromagnet plus balls equals

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,348
woooo!
Vsauce, Kevin here.

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,139
This is Mind Blow.
Touch screens are okay,

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,299
but how about touching a force field?
Using infrared sensors this multi touch system

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,669
allows a traditional monitor to be
manipulated by hand. It can also be

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,069
suspended in air

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,629
to control a screen from afar.
Bosses can spy on their workers from afar

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,639
with this telepresence balloon.
This floating blimp shows a projection of

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,879
a person's face.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,439
It's controlled remotely and broadcasts
audio through a built-in speaker.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,939
If that wasn't weird enough, just hug a robot.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,689
Telenoid is another telepresence device,
except it has facial expressions

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,218
transmitted from the user through webcam
and facial recognition software.

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,979
And don't worry, there's a handheld version.

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,619
Bipedal robots are usually heavy and unstable, but Kermit here can hop.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,029
And that giant arm isn't being used to
aid in the jumping,

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,249
even though it looks like.
Humans can hop higher with the Bogo

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,849
Pogo, a redesigned pogo stick featuring a 'boassist,'

20
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,379
an aircraft grade aluminum.
Using audio-video illusion the McGurk effect

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,079
is a perceptual phenomena which
causes your vision to overmatch your

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,559
hearing.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,899
The man says "bah," but your eyes see "fah,"

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:45,239
so you end up hearing "fah."

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,199
Now it's time for a giant cross
post slingshot.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,749
This thing shoots 6 steel balls simultaneously to

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,489
to trash watermelon and wood boards.
To learn how to MacGyver things for

28
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,129
yourself

29
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,299
check out Mac recipes, a website
dedicated to every MacGyver-ism. And still

30
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,868
not sure how we turned that coffin

31
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:10,648
into a jet ski. I'm also not sure how this
helps you play basketball,

32
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,859
but apparently a French team seems to
think that it works.

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,969
Converse made a huge mirror out of Chuck Taylor's

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,339
that works by mapping the user's
movements and spinning the sneakers.

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,329
Breakfast is said to be the most
important meal of the day.

36
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,159
So, here it is floating in slow motion.

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,029
But you might prefer eating ten pounds

38
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,009
of gummy bears

39
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,529
that reenact your favorite classic video
games, like Breakout

40
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,709
and Pac-Man.
Finally, here's a real

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:54,459
epic animatronics from John Nolan.

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:03,099
I'm gonna leave you with the riddle.

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,289
There was green house.
Inside the green house

44
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,389
there was a white house.
Inside the white house

45
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,629
there was a red house.
Inside the red house

46
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,419
there were a lot of babies.
What is it?

47
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,429
And now for the genius of the week.
There are four video game references

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,539
in this video and there's one at
Facebook.com/vsaucegaming.

49
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,919
Find all five video game references

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,879
and leave your answer in the comments
below. The first person to do so

51
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,679
correctly

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,359
will be our genius of the week.
Good luck.

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,319
And as always,

54
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,560
thanks for watching.
