00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:05,298
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And that's the
view from outside my apartment,

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,569
which I won't be going out in because a
hurricane is coming.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,138
But don't worry, there are plenty of
things to do online now guys.

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,859
To learn about yourself, MisterStopert
suggests what happened

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,238
my birth year. It unravels slowly and
gives some fun

6
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:22,438
perspective.
But Sporcle is the Olympics of

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,469
geekiness. Some of its games are easy, like Guess the Font and some are amazingly difficult.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,609
For the past few weeks I've been memorizing

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,129
national flags and on Sporcle
you have to know the flag

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,039
and spell the country right. Even more
geographic is this US drag-and-drop.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,619
Grab a state and place it in its correct
location. The game averages how many

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,229
miles

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,789
you're off.
If you like being tested and you like Tetris,

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,249
you can play Statetris. They've got all
kinds of maps, where the countries fall like

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,309
Tetris pieces

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,709
you have to manipulate and properly place.
If you're already a geo wizz, try

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,709
Which Is It's Dog Breed Trivia game.
But why look at shapes,

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,969
when you could just type? Z-Type is an awesome
game where you have to type the enemy's

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,179
word. Each correct letter is a shot.
Of course,

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,509
it's more fun to prove you're a human.
Captcha invaders sends ships to attack

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,269
your city

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,359
and your only defense is filling out the captions.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,399
If you'd rather avoid facts and have
pretty colors, Bioniccommando1000

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,039
sent me

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,689
RetroShoot. You steer with the mouse,
never stop firing

26
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,079
and it feels so good when you let off a bomb.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,239
He also recommended Monito. Your cursor
is attached to a ball with a springy

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,859
string,

29
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,069
so watch that its momentum doesn't throw
it into danger.

30
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,228
But if you'd rather cut stuff, play Splitter,
where clever slicing

31
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,548
gets you results.
Tomdemey sent me

32
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,559
Gravity Guy. Your character constantly
runs and it's up to you

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,199
to reverse and re-reverse gravity at just
the right time to keep his path smooth.

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,859
For more constant change, MissBabygirl3601
sent over Four Second Frenzy,

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,249
a barrage of games where you only have four
seconds to complete

36
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,859
each one using only the arrow keys and
the spacebar. When you're done playing

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,919
games, here are some things you can do on
YouTube now guys.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,208
Yesterday Jake showed me these awesome
videos of the world

39
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,899
where a guys integrates his hands like 
he's playing with people and cars

40
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,528
as if they're his toys. Also interesting
is this video about a structure

41
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:22,568
built by artist Wim Delvoye.
It's a machine containing

42
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:26,539
enzymes, bacteria, grinders, pumps.
You put real food

43
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,918
in one end and out the other -
I'm not kidding - comes actual,

44
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,759
synthetically made, poop.
Have a good weekend.

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,639
And as always,

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,980
thanks for watching.
