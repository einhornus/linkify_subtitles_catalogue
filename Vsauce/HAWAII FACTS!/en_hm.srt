1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,188
Vsauce! Michael here,
and I am back from vacation.

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,219
You may not have known,
but I just spent the last week in Hawaii

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,699
with my mother and my sister.
She's the one hiding right

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,129
there. I worked on my tan, grew my beard back out,
and most importantly

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,399
I learned a lot and I wanted to share
some of that knowledge with you today.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,618
In fact, on Saturday, I'm gonna release
a brand new

7
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:24,099
Vsauce Leanback, made out of videos from
producers all over YouTube

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,469
that I was inspired to watch after
learning things in Hawaii.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,049
It's going to be exciting, but today,
right now, let's get started and begin

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,819
with Pearl Harbor. In 1941 more than 300
Japanese fighters attacked

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,549
the US naval base at Pearl Harbor.
The USS Arizona was one of the many

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,749
battleships damaged

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,819
or sunk and the Arizona was left

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,279
right where it sank. It's still there and
a memorial has been built right on top

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,718
of it.

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,328
From the memorial you can see something
pretty surprising.

17
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,029
The ship is still leaking fuel.

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,378
It once held more than a million gallons
of fuel and so

19
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,199
even today, 70 years later,
it continues to leak five gallons of gas

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,829
every day into the ocean. In fact, you can
actually smell it from the memorial.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,569
The Navy hasn't fixed it yet because the
leak is seen as a constant reminder

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,919
of what happened and as tears that have continued to flow

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,249
ever since the day of the attack.
Pearl Harbor also has this giant map,

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,298
which shows you something else I was
excited about being close to -

25
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,399
the International Date Line.
It's an arbitrary line where the new day

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,048
begins. You see, when the Sun rises in the
morning for these Pacific Islands,

27
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,368
different days are beginning.
In Samoa

28
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,828
it might be 9 in the morning on
Thursday, but just a few hundred miles

29
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:43,559
away,

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,989
across the dateline,
it's 9 in the morning on

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,129
Friday. One day in the future. This means
that some pretty weird things can happen.

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,719
For instance,

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,908
Amelia Earhart disappeared without a trace

34
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,419
while traveling from New Guinea to Howland Island.

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,298
She was talking, communicating and most definitely live

36
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,789
on July 3rd.
But then she crossed the dateline

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,918
and disappeared forever on July 2nd.

38
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,429
At the Dole Plantation you can take a train

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,579
called the Pineapple Express and see
coffee being grown.

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,789
Or you can visit Kona and toast the
camera with coffee

41
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,949
made from beans right below you.
If you prefer softer beans, grab a shaved ice

42
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,488
from Matsumoto

43
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,589
with red beans at the bottom.
Or

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,169
eat some shrimp so fresh that they were
grown in ponds

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,738
right behind the shrimp shack.
This is the hospital Barack Obama was born in

46
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,029
and the top of Diamond Head,
a volcanic tuff cone in Honolulu,

47
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,809
has a great view of the city, but it's so
windy that all around the steep sides

48
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,689
are clumps

49
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,909
of lost hats.
By the way,

50
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,979
the camera I've been using entire time
says it's waterproof

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:13,339
and to find out if it is, I'm gonna send my
sister down. Good luck.

52
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,859
Finally, Mauna Kea, the highest point in Hawaii

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,908
and, if measured from its seafloor base, a mountain

54
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,999
taller than Mount Everest. It's above the
clouds, so driving up is really freaky.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,679
You literally drive into and through the cloud line.

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,878
The dry air, high-altitude, and comair make it perfect

57
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,598
for observing space. I didn't get to use
those telescopes, but people had smaller

58
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,469
ones I could use

59
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,749
pointed right at Saturn.
I tried to get camera footage of it and this

60
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,819
is the best I could do.

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,279
To learn more about Saturn

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,018
and Hawaii's volcanic activity and a
whole host of other issues, be sure to

63
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:52,458
watch

64
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,289
our Leanback coming out this Saturday.
It's an autoplaying playlist

65
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,238
that I host full of video clips from
producers all over YouTube, so they get

66
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:01,908
the views

67
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,179
and if you like what they make,
you can subscribe to them. Stay tuned for that.

68
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,579
And as always,

69
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,940
thanks for watching.
