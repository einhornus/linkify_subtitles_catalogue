00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,188
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And this week I am

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:07,729
in San Francisco. I just flew in a couple
of days ago, so I've been busy traveling,

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,229
but new episodes of
regular shows like IMG! and DONG are

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,089
coming soon. But in the meantime rather than
post nothing I figured I would share

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,989
things that have been on my mind.
For instance, go back to the Golden Gate

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,499
Bridge

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,069
footage. There. Her. 
That's the girl I sat next to on the flight.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,139
Turns out she's an immunology researcher
at a university in Italy.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,098
She's studying these parasitic worms in
Africa that that infect people,

10
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,619
but then leave those people immune
to things like diabetes

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,459
and allergies. In fact, if you cure these
people of the worm infection

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,128
they once again become susceptible to
things like diabetes and allergies.

13
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,999
It's really incredible, so, I guess,
good luck girl on the plane to solving that

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,099
because it sounds

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,308
awesome. On the flight I also did a bunch
of reading. I read this entire book.

16
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:56,249
The history of Britain in really tiny
little bite-sized chunks.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,749
Now, the thing that really blew my mind
was about Ireland

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,689
and the potato famine in the 1840s.
So many people

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,978
died or left the country because at
that famine

20
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,099
that to this day the population of Ireland is still

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,658
lower than it was a hundred and fifty
years ago

22
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,798
before the famine.
Speaking of things like people and birth rates,

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,179
Breathingearth[.net] is an amazing website.
You can just sit there

24
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,789
and let the site visually show you,
based on recent statistics, where people are

25
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,669
being born

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,309
and dying and how frequently.
A blue Sun represents a birth

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,149
and a black dot represents a death.

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,529
This is a picture of Anne Hathaway.
So is

29
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,899
this.
Except this Anne Hathaway is much, much older

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,459
and she's also quite famous.
This Anne Hathaway was the wife

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,929
of William Shakespeare.
Now, we don't have a photograph of her because

32
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,629
photography as we know it today wasn't even
invented until two hundred years after

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,158
that Anne Hathaway died.
This is the first

34
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,939
permanent photograph ever taken by
mankind. It's a view from a window in

35
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,959
France taken in

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,139
1836.
Two years later,

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,549
in 1838, this photograph was taken.

38
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,789
And what's significant about it is that
it's the first photograph

39
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,669
ever taken that had people people in it.
If you look down here, for instance, you can see a man

40
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,598
at a water pump.

41
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,779
Modern colorization of the image have
also claimed to have discovered

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,049
other people in the picture.
Now, none of them are very clear,

43
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,449
which is why we should talk about Robert Cornelius.

44
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,509
I actually hid this portrait in the
beginning of

45
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,809
the most recent IMG!
And the reason it's significant is that this

46
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,139
picture is the first portrait ever taken.

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,809
It's the first capturing of light
reflected off a human's face.

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,289
Think of it this way: there is no other photograph

49
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,499
of anybody older than this.
This is the oldest human

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,619
we have a photographic record of.
Finally,

51
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,859
here's a picture that IMG!
would be proud of. A photo

52
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,279
of a musical parody group
called "The Horrible CERN Girls,"

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,009
formed out of employees at CERN.
The initials of their name in French are C, E,

54
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,169
R, N.
But why should we care about this picture?

55
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,848
Well, in 1992, Tim Berners-Lee

56
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:14,339
uploaded this photo to a website, making

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,459
this image the very first photographic image

58
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,499
ever on the Internet.
But here

59
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,759
is something that has never happened.
Along the border of

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,699
China and Bhutan is a mountain called
Gangkhar Puensum.

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,119
At 24,800 feet high it is the
tallest mountain in the world

62
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,458
that mankind has yet to reach the top of.

63
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,649
The local government prohibits not
nearing in the region, which means it

64
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,149
might be left unconquered for quite some
time, making it one of just

65
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,859
many things on Earth
that we have yet to explore.

66
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,839
In a couple of days we'll have a new episode of
DONG, so be sure to subscribe to Vsauce.

67
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,659
And as always,

68
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,180
thanks for watching.
