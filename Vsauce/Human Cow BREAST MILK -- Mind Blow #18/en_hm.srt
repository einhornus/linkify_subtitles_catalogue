1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,319
A vending machine toy capsule wall

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:09,099
and Charlie Sheen mask

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,558
Vsauce, Kevin here.

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,659
This is Mind Blow.
You know Mario Kart's

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,079
Rainbow Road?
Well, here's the rainbow walk way.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,938
It's a 52 metre panorama located on the
roof of a building in Denmark

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,259
and visitors can walk around.
Wow.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,678
So that's what life as a hula hoop looks like.

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,569
Well, alright. And here's what the
tallest LEGO building looks like.

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,628
Children in Brazil pieced together
500,000 LEGOs

11
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,439
and then a guy on a crane stacked them
over 102

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,669
feet.
The Reactable's an electronic musical

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,218
instrument with a tangible user
interface. By placing blocks on the table

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,308
and interfacing with the visual display,

15
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,979
a virtual modular synthesizer is operated and,

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:08,919
okay, just check this out.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,079
Okay, now which one of these things is a robot?

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,479
And time's up.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,509
Now, beer bot. Exploders guns are
kind of like a paintball gun

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,319
mixed with a water gun. They use amo
called "H2 Grow Exploders"

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,339
that can shoot up to 85 feet. These dairy
cows in China have been genetically

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,419
modified to produce human breast milk.

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,779
Sun explosion.

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,179
Hey, you kids want some wet ice cream? 
This amphibious ice cream van,

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,999
the first of its kind, floats around
London and makes about as much sense as

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,408
trombone flame thrower.

27
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,649
This flame bone is made up from plumbing, torch

28
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,179
and compressed air parts and shoots a 21 foot

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,199
fireball.
Which maybe the armor sleeve can stop.

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,159
Equipped with a high-voltage stutter,
video camera and flash light.

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,919
A pull pane preps the stutter
and a button on the palm activates it.

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,149
It's encased with a hard shell and,
oh, there's Kevin Costner.

33
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,449
Finally, here's the Zelda theme brought to you by

34
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:33,279
the Tesla Orchestra.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,209
I'm gonna leave you with a riddle.

36
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,799
"The ages of a father and son add up to 66.

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,809
"The father's age is the son's age reversed.

38
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,139
"How old could they be?"
There are three possible answers/

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,129
The first person to get all 3 answers
right and name the anime reference

40
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,079
in this video will be our genius of the week.
So good luck.

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,319
And as always,

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,880
thanks for watching.
