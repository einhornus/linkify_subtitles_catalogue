1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:13,599
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This is Earth as
seen from Saturn. That is us right there.

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,319
And if you look closely, ok, see this
little protuberance? That's the Moon.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,469
This image was taken by the Cassini
spacecraft on July 19th, 2013 at 21:27

4
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:32,278
Coordinated Universal Time. The thing is,
NASA gave the public advanced warning

5
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,738
of when it would be taken, which means
that this image of Earth was the first

6
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,988
ever taken from space that some people on
Earth were actually posing for. Our planet

7
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:54,858
looks so small, insignificant, fragile.
I recently attended the premiere of Sky

8
00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:00,009
1's upcoming "You, Me and the Apocalypse"
with some cool YouTubers and it got me

9
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,899
thinking. In the show, the characters find
out that they're only 34 days left before

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:13,169
a comet smashes into Earth that's likely
to end humanity. They all react in

11
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,809
different interesting ways, but what
would I do if I found out that there

12
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,879
were only 34 days

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,779
of human history left? Ok, my first priority
would be to get back to America to be

14
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,279
with my family.

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,429
But after that? I don't really have a
bucket list. Except that is exactly what

16
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,879
I would want to spend my last few weeks
doing. Making a list to put in a bucket

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,129
that I would then send far out into
space away from Earth's impending

18
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:54,269
vaporization. The list would contain
information about us, all Earthlings. So

19
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,368
that if libraries and monuments and
YouTube videos were all destroyed, a

20
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,868
record would still exist somewhere

21
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:08,898
of what and who we were. Like a stone
thrown into a lake, the ripples your life

22
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:15,199
causes last long after you vanish,
the tree you planted is climbed by future

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,299
generations, the books you donated inform
future readers. But what if it's not just

24
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:31,299
your stone that vanishes, but the entire pond?
Perhaps it's arrogance or vanity, but

25
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,589
getting cosmic messages in a bottle out
there, before the end, diversifies our

26
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,529
archive and gives a better chance for
future alien visitors, or whatever is

27
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,199
left of humanity, to find out that we
were once here,

28
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,109
to show what we learned. Maybe even to warn
future life forms of what we did or what

29
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,169
we didn't prepare for. We have already
sent some messages about humanity out

30
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:05,439
there, beyond Earth, and if Earth is
completely destroyed, those messages will

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,629
be all that's left of us. What are they?
Ok, first things first. How do you write

32
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:20,229
something for the future? I mean,
the distant future. The message might not be

33
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,469
found for millions of years or billions.
It might be discovered by an audience

34
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,318
that's completely different, not only in
language, but in senses? What if

35
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,979
they can't see or hear or feel or taste
or smell like we do, or at all.

36
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,059
What if their bodies destroy the very material
we write the message on? What language

37
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,699
do you even write it in? Well, in general, math
and physics, which are believed to be the

38
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,249
same everywhere in the universe,
have been what we write outer space bound

39
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,249
messages in.

40
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,149
Like the Arecibo message, written by
Frank Drake, Carl Sagan and others, which

41
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:06,269
was blasted towards the M13 star cluster
in 1974. It's composed of a semi prime

42
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:11,059
number of binary digits conveying some
info about us and it should reach the

43
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,528
center-ish of the M13 cluster in about
25,000 years, at which

44
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,849
point, if something intelligent lives
there and detects it, they can respond

45
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:28,599
and their response will return to us
another 25,000 years later. We won't be

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,659
around for that. But Earth has also been
broadcasting its radio and TV signals

47
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,499
into space. Currently it's about 200
light-years in diameter. Compared to the

48
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:49,439
Milky Way, it's about this big. Aliens within
that bubble could tune in and listen to

49
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,629
programs we sent out through our
airwaves, but these signals thin out as the

50
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,239
bubble expands. Across very large
distances they may be essentially

51
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,549
impossible to tune into.

52
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,299
Maybe a physical time capsule would be
more permanent, but it can't be buried on

53
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,609
Earth if Earth is about to be ravaged.
A time capsule in orbit might be smart,

54
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:22,629
like LAGEOS-1, a satellite put into orbit
in 1976 that allows for very precise

55
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:30,399
laser measurements of positions on Earth, 
but also contains a plaque designed by Carl Sagan, upon

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:39,939
which is written the numbers 1 to 10 in the binary, and the arrangement of the Earth's continents 250 million years ago,

57
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:47,459
today and their estimated arrangement
in 8.4 million years, which is how long we believe

58
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:54,099
the satellite's orbit will be stable. Drag caused by the thin atmosphere up where it orbits and

59
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,279
influences like solar activity

60
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,329
will eventually cause it to fall back down
to Earth, but its plaque will serve as a

61
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:07,289
time capsule - a message from us today to
whatever happens to be alive or

62
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,259
intelligent here on Earth

63
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,659
8 million years in the future.
To put that in perspective, the pyramids

64
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:21,889
were only built about 5,000 years ago.
8 million years ago, there weren't even

65
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:29,399
humans on the Earth. The latest common ancestor of
humans and chimpanzees was around though.

66
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,839
8 million years from today, when LAGEOS
returns, what will intelligent life on

67
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,959
Earth look like? If Earth's surface is
barren of life at that point, LAGEOS-1

68
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,759
will be alone. But what about
satellites in geostationary orbits? These

69
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,169
orbits are far enough out that they're
much safer from atmospheric drag and

70
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,369
could remain above Earth much much
longer than satellites like LAGEOS.

71
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,299
These satellites are our pyramids. They're
smaller than monuments built by past

72
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,539
civilizations, but impervious to anything
that might go wrong on the less stable

73
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,089
surface of our planet. If alien
archaeologists come by in a billion

74
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,519
years or so, these satellites may be what
their alien encyclopedias use as the

75
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,079
picture for the humans article. So far we
have erected about 450

76
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,219
of these geostationary monuments.
When such a satellite wears down and

77
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,589
ceases to be operational, it takes a lot
of energy to slow it down so it can move

78
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,999
out of the way and fall to Earth to burn up in
the atmosphere. So instead, they're

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,259
usually pushed into what's known as a
graveyard orbit.

80
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,599
A shell around the planet where they can
be part without interfering with

81
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,089
important operational satellites.
It's fitting that we call these graveyard

82
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,709
orbits because tombs are often the most
stunning things we have from previous

83
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:07,279
civilizations. These graveyard orbits are
tombs in a way. Not for kings, but for

84
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,619
machines. Junkyards that will out-exist the
very societies and people they so

85
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,329
largely define. Luckily, a few contain
more than just our craftsmanship. They

86
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:26,279
also contain a record, like EchoStar XVI,
a communications satellite launched into

87
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,629
geostationary orbit in 2012. Aboard it is a
silicon disc created by artist Trevor

88
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,989
Paglen, containing 100 images of
Earth and Earthlings. Now, unlike LAGEOS,

89
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:46,269
EchoStar XVI will likely remain in orbit
for billions of years,

90
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:53,579
safe from discord and change down here.
But here's the thing. What if our entire

91
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,389
solar system is lost? Or what if life out
there doesn't decide to ever visit our

92
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,869
system? Well, in that case, we have sent
interstellar messages. At this moment, so

93
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,679
far, there are 11 distinct human made
things on trajectories out of the

94
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,869
solar system into interstellar space.
They're all related to five probes.

95
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,719
Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and
Voyager 2 and New Horizons, the thing

96
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,989
that recently made a Pluto flyby.
These objects are our most distant hellos.

97
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,369
Over the next ten thousand, million,
billion years, they'll pass close enough

98
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,069
to other star systems, maybe even planets,
to possibly be discovered by other

99
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,648
intelligent life forms. We had the
foresight to include special messages on

100
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:52,989
these probes. The Pioneer plaques are
attached to Pioneer 10 and 11, which

101
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,838
launched in the early 1970's,
were the first human-made objects to

102
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,679
ever be sent on a trajectory to not just
leave Earth, but to leave the solar

103
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:10,059
system entirely. If discovered by other
life out there, these plaques, designed by

104
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,458
Frank Drake and Carl Sagan,
could be our first chance to say "hello,

105
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:22,309
we exist," or, depending on how long
humanity lasts, our only chance to say

106
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,539
"Hello,

107
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:31,319
we existed. This is what we were." But will
the plaques makes sense to aliens? Many

108
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,278
humans scientists have had trouble
deciphering their meaning, but here's

109
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,729
what they say. At the bottom is a map of
our solar system with a path showing the

110
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,689
Pioneer probe itself and where it came
from. This element has been particularly

111
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,708
criticized for being human centric.
I mean, an arrow? Who's to say aliens will know

112
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:58,069
that this depicts a path and not some
structure in our solar system? Also, it's

113
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,639
an arrow. Arrows might convey this way
only two civilizations that hunted or

114
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:10,289
developed pointy projectiles. Anyway. 
Up here, we define units. You can't tell

115
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,539
aliens about humans or Earth by using
seconds, kilometres or light years,

116
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:20,379
because we made those measurements up.
Instead, the plaque uses hyperfine

117
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,229
transitions to communicate distances and time.
The hope is that curious

118
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,109
intelligent life forms who find this
will understand that this is a hydrogen

119
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:38,439
atom - one proton, one electron. Hydrogen is
the most abundant element in the

120
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,879
universe, so hopefully its properties
will be a common point of understanding.

121
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,719
Now sometimes, if you've got enough
hydrogen around, you can catch atoms in

122
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,449
the heap transitioning between particles
with parallel spins and antiparallel

123
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,299
spins. Now, whenever this transition
happens, electromagnetic radiation is

124
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,369
released with a period of about 2.7
nanoseconds and a wavelength of about

125
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,779
21 centimetres. It's hoped that
aliens equate this tick mark with these

126
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:16,129
two units of measurement. For example,
the woman is said to be, in binary, eight of

127
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,679
these units tall. 21 centimetres times
eight is a 168 centimetres.

128
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,519
You would think that putting
the probe itself behind them for scale

129
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,329
would be enough to show our size,
but having both might help solidify the

130
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,429
connection. This diagram is meant to show
where we live. We are in the middle.

131
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,789
The direction and proportional length of
the lines show where distant pulsars are.

132
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,939
A tick-mark near the ends of each line
shows the third direction, behind or in

133
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,139
front of the plaque, that the line should
go in. In binary, next to each line is the

134
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,099
period of each pulsar. Again, in the
time units described above. If aliens

135
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,589
make this connection they could possibly
match the periods with the correct

136
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,569
pulsars in real life,

137
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,499
triangulate our position and come say hello.

138
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,089
Also, since the period of a pulsar
changes over time, they could use our

139
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,929
observed periods to date back how long
ago this plaque was made. So that's how

140
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,019
the plaque works. It kind of feels like
we're just sending out a bunch of

141
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,389
science homework to space, but how else
can you find common ground with

142
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,499
something that might not resemble you in
any way you could even imagine? Despite

143
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,849
heading out first,

144
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,539
the Pioneer plaques are not the first
physical messages made by us to go

145
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,768
interstellar.

146
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:49,458
That title belongs to Voyager 1.
Currently moving at 17 km/s, it is

147
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,378
the most far-out thing humans have ever made.

148
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:58,719
Literally. In about 40,000 years,
both Voyagers will pass within less than

149
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,508
two light years of other stars.
If aliens find them, or if future

150
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:10,698
humans find them, a golden record is attached to
both that contains information about

151
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:15,748
humanity. The record is made of gold
plated copper with an aluminum cover,

152
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:21,938
containing some uranium 238. Given its
half-life, smart aliens could analyze it

153
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:27,609
to determine how long ago the record was
made. On the record is the inscription to

154
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:36,219
the makers of music All Worlds All Times.
The record contains 116 images, as well

155
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,338
as audio and video recordings of humans,
animals, songs and greetings in fifty

156
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:47,849
five languages. Printed on the record are
instructions for playback and info about

157
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,849
us. The hydrogen hyperfine transition
unit definition and the Pulsar map,

158
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,558
included on the Pioneer plaques, but the
record also comes with a stylus and

159
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:03,719
platter to play it. Instructions for using
the stylus are on the record. This is a

160
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,368
picture of the stylus being used
correctly and then in binary using the

161
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:12,508
transition units, the record tells the
aliens that the stylus should go around

162
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:17,518
the record once every 3.6 seconds
to play back correctly and in

163
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,888
total should take about one hour to do so.
For the video portion, instructions

164
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,008
are given in a circle. The first video
image is displayed, so they know they did

165
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:28,909
it right.

166
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,539
Also included on the record is a message
from then-president of the United States,

167
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,198
Jimmy Carter. There's something
vulnerable about the message. It's

168
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,179
delivered to an unknown recipient,
like when someone in a horror movie asks

169
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,639
into the darkness "Is anyone there?

170
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:58,249
Hello?" This is what it says. "We cast this message
into the cosmos. It is likely to survive

171
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,949
a billion years into the future, when our
civilization is profoundly altered and

172
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,229
the surface of the Earth

173
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,479
may be vastly changed. Of the two hundred
billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy,

174
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,849
some, perhaps many, may have inhabited
planets and space faring civilizations.

175
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,839
If one such civilization intercepts
Voyager and can understand these

176
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:29,669
recorded contents, here is our message.
This is a present from a small, distant

177
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:36,699
world. A token of our sounds, our science,
our images, our music, our thoughts and

178
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,059
our feelings. We are attempting to
survive our time, so we may live into

179
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,589
yours. We hope someday, having solved the
problems we face, to join a community of

180
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,969
galactic civilizations. This record
represents our hope and our

181
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:01,389
determination and our goodwill in a vast
and awesome universe." Are these messages

182
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,469
enough?

183
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:11,209
Should we send more? Well, why not send
everything? We could, if we sent the

184
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,739
Library of Babel.

185
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,909
It's a website built by Jonathan Basile
that currently offers everything that

186
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,098
has been or could be written.

187
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:32,058
Seriously. Divided into pages, it is built
to produce and locate on demand any 3200

188
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:37,029
character combination of English letters
and the comma, space and period. Basile

189
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:42,119
has organized it all into hexagon-shaped
rooms, each with four walls of books

190
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,279
containing five shelves with 32 volumes
of four hundred and ten pages each.

191
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,599
Everything's arranged in a pseudo-random
fashion, so browsing the online library

192
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,999
feels like a treasure hunt.
Here's how it works.

193
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,869
Each page is given a unique sequential
page number in base 10. The text on each

194
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,999
page is encased inside this number.

195
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,759
An algorithm Basile created uses the
page number as a seed to generate a

196
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,269
unique big number. That output is then
converted into base 29 so that it can be

197
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,759
represented using every letter in the
English alphabet as well as the comma,

198
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,999
the space and the period. This is what
you see on the page. Basile has made

199
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,819
sure that the algorithm will produce
every possible combination and the same

200
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,009
page number will create the same output
every time.

201
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:47,899
Which means that what is on each page is
already predetermined. So, in a way, every

202
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,419
page already exists.
It only needs to be looked up.

203
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,849
And here is the really mind blowing
thing. The contents of a page can be

204
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:04,099
converted to base 10, sent through the
inverted algorithm and turned into the

205
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:12,809
exact page number they're found on. It's a
truly eerie experience, because you can

206
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:19,659
find the permanent location for any 3200
character text. You can find in this

207
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,929
library the description of your birth,
every possible description of your death,

208
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,159
every poem, every joke, every lie,
anything that could be said

209
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,309
can be found on this site.

210
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:44,059
This thing blurs the line between invention
and discovery. Did you really discover or invent

211
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:49,629
that thing if its description already existed?
10 to the 5,000 different

212
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,439
pages

213
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,799
are offered by the Library of Babel.
In comparison, there are only 10 to the 80 atoms

214
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,559
in the observable universe.
I searched for what I've just said and

215
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:10,249
sure enough in this hexagon, on this wall,
this shelf and this volume on this page it's

216
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,019
there.

217
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,259
Hello.

218
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,868
But deep down, we feel like there's a
difference between this program

219
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:24,268
permuting something unknowingly and
a person actually meaning it, intending it,

220
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:31,058
saying it because they wanted to with
agency. We use a finite number of symbols

221
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:37,408
to say things. For that reason, a library of
every finite combination of those

222
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:42,108
symbols can be made,
but just because it can be made

223
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:50,148
doesn't need it has been said. That is
the power we have. Perhaps you and I were

224
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:55,608
born too late to explore the world and
too early in history to explore the

225
00:20:55,609 --> 00:21:01,838
stars, but we were born at just the right
time, which is pretty much all times ever

226
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:10,599
to explore language. To explore what can be
said. What should be said.

227
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,879
What should we send out to space. What that
can't be said will you be the first to say?

228
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,119
And as always,

229
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:38,589
thanks for watching.

Colin Furze is building a giant
apocalyptic bunker in his backyard, like

234
00:21:54,299 --> 00:22:00,509
for real. It's huge. Also, The Dictionary of
Obscure Sorrows has weight in. Check those
