00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,339
This is how Easter eggs are made.
And don't walk. Or bike.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,299
It's episode 32 of IMG!

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,509
Best haircut... ever.
And creepy t-shirt Abraham Lincoln.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,848
But hunting is awesome.
Oh.

5
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:23,499
Lishoffs rules. He made the Simpson's alphabet,
a superhero alphabet and curser bullies.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,358
An equally rare talent is found in Jeff Blazer.
He's the guy who photoshopped the famous

7
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,828
Orange Frog. He also made a geographical Pac-Man
and proved that Jim Henson was the puppet.

8
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,689
Europe is naughty. And here's yet another false
motion illusion. Your brain can't figure it

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,569
out, so as you look around it warps and stretches.
I suggest going fullscreen.

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:53,099
Chicks love cats. Chicks love cats. Cats
love dogs. Dogs love everything. And cats

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,979
love butt gymnastics. You know, like the balance
beam. Balance beer.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,399
This isn't a joke. This is the last thing
you will see before you die. Can you find

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,258
the cat?

14
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:23,158
But we should move on to girls in costume,
tied up. Can you save them?

15
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,728
Reddit had fun last week with police from
awesome cities like the Flippin police, the

16
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:32,069
Climax police, and the infamous Sandwich police.

17
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,539
Princess Peach. Grrrrrocery shop yellow, green,
black, red.

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,618
Deviant artist Meirou created real-life Disney
princessess. Here's Ariel and Flounder.

19
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,439
Don't look, hey, wait a second.
Let me just turn on the light... line.

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,129
But I prefer my lamps soft and gooey and
flowey. And my common objects huge. You might

21
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,709
need gloves this big to touch whatever these
kids are looking at.

22
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,889
Maybe they're watching Facebook.com/Vsaucegaming,
where you guys have submitted 5,428 images

23
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,089
as of the very moment I'm saying this.

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:14,909
Casey showed us extreme kissing, dance mode,
and Marshall dyed an egg in honor of Vsauce.

25
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,469
Trude matured things up with this actual last
name and Carl asked us to cover up the top

26
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,859
half of this equation.

27
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,889
And now it's time to watch LÜT on our other
channel, Vsauce2. It's a different channel

28
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,649
with different types of stuff, so be sure
you're subscribed, click right here to watch LÜT.

29
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,029
And as always,

30
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,290
thanks for watching.
