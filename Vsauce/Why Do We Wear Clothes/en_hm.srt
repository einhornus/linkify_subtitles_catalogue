1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,439
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,469
Why do humans wear clothing?

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,218
Sure, we need it for protection from the
elements and fashion,

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,688
to show our personalities,

5
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:15,248
but no other animal makes and wears clothing.

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:22,219
More importantly, why do we feel embarrassed
to be naked around other people?

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,439
The word "embarrassed" comes from 

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,159
the Portuguese route,

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,439
"embaraÃ§a", which means to entangle or entwine.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,579
And feeling embarrassed often
feels like being tied up or exposed.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,179
But how can a healthy

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,639
amount of embarrassment be a sign

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,369
that you are likeable,

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,549
forgivable

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,119
and trustworthy.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,779
This t-shirt and hoodie

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,028
come from the YouTube Space LA,

18
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:54,139
which opened in November of 2012.

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,379
But clothing

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,859
has been around a lot longer than that,

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,579
for at least

22
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,178
the last 100,000 years.

23
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:03,249
Clothing protects us from the cold,

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,559
from rain, from the Sun

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,789
and it can also be an ornament.

26
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,089
A way of accentuating certain parts
of our bodies or showing off wealth,

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,038
status.

28
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,939
It can even help us build

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,579
our own identities. But today I'm
interested in another use of clothing,

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,249
modesty.

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,429
Why are humans

32
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,119
afraid to be naked?

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,459
Why are we ashamed of nudity?

34
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,599
Especially because animals pretty much
walk around naked

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,959
all the time.

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,359
Why aren't animals embarrassed to be naked?

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,529
Well...

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,279
Let's take a closer look at embarrassment.

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,219
Embarrassment is a fascinating emotion and

40
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,669
an extremely social one.

41
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,469
You don't ever really ever feel embarrassed
alone, when no one's watching you or

42
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,589
listening to you.
So,

43
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,489
embarrassment probably evolved because
it is such a good influence on social

44
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,669
cooperation.

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,949
We feel embarrassed when we violate little

46
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,907
social rules of conduct and each of us
individually hoping to avoid that,

47
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:16,168
to avoid embarrassment, 
has helped all of us live together better.

48
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,168
Healthy brains experience embarrassment.

49
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,738
Neurodegeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes

50
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,079
can lead to less

51
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,118
awareness of yourself.

52
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:29,139
So a healthy amount of occasional embarrassment

53
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,488
is a good thing.

54
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,628
It's a sign of a socially adept

55
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:35,878
and normally functioning brain.

56
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,048
A famous experiment involved participants

57
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,658
watching an actor

58
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,318
receive

59
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,738
praise for achieving a very very high score

60
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,108
on an exam.

61
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,249
In some cases

62
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,068
the actor was told to feign pride in the achievement.
And in others,

63
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,149
they acted

64
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,258
embarrassed to have attention put on themselves.

65
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:56,968
Later,

66
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,408
the actors and the participants played games together

67
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:03,358
and the participants were more pro-social,

68
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,238
friendly and cooperative

69
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,278
with actors who earlier expressed embarrassment.

70
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:13,918
It's suggested that the actor was to be
trusted, that they desired to

71
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,398
fit in and work together.

72
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:21,198
Now, the fact that embarrassment displays
our knowledge of others and our desire

73
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,588
to be liked

74
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:28,108
may explain why evoking embarrassment
in others, whether it be flirtation or

75
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,869
playful teasing, is so common

76
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,068
when we kind of like the other person.

77
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:40,068
Shame is a stronger emotion.
And shame, when it comes to

78
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:45,478
our private parts, the kind nearly every
society - western or not - shares to some

79
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,759
degree is related to the root of our question today,

80
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,408
modesty.

81
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:55,428
Havelock Ellis' writing on the
evolution of modesty

82
00:03:55,429 --> 00:04:00,218
is a big antiquated when it comes to vocabulary,
but he discusses quite well

83
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,558
two possible reasons for our fear

84
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,759
of nakedness,

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,568
both of which predate clothing and
are not unique to humans.

86
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:11,448
The first

87
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,058
is the vital phenomenon of

88
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:15,518
refusal.

89
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,227
Before mating, many animals play a game of

90
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,218
chase,

91
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:20,219
hard to get,

92
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,568
a game of acceptance and then flight,

93
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:24,609
forcing the pursuer to

94
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,339
keep up

95
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,689
and prove their determination before being chosen

96
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,499
as a desirable mate.
So,

97
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,448
when it comes to humans, we can think of clothing,

98
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,428
paradoxically, as both a means of

99
00:04:37,429 --> 00:04:39,689
drawing attention to one's body

100
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,429
and simultaneously

101
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,679
as a way to

102
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,438
cover the body

103
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,359
modestly,

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,228
making us less available to every
and any potential mate,

105
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,168
rendering

106
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,038
breeding more selective.

107
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,549
Ellis also mentions the fear of evoking disgust.
And it's easy to see why

108
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,348
individuals of a species, who avoid things
we consider disgusting, would survive better.

109
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:11,348
Fecal material, waste, rubbish, other
bodily secretions can spread disease.

110
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:12,388
For instance,

111
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,648
animals whose poop likely contains
dangerous parasites avoid grazing around

112
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,348
or hanging out around

113
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,728
their waste.

114
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,999
Habits like that lead to more sanitary conditions

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,359
and a species more likely

116
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,168
to survive. It's a satisfying piece of
evidence as to why clothing once

117
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,739
invented was so quickly used to cover

118
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,288
private areas.

119
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:41,628
In 2009, the BBC
investigated another influential factor - 

120
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,728
raising children.

121
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,829
In species where the young are born
pretty much ready for life,

122
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,429
it makes more sense to spend your time making babies,

123
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,668
as opposed to sitting around raising them.
They don't need it.

124
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:01,568
Super precocial animals, like the megapode,
hatch with full flight feathers

125
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,709
and can fly on their own within hours of hatching.

126
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,888
Human babies, on the other hand,
are pretty darn altricial. We are born

127
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:16,409
barely able to do much besides swallow
food put directly into our mouths.

128
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:22,359
Newborns can't walk or talk or
cook meals for themselves or drive

129
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,598
themselves to work.

130
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,158
It's ridiculous.

131
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:29,638
Why are human babies born so unready for life?

132
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,128
Why is so much development time still
needed after human kids are born?

133
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:39,598
Well, one explanation is that it's
because we are so brilliant.

134
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:46,228
Brain size is correlated with the body size.
Bigger bodies require bigger brains.

135
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,989
The shrew has a smaller brain than a human,
but us humans have smaller brains

136
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,129
than wales.
Of course, a bigger brain is not indicative of

137
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,109
intelligence.

138
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,649
For one thing, larger animals literally
just have more cells they need to worry

139
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,528
about

140
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,089
and control.

141
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,549
What matters more when it comes to
intelligence is the proportion

142
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,649
of brain size to body size.

143
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,959
Compared to the size of our bodies,

144
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,759
our brains are gigantic, they're outliers,

145
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,969
they're off the charts.

146
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,279
It's crazy. And a consequence of this is
that in order to to have a brain, as big

147
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,288
as ours,

148
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,528
come out of a mother, as small as

149
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:35,109
a human, we have to come out with brains
that aren't fully formed. Brains and heads

150
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,178
that aren't as big as they will eventually
grow to be. And this is why human

151
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:44,118
babies require so much care and so much
time to develop before their brains are

152
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,048
ready for them to go off

153
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,568
on their own.

154
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:52,369
Under this theory, being naked and
mating all of the time

155
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,559
might be a little bit less of a
priority for humans.

156
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,888
Humans and societies that privilege modesty

157
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,088
would have more time
and resources to put toward raising children

158
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,478
and avoiding extra mates,
instead of just conceiving

159
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:08,619
more kids,

160
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,008
allowing kids to develop properly and 
reproduce themselves.

161
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,068
Clothing serves this purpose quite well.

162
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,668
It conceals the privates and allows
more time to be spent on other

163
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,148
things.

164
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:24,398
Clothes,

165
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,589
clothing

166
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,959
may, in a way, actually be a consequence of our unique

167
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,478
intelligence.

168
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,697
So the next time you put on clothes,

169
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:37,228
keep in mind that one of the reasons
you're not running out into the world

170
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,189
butt-naked

171
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,439
is because you have

172
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,349
such a big brain.

173
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,099
No matter how dumb

174
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,159
the clothing is that you're putting on,

175
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,199
it's a reminder that we

176
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,009
are smart.

177
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,369
And as always,

178
00:08:52,370 --> 00:09:00,719
thanks for watching.

179
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,679
Kevin, thank you for joining me.
Thanks for having me.

180
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,579
I hear

181
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,508
that there is an insect wing that can
naturally shred bacteria.
