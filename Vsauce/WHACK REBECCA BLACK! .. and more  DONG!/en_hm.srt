1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,409
Vsauce. Today on my subway ride into work I

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,079
earned the very final star I needed in
Angry Birds.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,159
But I know what you're thinking.
"Michael, I don't care. I want things I can do

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,989
online now, gosh!"
DONG. Let's begin

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,549
with Leanback. That's right, there's a
brand new episode of Vsauce Leanback

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,969
out today.
It's a television-length playlist

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,479
full of - this week - optical illusions.
You can start it by clicking the link

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,188
at the very top of this video's description.
'Idotidot2' pointed me to How Many

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,179
Of Me, where you can type in your name and find
out how many people in the US

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,448
have your same name. Now, if you wanna two games at
once, be like 'tjockislol'

11
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:43,948
and become Mario until you press the
spacebar and begin

12
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:46,999
Tetris to strategically help Mario.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,419
Want more pep? Well, be like 'DEEMEMH' and use GoBarbra.com

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,979
to make Duck Sauce's song about whatever you want. For instance:

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,139
"I'm watching DONG."

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,218
Too fast? Slow down with 'Erinbunny1's' reminder
of this oldie

17
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,688
in B-flat. Every embedded video is in the
same key,

18
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,219
so you can pick and choose which ones to
bring in

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,359
and when. 'Yorkerbird434' turns up the
violence with a Whack Rebecca Black game

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,749
built like YouTube.

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,169
Throw her for points and if you kinda feel bad or

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,569
weird, don't work. 'MochaholicPuppy' thinks you're a licensed toy

23
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,469
and animal psychologist. This site let's you
evaluate toys and even administer

24
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,429
drugs.

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,989
Last week I showed off a game that let's
you compose music with dots

26
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,209
and 'sofusser' created an entire Vsauce symphony.

27
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,309
'Sofusser' also made some pretty sweet
designs on World of Text, so

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,639
check them out.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,889
Last week I also talked about some work
from Mister

30
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,159
Doob. 'Gaigaigoo' said whoa, whoa, whoa,
there's more Stevens.

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,039
And there is. Mr. Doob has made a lot
of awesome things, like this page you can

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,228
drag images into

33
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,419
right from your computer and then watch them warp and twist.

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,978
Click to cause a whole new
transformation. He also built a sweet

35
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,439
browser-based fullscreen cloud simulator

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,679
you can fly through by moving your
cursor around.

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,799
But what your browser really needs is
balls and he brought those too.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,139
This site of his gives you balls you can pick
up and throw, but you can also grab the actual

39
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,399
browser window

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,359
and give it a shake.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,458
I leave you with something very special.

42
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,789
This link will take you to a video
were you can listen to what's known as

43
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,059
the IMG

44
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,679
montage music in its entirety. You now
have the power to make anything in your

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,149
life

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,049
an instant IMG montage. Of course what you
really want to do

47
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,439
is watch today's new episode of Vsauce Leanback all

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,708
about optical illusions sourced from all
over YouTube.

49
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,189
It's a really cool collection and I'm having a lot of fun making them, so check it out.

50
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,419
And as always,

51
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,680
thanks for watching.
