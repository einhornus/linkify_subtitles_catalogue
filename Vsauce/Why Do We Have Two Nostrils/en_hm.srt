1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,928
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And our faces

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,918
have a lot of holes.
We have two ears and two eyes.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,678
It makes sense, because the difference in
time it takes for a sound to reach one ear

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,479
and the other,

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,979
allows us to localize where the sound is coming from.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,819
And having two eyes gives us two
slightly different perspectives that we

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,889
can put together

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,438
in order to perceive depth.
But why do we have two

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,649
nostrils?
I mean, our sense of smell isn't good enough to localize

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,389
one nostril over the other,
why not just have a big hole in our nose,

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,599
like we have a mouth.
Well, Stanford University's olfactory research

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,429
project

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,339
investigated this and they found that
throughout the day

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,019
one nostril inhales air better and faster

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,599
than the other. Now, which one is dominant
changes throughout the day, but having

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,238
a good air sucking nostril and a not so good

17
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,959
air sucking nostril is important.
We need both,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,919
because you see, odorants and molecules
are absorbed by our skin and snot

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,499
at different rates.
Some things are absorbed so quickly

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,019
they need to be rushed on the olfactory
receptors before they're

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,339
absorbed earlier on in the nose.
Other

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,239
molecules, other odorants, are slowly absorbed

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,368
and they need to be given time to get to
the receptors and not just rushed right

24
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:23,249
to the lungs.

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,548
And so having two nostrils allows us to smell

26
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,669
more things.
Alright,

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,669
so let's smell some weird stuff, like

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,709
outer space.
What would space smell like?

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,279
Okay, right, it's a tough question,
it actually doesn't make much sense because

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,819
space

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,499
is a mere vacuum.
If you went into space and took your helmet off to

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,898
smell it, well, all of the air in your lungs
and throat, nose would be violently

33
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:58,419
sucked right out. In fact, even if you
really tried to get some sort of

34
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,029
olfactory sensation, about all you
would feel is the quick evaporation of

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,398
water coming out of your mucous membranes

36
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,189
and you might smell,
for the few seconds that you were conscious,

37
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,219
nasal fluid and blood.
That doesn't sound fun at all.

38
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,098
But here's the thing.
Objects

39
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,979
that have been taken out into space and
then returned to a

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,458
habitable atmosphere, like inside a space station,

41
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,449
smell differently than they did before

42
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,359
they went into space.
Astronauts report that their suits,

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,289
after being in space, have a strange metallic

44
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,099
burn meat arc welder fumes smell.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,869
It's believed that the odor is caused by
high energy particles

46
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,219
that cling to the suit and then, once brought inside,

47
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,889
react with the air, creating a burning

48
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,549
smell.
One particular type of high energy molecule found

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,669
all over interstellar space are polycyclic

50
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,309
aromatic hydrocarbons.
These guys are the result

51
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,238
of combustion. And in 2004,
the University of Toledo, Ohio found evidence

52
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,359
that those very molecules may exist in old

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,289
nebula. The result of convection currents 
cooling carbon and hydrogen

54
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,289
allowing them to bond into giant shapes.

55
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,929
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also formed,

56
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,359
when cooking meat at high temperatures.

57
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,878
So, in order to train astronauts even
more realistically here on earth,

58
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,499
NASA actually reached out to Steven
Pearce of Omega Ingredients

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,109
to replicate the smell of things that
have been to space

60
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,128
as a perfume.
If we know the chemical makeup of something,

61
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:48,658
even something light years away from us,
we can assemble those ingredients

62
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,839
here on earth and get an idea of what it would

63
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,298
smell like.
Recently, researchers have discovered

64
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,628
Ethyl Formate in the dust cloud Sagittarius

65
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:04,179
B2.
Now, again, if you were to go there

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,359
and lift up your space suits visor and take a whiff,

67
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,169
you would die. You wouldn't be able to take
a whiff, all of the air in your nose and

68
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,619
lungs and throat would be

69
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,917
immediately expelled.
But if you were able to take a

70
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,789
bucket of Sagittarius B2 home with you to earth

71
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,029
and then give it a smell,
because of the ethyl formate

72
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,239
Sagittarius B2's stuff

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,409
would smell like raspberries and rum.

74
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,728
Pretty neat, right?
But let's get closer to home.

75
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,489
What does the inside of your nose

76
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,638
smell like?

77
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,609
Well, it's kind of hard to know
because we are smelling it

78
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,849
all the time and our bodies become desensitized

79
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,519
to constant stimuli to keep us from
being overloaded

80
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,719
and to keep us prepared to sense any out
of the ordinary smells that

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,299
we might need to know about.
This happens to us all the time.

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,918
When you first step into a restaurant,
you can smell all the food,

83
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,019
but halfway through the meal you're
no longer aware of the smell.

84
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,319
It's called neural adaptation.
I guess the point I'm trying to make

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,138
is that in order to figure out what the
inside of a nose smells like

86
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:21,369
you'll need to smell a novel one,

87
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,939
like, for instance, smell the inside of your friend's nose.

88
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,569
It might seem weird at first,
but it could be a great way to form

89
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,038
new memories. Our sense of smell may not
be as acute as our other senses,

90
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,638
but it seems to be tied to memories very very closely.

91
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,719
A single whiff of an odor can instantly
remind you of where you used to smell

92
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,609
that smell

93
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,939
and maybe even who you were with.
This may be

94
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,929
because of the olfactories' connection to
the limbic system

95
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,109
in the brain.
Olfactory information is sent

96
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,189
through the limbic system,
which is known to be involved with

97
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,749
emotions and memories.
No other traditional sense is connected

98
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,008
to the limbic system in this way.
We've also found

99
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,329
that patients who have memory loss
caused by brain damage

100
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,138
tend to also have an impaired ability

101
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,899
to smell.
So treasure your sense of smell,

102
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,068
because it not only keeps us safe from gross

103
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:25,149
odors or rotten food, it can also keep us safe

104
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,609
from incest.
Individuals who are

105
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,689
raised together in the same home for the
first few years of their life,

106
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,859
whether they are genetically related or not,

107
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,948
will tend to be less physically
attracted to each other

108
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,519
later in life than they are to strangers.
This is known

109
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,629
as the Westermarck effect and one of the
main mechanisms it works via

110
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,649
is the olfactory system.
Us humans have an interesting ability to

111
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,769
distinguish the smell of a stranger

112
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,019
from someone that we are genetically related to or

113
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,079
grew up in very close proximity with.
This entire phenomenon may be a

114
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,198
natural way for us to avoid inbreeding.

115
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,418
But what about someone who can't smell?

116
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,359
What do we call them?
Someone who can't see is blind,

117
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,649
someone who can't hear is deaf and
someone who can't speak is mute,

118
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,978
but what do you call someone who can't smell?

119
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:28,168
Well, there's a word for the inability to smell - anosmia.

120
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,829
Now, even though the adjective form is very very rare,

121
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,589
it exists.
A person who can't smell

122
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,609
is anosmic.

123
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,019
There's another word we should have
investigated a long time ago.

124
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,279
Olfactory.
What does is it come from? Well,

125
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,429
the "ol" part comes from odor and from smell,

126
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,948
but "factory?"
Well, factories make

127
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,598
things, but the nose doesn't makes smells,

128
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,329
it smells smells.

129
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,559
Right?
Well, here's the thing. We

130
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,609
smell objects because molecules from those

131
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,239
objects react in certain ways with our olfactory

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,378
receptors.
And molecules have

133
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:19,459
specific shapes and vibrations and ways of behaving,

134
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,918
but the smell is not actually

135
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,439
intrinsic to the molecule.
The smell is merely a

136
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,159
consequence of how that molecule reacts

137
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,678
with us.
No us,

138
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,558
no smell.
So, olfactory

139
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,449
is a fantastic word.
Every sight

140
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,689
and feeling and sound and smell we get
from our universe

141
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,898
is actually just the universe reacting with

142
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,489
us.
Everything we know about the universe we know

143
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,919
because it has already been processed
and changed and analyzed and filtered

144
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,829
inside the factory of our sense.

145
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,729
And as always,

146
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,910
thanks for watching.
