1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,509
Go to sleep in a chocolate bar or a can of sardines

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,519
and an infectious disease stress ball

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,888
that you can squish.
It's episode 16

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:13,779
of LÃœT.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,948
Are you tired of wimpy straws that make
you look like a loser?

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,839
Well, grab ThinkGeek's food grade Titanium straw.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,979
It tears into fruit like metal justice.
Keep being awesome with this mirror decal

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,339
that makes you look like the star
of a press conference. Or

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,589
these decals you can use to let guests
accessorise themselves by standing

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,169
just the right way. Keep a stash of
temporary stache-tous handy

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,319
to quickly turn your finger into what
you must...stache.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,979
Then lay back on your hamburger bean
bag. It's not cheap,

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,759
but come, a diamond-shaped bean bag?
That's almost as classy

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,069
as liquor scented soaps.
Your butt is not clean

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,589
until it smells like a whiskey sour.
Also on Etsy are these adorable punk kitties

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,189
Hank

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,339
e-mailed me about. His friend makes them
and he says each one is handmade and

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,729
completely unique,

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,949
there will never be another one like it.
Speaking of e-mail,

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,019
these Air Swimmers also wound up in my
inbox. Remote-controlled

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,969
floating balloons you can scare cats with.
But if you're sick of e-mailing

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,188
you're gonna love today's free thing.
Snail Mail

23
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:23,309
My Email is a project started by Ivan Cash.
All you have to do

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,589
is send an email with the recipient's address

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,319
to snailmailmyemail@gmail.com by

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,589
August 15th. A team of volunteers will then
hand-write your message

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,169
and mail it to who you say. Write your
own awesome messages in this notebook,

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,389
where instead of blank paper you're given
blank New York City walls and trucks

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,459
that your notes and doodles can deface.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,938
As a final escape from modern technology,
transform your iPhone 4

31
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:53,519
into an old leather book and then enter the future

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,839
with this amazing Levitron I found on Vat19. 
It can hold objects up to

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,949
12 ounces

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,249
and automatically adjusts when they move
or change weight.

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,688
Here's a wine stopper that makes the
bottle look like a message in a bottle,

36
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,969
but if you prefer your potent portables quantifiable,

37
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,679
use this glass, which has markings
designating exact servings

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,449
of spirits, beer and wine. 
Beastie Boys action figures,

39
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,139
a spoon action figure, a miniature camera
that's a USB flash drive

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,999
and a flash drive that's... fresh.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,669
Beans can be fun when they come in a can.

42
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,409
Water this and when the seed grows
it'll sprout with a message written on

43
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:32,889
it.

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,809
If you live in or near London,
I'm gonna be there this weekend

45
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,208
at Summer in the City. It's an awesome
get together for cool people

46
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,669
and cool YouTubers
and if you can make it, I'll be there -

47
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,259
Vsauce unite. Speaking of Vsauce,

49
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,799
