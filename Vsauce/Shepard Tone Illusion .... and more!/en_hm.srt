00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,398
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today I released a brand new

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,769
Vsauce Leanback. A playlist of
educational videos from all over YouTube

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,808
that I think are cool

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,079
and I host sort of like a Vsauce TV show.
You can start that by clicking the box up in

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,808
the corner

6
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:17,319
or the link at the top of this video's
description. But before that,

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,879
I wanna talk about the Shepard tone.
It's a sound

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,618
made out of multiple sine waves that
play a trick on us.

9
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,938
See, what they do is continuously rise in pitch

10
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:31,149
and then every so often one of them
drops down an octave,

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,189
but our brains don't perceive that because
the other two

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,539
continue rising and cover for it.
The sine waves take turns dropping down an

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,169
octave,

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,709
producing a sonic barber pole, a noise

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,988
that appears to keep rising in pitch for
ever and ever

16
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:58,279
without ever actually going anywhere.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,729
I was reminded of it this week by
FallingFalling.com,

18
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,348
a creation of Internet artist New Rafael,
where the Shepard tone

19
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,719
seems to go down and fall forever.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,899
Rafael also made some other cool sites,
like OutInTheWind.com.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,489
Here, there's nothing except for dismissing

22
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,399
wind that slowly erodes your cursor. Okay, now
some of you may already know this, but in

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,029
America

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,109
we say "ADIdas," whereas the rest of the world says

25
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,199
"adiDAS." And no, it does not stand for "all
day I dream about soccer."

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,799
That's just a backronym, an acronym made
up for a word that already exists.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,529
Instead, it's named after a person, which
is why people pronounce "adiDAS."

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,228
It's named after Adi Dassler, a German guy
who got in a fight with his brother,

29
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,809
so his brother rude off, went across the
river and started his own athletic company,

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,879
known as PUMA.
That's right. Adidas

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,368
and Puma came from the same town,
from the same

32
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:57,419
family. Finally, before the Leanback, I
wanna share this USB typewriter with you.

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,659
It's a really cool device

34
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,049
that plugs into your computer and works
like a normal keyboard, except at the

35
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,219
same time

36
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,209
it keeps a hard copy for your records.
It even works with an iPad.

37
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,569
Alright, now it's time to watch the
Vsauce Leanback. You can click here

38
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,219
to start it.

39
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,139
I'll meet you over there.

40
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,299
And as always,

41
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,480
thanks for watching.
