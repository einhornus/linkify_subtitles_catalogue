00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,099
Justin Bieber without eyebrows and a hungry

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,179
shirt.
It's episode 42 of IMG!

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,359
The lines on the carpet of this game
store produce the illusion of pockets and

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,198
dips. If you're still not dizzy,
take a swig from your Full House

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,959
flask and then wall down a poppy sandwich

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,118
or eat a cat or go to New York

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,719
and get yourself a big cat.
But let's be honest,

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,489
what you really want is a team of cats that serves

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,799
as your hair,
because the only thing more delicious

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,639
than cat boogers are panda boogers.
This

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,099
image never seems to end, nor does this
one, where a picture was taken

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,779
every hour and held next to the next
hour. The world's least portable

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,139
MP3 player at least makes more sense than this,

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,898
though it's all trumped by chair-chair.

15
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,939
Skull chair.
Obama and Biden

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,049
love watching IMG!
Maybe they like my beard,

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,348
'cause if so, they should know about the best beard

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,319
ever.
If you extrapolate a Barbie doll's proportions

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,359
to a woman six feet tall, she would look

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,429
like this. Oh, sorry, no, no, no, she would
look like

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:31,329
this. And now, thanks to BuzzFeed,
pictures taken at just the right moment

22
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,109
Here's a rainbow cleverly organizing all the colors

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,559
offered by Crayola since 1903.
At first,

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,219
you have these 8 colors,
but as time went on, the colors branched,

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,419
divided, more and more were offered.
And on the actual site,

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,618
you can mouse over each color for its official name.

27
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:51,669
This infographic is also neat.
The highest to the lowest. It shows

28
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,019
altitude above the death zone,
where humans can't breathe,

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,669
all the way down to Denver, Colorado,
the world's tallest building,

30
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,019
under sea levels to the Midnight zone,
the wreckage of the Titanic

31
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,268
and deeper. Oh, and here's one that breaks
down the stats behind

32
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:11,609
the words used on the Beatles'
"Abbey Road" album.

33
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,419
Teach your kids the importance of athletics. No!

34
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,869
Ffffound.com showed me some sweet pics -

35
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,369
Atari, Atari, fire heart.

36
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,589
In London this morning,
on my way to work, I beat

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,299
the universe by finding the Waldo family reunion.

38
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,699
They have great vehicle registration
plates here across the pond and no, no, no, no,

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,069
not that one. This one. But seriously,
their numbering scheme is interesting, so if

40
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,119
you want something to geek out about today,

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,339
go learn it.
And, as we exit, let's look at

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,619
"an exit," a guy running to the door...

43
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,279
Or maybe it's a flying man

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,459
wearing a cape, with a giant...

45
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,579
And as always,

46
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,760
thanks for watching.
