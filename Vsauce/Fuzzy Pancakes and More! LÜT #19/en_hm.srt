1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,059
Macaroni and cheese scented air fresheners
and bacon and egg earrings.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,999
It's episode 19 of LÃœT.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,428
This clock tells the correct time, except

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,459
it runs backwards.
And Thailand Unique will sell you a bottle

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:23,059
of whiskey with a cobra in it, delicious chocolate
covered silkworms, a can of BBQ scorpions

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,899
or a nice bag of edible pregnant crickets.
If the thought of eating bugs leaves you with

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,579
cold feet, make them colder with this snowball
shooting crossbow and then warm them back

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,929
up with these USB powered heated slippers.
Or, show your team spirit with Vat19's giant

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,309
puffy NFL sneaker slippers while feeding your
baby with an Enterprise spoon that can drip

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,869
food all over a flashing LED tricky bib.
Your bib, of course, should be formal.

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,449
Buy a baby rattle that makes your baby look
buff and when they get older don't give them

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,459
army men, give them breakdance men.
Or treat yourself to a cute cuddly stuffed

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,798
animal cupcake, a pistol with a cowboy hat,
a slice of pizza, a stack of pancakes or,

14
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,439
my favourite, the zebra rabbit with a moustache.
Get your lady a pair of hand-painted Star

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,289
Wars shoes or these eye shadows from GeekChic
cosmetics, based on the colours of the Mushroom

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,949
Kingdom.
Oh, and don't forget this shade of lipstick,

17
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,169
it's called Hipster Ariel.
Be even hipper with a levitating lamp that

18
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,008
looks like it's been slashed by a light sabre.
And here's a wire frame you can use to make

19
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:36,828
any chair suggest the idea of a throne.
Ferrofluids are colloids containing magnetic

20
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:42,529
material, so they respond to magnetic fields
and their own cohesion and surface tension.

21
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,739
You can buy a whole play kit or a litter of
the stuff.

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,619
Now, just don't drink it.
Instead, drink some civet coffee.

23
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,599
This coffee is produced by having civets run
around eating the very best beans they find.

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,258
These guys swallow it, digest it and enzymes
in their intestine change the beans, which

25
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:04,799
they poop out completely whole.
So farmers collect the poop, wash it off,

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:12,299
roast the beans and produce for you the best,
smoothest and most expensive coffee on earth.

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,068
Full disclosure - I bought some of this last
year for my dad on Father's Day and it was

28
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,339
delicious.
I'm gonna shout out ScienceBob.

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,039
Now, you Leanbackers know him, his site store
is cool.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,479
He's got smoke shooting guns and smoke guans,
owl pallets that you can dissect to get rat

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,749
bones out of.
Science for the win.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,529
And as always,

33
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,670
thanks for watching.
