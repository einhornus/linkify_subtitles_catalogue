00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,338
Rober De Niro and Rober De Faro and shoelace
love.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,189
It's episode 46 of IMG!
Here's a great infographic about New Year's

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,909
resolutions.
For instance, 88% of them fail.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,098
But you see these images of cats?
They are cat scans.

5
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:26,538
For something sweet, check out SCANDYBARS,
a Tumblr with high-resolution cross sectional

6
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:31,658
scans of candy.
Less appetising is this rare and very real

7
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:37,648
albino shark cyclops.
Kyle Bean took these soft gorilla photographs.

8
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:45,108
A jello hand grenade, a feather knife, brass
knuckles toast and a delicious melting time

9
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,058
bomb.
Almost as delicious as dressing your baby

10
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,079
as a Thanksgiving turkey, a homeless person
or a creeper.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,719
The splash of water caused by a droplet impacting
a pool is called a Worthington jet.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,799
Now the jet can break into droplets, and this
droplet refracting a world map behind it creates

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,889
a globe that blows my mind.
Imgur released the 11 most loaded images on

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,999
their site in 2011.
The most viewed GIF, of course, was the cafeteria ninja.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,289
Behance counted down their site's top 10 most

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,519
appreciated projects.
For instance, honest logos for YouTube, Facebook

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,199
and more.
I also love these brand-versations.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,648
Logos made out of logos from competing products.
Okay, now these works use negative space to

19
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:38,279
make two pictures simultaneously.
This one reminds me of a psychology study

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,019
from the late 1800s, showing how culture influences
perception.

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,889
Western viewers are familiar with box-like
architecture and corners, and so they report

22
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,158
that this image is a family sitting indoors
with a window looking outside.

23
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,529
But participants from East Africa interpreted
the family to be sitting outside under a tree,

24
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,728
while this woman balances a box on her head.
Okay, here's a field of squares.

25
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:10,579
Now, follow the moving dot and the middle
squares will appear to rise and fall.

26
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:26,679
And you know what?
How about some finger drawings?

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,499
Here's a human Santapede and here's something
neat.

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,959
Jodi Benson.
She did the voice for Ariel in The Little

29
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,839
Mermaid and she's the same person who does
the voice for Barbie in Toy Story.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,819
Now this image of the world shows global cloud
cover averaged over the month of October 2009.

31
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,119
But clouds are more fun when they're in weird
shapes or positions.

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,919
Speaking of clouds, let's talk about William
Rankin, a marine corp pilot who ejected from

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,068
his failing aircraft and sky dove right through
the middle of a thunderstorm.

34
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,988
Fluctuating pressure in the storm set off
his automatic parachute early and he was tossed

35
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:10,259
around inside the thunderclouds, more than
10,000 feet above the ground, for more than

36
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:17,839
40 minutes before finally landing in a tree.
But Reddit alerted me to scarier weather.

37
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,319
The weather over the USA on December 27, a
T-Rex about to eat Iowa.

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,419
Now finally, these books have been carved
into landscapes by Guy Laramee.

39
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,679
On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming you can submit
your own images, DONGs, questions and generally

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,219
Vsauce at all together.
For instance, Jonathan submitted these carved

41
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,219
books that together make a tree, which is
what they started out as anyways.

42
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,139
And as always,

43
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,660
thanks for watching.
