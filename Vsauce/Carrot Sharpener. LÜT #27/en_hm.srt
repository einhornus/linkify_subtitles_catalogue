1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,099
Why would anybody peel a carrot when they
could use an oversized pencil sharpener built

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,199
just for them?
And the same goes for cigarette...pencils.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,619
It's episode 27 of LÜT.
For pencils that are more musical, grab yourself

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,809
a pair of drumstick pencils.
And David Bizer records the waveform of a

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,009
word or phrase you speak and then makes this,
whose pieces you can pop out to make your

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,129
own waveform into a necklace.
He's also published instructions on how to

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,609
make your own for free.
Now, brass knuckles are a more useful form

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,999
of jewellery, especially when you upgrade
to the kind that's also a taser.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,379
Projectile defences improve by using a target
dummy, so you better choose the bleeding zombie

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,959
target.
This brain-eater will actually bleed when

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,339
hit.
You can rub it in by wearing a Kentucky Fried

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:00,219
Brains t-shirt or this one, which reminds
all of us that zombies ar...were people too.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,999
Now keep your hair tidy with periodic table
barrettes and make some customized art right

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,979
away with myDaVinci[.com].
With one click you can personalize and order

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,719
prints just the way you want them.
Now, while photos and lockets are romantic,

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,029
this Mystery Science Theatre 3000 frame pendant
makes whatever photo you put in it that much

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,029
more hilarious.
Stay safe and bright with monkey lights, a

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,539
brilliant array of LEDs for your bike tires
that can display patterns while you ride.

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,339
If it's a chilly bike ride you're taking,
be sure to wear these matching lobster gloves

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,699
and hat.
Food time.

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,749
Use this mold to bake a 1-up cupcake and decorate
food with goggly eyes, that you can eat.

22
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,089
Season the rest of your food with some salt
and pepper shakers gnome butt.

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,709
Or if you feline like it, use these shakers
that look like cat butts.

24
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:59,539
Now, cats also love couches,
so get yourself a cat tunnel couch.

25
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,999
If you've upgraded from a cat to baby, don't
carry it like a square.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,639
Stick your kid in a baby holster like a real cowboy.

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,279
You know, like the kind that ride on dogs.
Feeling handy?

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,259
Paint the house with electrically conductive
paint and install this power-up plate on top

29
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,439
of your switches to control your lights with
buttons and a joystick.

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,639
You can install the whole thing with a handgun drill.

31
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,559
And then go to the hardware store to cut this
rude key into something useful.

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,659
The labyrinth aquarium is a mansion for sealife,
but don't count out owning this one you can

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,929
fill with actual jellyfish they sell you.
Even scarier is a jack-o'-lantern with pumpkin

34
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,098
teeth.
Your pumpkin will feel beautiful.

35
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:52,438
So next, raise your own self-esteem by using
self deprecating golf balls from TheCheeky[.com].

36
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,878
They contain phrases like "we both know that
shot was my fault."

37
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,918
Tetris is kind of like putting together a
puzzle, which makes this a puzzle puzzle.

38
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:09,068
ThinkGeek[.com] offers a pack of 566 digit magnets,
which you can use to spell things out like

39
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:14,088
an old calculator, but on your fridge, which
might contain soda bottles.

40
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:19,299
But why not replace them with Vat19[.com]'s
giant cola gummies?

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,519
The only thing more luxurious is a slide for
your yacht, which you, of course, captain

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,559
while wearing a pair of 24 carat gold-dipped
NIKE's, while sipping tea brewed with your

43
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,939
TIE fighter Death Star infuser.
But don't do these things alone.

44
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,879
Be watched by these ominous security cameras,
that are actually a lamp.

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,239
In this notebook, your doodles and scribblings
become automatic tattoo art.

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,598
And even trash can be useful.
Like these playing cards Metrodeck makes out

47
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,599
of discarded subway cards.
Your furniture can contain optical illusions,

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,818
like these cracked cabinets or perspective
curtains that close off a room while presenting

49
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,459
what looks like lies behind them.
Here's a table that is a bad dog.

50
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,659
And the glass sides of this chair make it
look impossibly balanced from the side.

51
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,139
In the same way that letters on the street
are elongated, so you can read them from a

52
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,778
shallow angle,
so are the numbers on Tokyoflash's newest watch.

53
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:25,379
From above, it looks like almost nothing.
And, of course, because Tokyoflash is so saucy,

54
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,299
using code VSTF gets you $10 off.
All of those things are really cool and you

55
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,399
could find out more by clicking links in this
video's description.

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,529
Of course, Vsauce also has a Facebook page,
a Twitter page and as they say in Poland...

57
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,529
Jak zawsze, dziękujemy za oglądanie.
[And as always, thanks for watching.]

58
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,979
Vsauce cupcakes!
