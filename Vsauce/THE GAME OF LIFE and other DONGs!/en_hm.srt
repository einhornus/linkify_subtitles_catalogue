00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,658
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here with some things you can do

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,298
online now, guys.
Let's start the DONGs off in the right hands

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:14,079
with misternicehands.com.
You can pull his finger.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,209
Wordle.net

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,538
analyzes text, like on a web site,
and generates a free

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,049
word cloud with fun sizes correlating to
the frequency with which the words

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,079
are used. Pretty awesome, right?
But is it the most

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,129
awesomest thing ever dot com ?

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,179
The site pits two things against each
other and lets you vote on which of the

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,019
two things

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,869
is awesome.
For instance, pilgrims versus Andrew Jackson.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,718
I'm gonna have to go with pilgrims.
But periodic table

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,339
or Orson Welles? Which is awesomer?
Okay, it's tough, but I'm gonna have to go with

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,359
Mendeleev.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,729
Now, the site tabulates everyone's answers
and runs a list

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,109
of what people currently consider to be
the most awesome.

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,319
Notice that right now, life is being beat

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,659
by the Internet. 
Got a song stuck in your head?

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,438
Go to unhearit.com, a site dedicated to playing

20
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,868
equally catchy songs,
with the hope of removing the one

21
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,469
that's stuck in your head.
And if you like what you hear, check out

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,599
TuneGlue. Type in a band to add them to
the field and then expand them

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,319
to see other bands related.
Now, I also like Music-Map,

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,269
where you can enter a musician's name
and other bands orbit them at distances

25
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,899
related to how similar their styles are.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,489
If you're tired of music recognition
programs that don't allow you to sing

27
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,359
your own song or

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,758
hum, enter midomi.com.
It's still not perfect,

29
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,089
but I am terrible and Midomi still

30
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,609
understood what I was trying to do.
"I won't loose a baby,

31
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,209
so why don't you kill me?"
Amazing.

32
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,079
Another flawless performance by Michael Stevens.

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,908
ThunderShark78 introduced me to Fracuum,

34
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,019
a series of mazes you continually shrink down

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,099
into.
The perspective is pretty cool.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,849
Now let's get mathematical with Conway's

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,149
Game of Life. This one's a doozy, but
it's really famous. Right now I'm playing

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,299
it as a downloadable version for PC, Mac or Linux,

39
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,729
known as "Golly."
So, the game itself

40
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,488
is simply a grid that I can fill in and whether a cell

41
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:25,449
is alive or dead determines what the next

42
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,488
generation will look like.
What made this game so famous

43
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:32,919
is that using just a few deterministic
rules, we're able to create some quite

44
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,089
complex

45
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,799
things.
Now classically, the rules are very

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,889
simple. The fate of a cell depends on the
status of its 1,

47
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,659
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 neighbors.

48
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,609
If two or three cells surround it,

49
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,738
it's gonna be fine, it's going to
continue to live. But if fewer than two,

50
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,518
or if more than three exist around it,
it will die of isolation or

51
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,679
overcrowding.
Now, likewise, if

52
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,268
a dead empty cell has 3, exactly three neighbors,

53
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,708
it will come to life.
So the next generation of this shape

54
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,999
looks like this.
It's amazing how just a few

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,559
simple deterministic rules can allow you to create

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,658
shapes like this one, known as a glider, which

57
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,239
across successive generations actually locomotes.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,749
Oh, and GMSlash showed me a version where the cells

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,979
are mushrooms, and the longer a cell
lives, the bigger the mushroom gets.

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,318
But what's a game of life without love?

61
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,559
Themediabuffs sent me pretentious game,
a wonderful interactive poem that's

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,529
touching, but aware of itself.
And Connor showed me an even more tragic love,

63
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,669
a game where you play a guy in love

64
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,889
with a zombie.
Get her to follow you,

65
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,199
but keep her in a cage.
Also cute is Night

66
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,238
of the Loving Dead. You play a skeleton who
must find his body parts to reunite

67
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,958
with his true love.
As you acquire organs, like your brain,

68
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,059
you can begin to use new powers.
Now, if you're not

69
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,389
in love with a zombie and would prefer
to prepare for their attack,

70
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,449
TheArzonite offers you Map of the Dead,

71
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,828
a global Google Map delineating areas
where zombie activity will likely be

72
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,539
highest

73
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,739
in the event of an outbreak. It includes
helpful landmarks, like nearby food and

74
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,869
ammunition shops,

75
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,869
so you can plan your strategy now.
If this is all a bit too scary for you,

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,758
relax with N3xTB0y's

77
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,039
z0r.de, a collection of quick looping images

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,089
and silly music. Shantuku discovered this neat interactive scale of the universe tool.

79
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,769
We've covered things like this before,
but you can never have enough.

80
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,758
While we're out in space,
let's get bigger plane cosmic crush,

81
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,019
like Amonfobious'. Collide with smaller
items to grow larger and avoid

82
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,079
giant dangerous celestial objects.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,429
Here on YouTube, Vixolent uploaded
a really well-made interactive

84
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,649
game. You play within a single video and
his use of annotations is quite

85
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,369
ingenious.
And TheRealMcJoni made this impressive interactive

86
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,138
domino video.
The tricks and layout are really neat

87
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,749
and you get to choose a direction at the
end of the video - let's hope it's the

88
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,239
right one.

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,739
Back to Metronomy.
Subscribe to Vsauce for more.

90
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,839
And as always,

91
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,480
thanks for watching.
