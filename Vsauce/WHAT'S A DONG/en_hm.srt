00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,058
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here, next to a giant bird,

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,778
which can only mean one thing.
I'm in London, where even the pillows

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:12,038
say "God save the Queen." It's a cushion, Michael.
Alright, look.

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,238
I've got a bird trying to tell me what to say.
That's right, in England

5
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,369
this is a bird and this is a bird.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,369
Of course, I call her Hazel.
But I've got a piece of knowledge for you,

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,899
Hazel. It's a new word and the word is DONG.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,549
DONG.
Is that

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,759
something you eat?
No. It's things you do online now guys.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,078
Iambebeast recommended Musicovery,

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,088
an awesome site with a mood pad.
Mouse over the pad to choose you current or

12
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,209
desired mood

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,268
and it immediately changes.
You can even focus it on a decade or genre

14
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,768
within your mood. But if you want
complete control, upload your own favorite

15
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,078
song to Pixel White,

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,018
like you Ulication. The game lasts as
long as the song you upload

17
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,019
and the songs' equalizer bars become the
plane space.

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,768
Dizquier91 brought up a list of sites,

19
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:05,419
where you can waste time like a professional.
While I was there,

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,859
I found Nooooooooooooooo.com.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,599
When something terrible happens,

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,649
go there and push the button.

23
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,299
I also discovered ooooiiii.com.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,709
The title makes more sense after you go
there. But if you want TheCasalex's

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,089
computerception,

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,239
play a game where you're on a computer.

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,469
Or Coachhere recommends a game with state of the art

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,978
ASCII graphics. You're a Rafflecopter
dropping WTF bombs

29
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,069
on guys wearing roller skates.
Too fancy?

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,549
Well, play this even simpler game programmed to
happen inside your URL bar.

31
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,829
Use the arrow keys to move the "O" to
lasso A's

32
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,169
and press the spacebar to kill as many
as possible in 30 seconds.

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,618
PointlessSites is another good
collection of places. While I was there

34
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,419
I found one billion mazes, a site that literally

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,148
has 1,000,000,000 mazes. If you solved
one maze every single second,

36
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,779
it would take you more than 31 years to
finish them all.

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,539
Speaking of long times, here's a YouTube
video of a guy counting to 100

38
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,749
thousand and yeah, that says 74 hours.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:23,079
41, 42, 43.

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,799
44, 45.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,409
But to feel really sad, play Platform

42
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,738
and learn a life lesson.
Videos, do you want more?

43
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,979
Well, this one is a really sweet playlist
containing the first

44
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,149
hour of MTV as it originally aired with

45
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,509
the original commercials. And lately I've
been working with Greg from Dr. Coolsex

46
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,889
and getting into his WTF series.
Each week

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,349
we learn a little bit more about what
happened or what's happen...

48
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,179
...ing. You be the judge. And if you're in
London, I hope to see you at Summer in the

49
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,119
City tomorrow.

50
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,079
And as always,

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,400
thanks for watching.
