00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,439
Shooting a watermelon off your brother's
head and an inverted sandwich.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,038
I'm a little sick today,
but the best medicine is episode 37

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,139
of IMG!

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,539
Why is this cat so sad? Does he not
know that unicorn bicycles exist?

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,278
The only thing more spectacular
might be this 'Jaws'

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,569
themed swimsuit with The Little Mermaid
as the victim.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,438
Or maybe the answer is this bubble.
What do you think, shocked barn?

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,459
Huh, always surprised. 
Well, this toilet thought it was funny

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,909
and, as usual, chocolate chip cookie's just
grumpy. But it could be because someone

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,509
just threw

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,959
acid on his wife's face.
It's not funny, bag.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,339
MoIllusions.com featured a tree's
shadow that produces a

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,269
face. Of course, some shadows prefer
beer pong. I mean, like, they really

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,549
love it.
Reflections can be just as naughty.

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,959
This word became "nude."
But whatever,

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,529
the final boss of the Internet prefers
dogs making awkward smiles.

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:14,688
Enjoy.

18
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,728
On DeviantArt Katie created out of this world lips,

19
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,008
a sunset face and eyes based on the Lion King

20
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,469
and Alice in Wonderland.
But now, what the H is

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,809
this?
Oh. A mirror

22
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,639
lake.
This graffiti uses its surface creatively

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,868
and here's a real-life angry bird attack.
This tree looks like it has teeth, a tongue and

24
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:41,459
vomit.
And this shirt makes your arm a horse neck.

25
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,829
Researchers in China are trying to reintroduce
captive bred

26
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,398
pandas into the wild without wild
pandas knowing the difference.

27
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,779
Their solution? Dress up like pandas,
which leads to awesome pictures

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,728
like these. Heart hair. On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming

29
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,719
Avery did some important math.
And Raman added this illusion,

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,228
where your brain can't help but see the
two groups shake around,

31
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,888
even though they're not moving.

33
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,289
And as always,

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,810
thanks for watching.
