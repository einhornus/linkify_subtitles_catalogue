00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,909
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,309
yawning.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,149
Why do we yawn and why is yawning contagious?

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,789
How come when I see someone yawn or even
think about it it makes me

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,939
kinda of want to yawn?
First things first, definitions.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,109
When you yawn, you inhale air and

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,799
stretch your ear drums.
That's why your ears pop when you yawn.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,519
Now, if you yawn and at the same time
stretch your whole body,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,189
that is called pandiculation.
A common misconception about

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,449
yawning is that people yawn
when they need more air,

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,659
more oxygen.
But studies have shown that no matter how much

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,819
oxygen is in the air around a person,
they won't yawn more or less frequently.

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,219
And when people exercise
and their bodies do, in fact,

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,299
need more oxygen, they don't yawn more often.

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,979
Instead, research has shown that our
first answer most likely lies

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,529
in being cool.
When you are

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,129
exhausted, tired, deep brain

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,158
temperatures increase, but your brain is
like a computer - it operates best

19
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,669
at a very specific temperature.
And so yawning,

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,099
bringing all this outside air in through
your ears and your mouth,

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,709
cools your facial blood and actually
helps cool down

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,868
your brain.
This phenomenon is particularly easy to observe

23
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:33,678
when parakeets yawn. Researchers have
found that parakeets only yawn within a

24
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,849
very specific range of temperatures.

25
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,038
Too cold outside and yawning will cool
the brain too much.

26
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:44,008
Too hot and yawning will actually warm
it up. Parakeets are perfect test

27
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,298
subjects for this effect,

28
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,578
because they yawn just like you and me,
except they don't exhibit

29
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,188
contagious yawn.
If you show a person a video of other people

30
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,428
yawning, it's likely that the person
watching will yawn

31
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:00,748
his or herself, unless you put an

32
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:04,529
ice pack on their forehead, keeping their brain cooler.

33
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,969
Seriously. The University of Albany has
found that people contagiously yawn

34
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,809
less frequently when they have
ice packs on their head,

35
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,909
which means that yawning to cool your brain

36
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,579
isn't just for the birds.
Studies have shown that

37
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,289
yawning also increases blood pressure, stretches

38
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,779
facial muscles and increases focus.

39
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,958
When you panticulate, you stretch

40
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,378
all of your muscles, making them better
ready to be used

41
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:37,488
at any moment.
So when it comes to a herd of prey animals,

42
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,098
contagious yawning make sense,
because a herd that

43
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,328
yawns together stays alert together.

44
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:48,199
Under this theory, yawning is advantageously

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,438
contagious, because that first
animal to yawn

46
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,268
acts as a sort of reminder to the rest
of the herd to keep themselves

47
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:00,318
ready and alert. But, of course, when we say that yawning is contagious, we don't mean

48
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:00,708
like

49
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,348
a disease.
Instead, it's a bit more closely related

50
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,459
to empathy.

51
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,559
Sympathy is when you are
concerned for others, where you wish

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,468
someone was better off.
Empathy is the ability to

53
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:18,859
recognize and share the emotions that other people

54
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,488
feel. 
Emotional contagion is when

55
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,899
the emotions of people around you
influence the way you feel

56
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,238
without you even having to separate
yourselves from them, like when

57
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,318
being around happy people lifts your spirits or how

58
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,268
anger and fear can lead to mob mentality.
Now,

59
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,259
children with autism, who exhibit
impaired social interaction and

60
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,438
communication,

61
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,499
yawn less frequently than other children

62
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,899
when viewing videos of people yawning.
So,

63
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,378
is yawning an emotional contagion or is it about

64
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:54,468
empathy?
Well last year, the University of Pisa

65
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:57,708
found that yawn contagiousness is greatest with

66
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,708
family and then friends and then

67
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,108
acquaintances and lastly strangers.

68
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,869
And a study at Leeds University brought
in participants to take a test that

69
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,649
measured how

70
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,858
empathetic they were.
But before the test began,

71
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:16,849
amongst them was one person
who worked for the researchers

72
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,169
and this person yawned
every minute for 10 minutes.

73
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,799
Interestingly, the people who wound up
scoring the highest

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,359
on the empathy test were also the ones
who contagiously yawned along

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,899
the most.
Let's talk more about animal

76
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,829
yawning. What fascinates me so much is that
animals across many species

77
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,939
all yawn, but they do so for different reasons.

78
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,099
Animals like guinea pigs and some monkeys yawn

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,649
to intimidate and show their sharp scary teeth.

80
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,609
Some penguins yawn to attract mates 
and when snakes yawn,

81
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,559
it seems to be about realigning their
jaws and opening their tracheas

82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,589
to breathe better after a big body
disfiguring

83
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,399
meal.
Fish yawn more frequently when water

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,899
oxygen levels are low or water heat levels

85
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,659
are high. So, when you yawn you're
participating in the behavior shared

86
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,339
across all kinds of animals,

87
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,948
but most likely you're yawning for
purposes unique to your species -

88
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:26,359
us humans.

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,719
What's really cool is that

90
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,348
yawning is most likely an ancient signal
telling the rest of us humans

91
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:36,588
"let's do this, let's survive."

92
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,388
And as always,

93
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:38,449
thanks for watching.
