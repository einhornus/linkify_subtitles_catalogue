1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,059
Can you find the hidden giraffe?
And this cat doesn't need glasses.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,959
It's episode 48 of IMG!

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,959
Bobby Neel Adams takes a photo of a person

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,579
as a child and then has them replicate the
pose as an adult.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,179
He then rips the photos to fit.
The effect is haunting and cool.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,559
But this is just lonely.
Pareidolia is when you see something of significance,

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,108
a face, a pattern, in something random.
But if you put the face there, you're like

8
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,369
gnomers.
Prefer dogs?

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,369
Well, Buzzfeed showed off the scariest dog
pictures possible and to alleviate your fear,

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,569
here is Maddie the Dog.
On things.

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,908
Maddieonthings.com
Name brand arm tattoos are a smart idea and

12
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:57,689
so is eating healthy.
Wait, whaaat... is this guy so excited about?

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,248
Hmmm.
I also don't know what's going on here and

14
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:05,789
okay, I guess we'll have to remove all the
art inside.

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,669
ThumbPress brought us a subway map of rock'n'roll,
which genres and intersections do bands exist

16
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,729
on.
They also showed us how not to be a good parent,

17
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,999
though a leaf blower to the face is pretty
fun.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,019
Thousands of Braille products, many of which
you've never... seen before?

19
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,839
These items cast the shadow of a city and
these glass paper aeroplanes cast a combined

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,099
shadow that resembles a city on the bay.
Oh, and these water bottles add definition

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,659
and shading to cast the shadow of a man's face.

22
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:44,439
Photographer Hal takes photographs of couples
shrink-wrapped in plastic.

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,479
He must act quickly or they'll suffocate.
Seriously, this is real.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,199
As are these celebrity names.
Jon Stewart's real name is John Leibowitz.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,589
Ralph Lauren's original name was Ralph Lipschitz.
But the craziest of them all?

26
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,089
Michael J. Fox.
His actual, original name, and I'm not kidding,

27
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,369
is Michael A. Fox.
But now, Chevrolet's speedometer designs from

28
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,069
1941 to 2011.
Now where is this guy on TV looking?

29
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,239
Mmmhm.
Well, what about him?

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,399
Oh, come on!
TV people even photobomb kids kissing.

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,019
See?
Bread shoes.

32
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,139
Remember those scary dogs?
Well, dogs and cats can also be loving companions.

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:41,599
Enjoy.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,839
Now here's a question.

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,708
How big is a million dollars?
I mean, what would having a million dollars

36
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,869
look like?
According to this great study, it's only about

37
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,309
5 reams worth of paper.
Heavy, but enough to carry around yourself,

38
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,658
if you used $100 bills.
This, however, is what 206 million dollars

39
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:06,059
in cash looks like.
About the size of a king mattress.

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,708
Painting on brick is one thing, but letting
it drip like rain is another.

41
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,888
Sam3's street art asks the question, "when
you look into the sky, what's looking back

42
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,238
at you?"
Now, if you're afraid of getting caught painting

43
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,799
on buildings, do it like this.
Jim Denevan goes even larger.

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,488
By driving around on a dry lake bed, very
very exactly, he manages to carve mathematically

45
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,498
impressive circles into the Nevada landscape.
Large enough to be seen from space, but temporary

46
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:39,999
enough to be quickly washed away by rain and wind.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,599
MoIllusions had this this week.
A blue shape that seems to tick every time

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,659
the gap between the red and blue shapes disappears,
though the blue shape never moves.

49
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,839
It's caused by ambiguous figure-ground segregation.
Eric Tabuchi went on a French-American road

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,879
trip, finding stores with American city names
without having to leave France.

51
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,589
Or his own bedroom.
The entire book isn't photographs, it's Google

52
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,448
Street View screenshots he took on his computer.
With the Internet, why go anywhere?

53
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:20,528
Tabuchi also collected the alphabet from trucks.
Now, planking is too flat.

54
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:27,939
We want twists and turns.
You know, like Takanori's bonsai trees houses.

55
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,249
Finally, David Aday cuts pictures of people
into fun little shapes and then pins them

56
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,409
to walls to make the person complete again.
Except in a separated kind of way.

57
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,469
Follow us on Facebook and Twitter for more.

58
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,309
And as always,

59
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,730
thanks for watching.
