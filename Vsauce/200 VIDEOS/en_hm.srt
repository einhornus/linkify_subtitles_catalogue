00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:02,299
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,019
And we now have 200 videos.
So, to celebrate, I'm going to recommend some

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,819
videos.
200 of them, inside playlists, especially

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,548
ones that you guys have been submitting to
me.

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,659
But to begin, let's go all the way back to
the start.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,779
Or, more correctly, the RestartPage.com.
I found this on Boing Boing.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,659
The page contains dialog boxes from operating
systems through history.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,899
Click one and your entire browser recreates
the actual restart.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,179
But if you want to be more involved, be like
Suckmynose000, who recommended this visualization

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,399
of "Lights," where you can fly around in electrically
synchronised world of lights.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,039
2MoronsAndAnIdiot sent me "Perfect Eyesight."
How accurately can you click in the exact

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,788
right spot?
For instance, the exact mathematical middle

13
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,689
of this star.
Nice.

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,209
Now, I've covered so many playlists before.
For instance this one, containing the very

15
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,518
first hour of MTV ever.
Well, a couple of days ago, CGPGrey released

16
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:10,199
this winning playlist of his 30 favorite videos,
ranging from comedy to art to music to science

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,259
to horror.
It's an amazing collection of cool stuff that

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,279
also let's you get closer to Grey.
RealNintendo put together this playlist of

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,729
7 epic game show fails.
He says they get crazier as it goes, so keep

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,969
watching.
Hunter F. Davies made 4 playlists: Funny 911

21
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,699
Calls, Great Explosions, 7 incredible historical
Apple ads and 3 videos about why the world

22
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,459
won't end in 2012.
Now, here's a great one.

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,409
28 commercials for video game systems in order
from 1973 to 2011.

24
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,629
Maddog53 collected his 15 favorite YouTube
videos of 2011, many of which were new to

25
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,789
me and are quite beautiful.
MrBeanmachine17 assembled 7 incredible nuclear

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,989
bomb detonation videos in order of increasing
explosive yield.

27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,499
But if you'd rather relax, check out this
community - driving videos.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,679
Sped up footage of people driving their cars
through freeway systems in lots of different

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,918
states.
It's actually pretty cool to have on full

30
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,789
screen in the background like moving artwork.
I received this playlist of cool music and

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,128
was reminded of Hadouken's "People Are Awesome."
So I made this playlist containing 5 of the

32
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,068
best made People Are Awesome clips ever.
We may not have claws or beaks or tails, but

33
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,748
at least we can do this.
Want more inspiration?

34
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:34,998
Grevejp44 sent me this playlist of epic orchestral
arrangements - be sure to play it when preparing

35
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,219
for battle.
Oh and here's a thing.

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,869
You know when you see "As Seen On" on YouTube?
Well, you can click it and arrive on a page

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,729
showing every YouTube video that site has
featured and you can even subscribe to their feed.

38
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,369
So rather than figure out all the channels
worth following yourself, heck, let Reddit

39
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,769
do the work for you.
Or, Cute Overload.

40
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,809
Or a sub-reddit that will deliver video meant
to non-plus your mind.

41
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,949
The new YouTube channel layout makes people's
feeds fantastic automatic playlists.

42
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,449
See, rather than having to find other videos
related by keywords, I can find things related

43
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,328
because the same human liked them.
For instance, I love sword dancing, but related

44
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,279
videos only give me more swords and a girl
in a tanktop.

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,578
But by opening the video from 'temperature3's'
feed, I get this module, which introduces me

46
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,419
to other things that he liked or favorited.
Now, the same goes for my friend Jake's personal

47
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,828
channel.
His list of favorites and likes is like going

48
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:36,399
to cool things wing of the Jake Museum and
Jake is the museum's curator.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,559
If you've made a playlist of types of videos
you think we should all know about, keep them

50
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,119
coming my way - michael@vsauce.com.

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,339
And as always,

52
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,700
thanks for watching.
