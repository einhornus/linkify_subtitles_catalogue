1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,149
A telephoto lens with the tripod for
your iPhone and soap

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,239
shaped like a piece of poop.
It's episode 23

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,279
of LÜT.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,948
Wake up in your warm Nintendo knee-high
socks and put on your fancy superhero

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,759
bow-tie, along with these sunglasses from
Spencer's with a neat

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,039
hanging mustache.
Then, climb a rock wall

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,399
installed so that when you fall you just
take a dive. And this fire pit...

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,399
it's shaped like the world.
Squirrel mask.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,199
Now, what's this?
Oh, nice

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,459
a Spock bath robe.
They've also got Captain Kirk,

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,979
but minimal superheroes now come on t-shirts.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,209
Of course, this t-shirt makes you look rich.
Except by rich,

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,539
I mean geeky. I was kidding. Here's a
nice mug to get for your friend.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,459
Again,

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,629
I was kidding. Keep the table safe with
giant Scrabble coasters

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,179
and keep your lips moist with unicorn
farts lip balm flavored like cotton

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,729
candy

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,318
and spearmint. These aren't for sale,
but check out normal stuffed animals

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,829
bought second-hand, inverted and then
made into cute inside-out cuddly animals.

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,249
You also can't buy this pancake quilt
with bacon accessory, because it's sold

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:15,689
out,

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,728
so keep the bacon sweet with VAT19's

23
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,219
bacon pops.
Hard candy infused with bacon bits

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,979
or be sweeter with a candy necklace
flavored like bacon.

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,329
Back to pancakes.
Williams-Sonoma offers molds to make Star Wars

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,429
shaped pancakes and if you have $50

27
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,798
and an out of this world taste, pick up some
exquisite gourmet chocolates

28
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,908
shaped like the planets.
Or

29
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,239
go darker with these anatomically
accurate skulls

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,609
made of chocolate. Here's a fluffy nuclear
mushroom cloud that's actually a lamp.

31
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,079
Shapeways.com

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,149
also offers a necklace sporting a loop
made of a single curl piece of metal

33
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,859
that locks in a ball or your very own strandbeest,

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,828
a sculpture, that when pushed or pulled

35
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,109
automatically appears to walk.
Oh, and this battle mug

36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,109
has scope rail so you can soup it up
with all your equipment.

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,839
ThisIsWhyImBroke[.com]
pointed me toward a Zelda Sword USB Drive

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,029
and rage base masks.
Pop Chart Lab does it again with this amazing

39
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,958
graph poster of rap names organized by
common themes.

40
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,009
No, I've seen negatively engraved rings before,
but this one

41
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,449
from The Cheeky is great.
All day it pushes against your skin,

42
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,469
so when you try and be sneaky and remove it, your finger carries the mark

43
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,529
"I'm married."
TotusMel creates jewelry

44
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,579
with lace.
One of my favorites is the mask,

45
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,179
but don't forget the ankle corsets. 
Drink some liquid from a can

46
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,939
that's actually a porcelain mug
and then solve puzzles

47
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,359
from V-CUBE.
Not six-sided six-colored ones,

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,979
but two-colored cubes that let you have
a checkerboard shape or my favorite

49
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,738
flag. With two colors, they've got
Poland, Denmark, Finland and Sweden,

50
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,939
but with three colors they've got Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands

51
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,208
and Russia.
Here's an eraser shaped like the evolution of man.

52
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,449
And Japan Trend Shop brings us Ten-Ten Dama.

53
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,579
Like a switch hit, an awesomely designed toy
that when thrown in the air seemingly

54
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,579
magically

55
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,549
inverts itself.
ThinkGeek has Captain Jules'

56
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,619
rings, which unfold into a telescope.

57
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,348
But now for your free thing.
Two things, actually. Cubeecraft[.com]

58
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:37,469
offers free printouts you cut, fold and
glue or tape in the fun characters and

59
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,208
shapes.

60
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,279
Once you've done that make them dance to Mario Paint

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,908
using the composer for PC or Mac just
like the one

62
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,499
in the original SNES game.
RezonerDJ recommended cyber dogs

63
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,379
cybernetic jewelry, like this headset.
And Tokyoflash

64
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,208
offers bizarrely awesome high-tech
watches that look like

65
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,079
things aliens have left behind.
Their newest is like a stencil. See, this one

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,139
says that it's 12:04.

67
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,169
As you may remember, 6 LÜTs ago

68
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,598
I mentioned them. Well, they found out,
thought it was awesome

69
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,119
and now they've set it up, so that until
the end of April if you buy a watch

70
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,357
using code VSTF you get ten dollars off.

71
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,078
So how about that?
Keep being Vsaucy.

72
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,088
And as always,

73
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:22,929
thanks for watching.
