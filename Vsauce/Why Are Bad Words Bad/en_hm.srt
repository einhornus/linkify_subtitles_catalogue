1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,279
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,129
When you call customer service

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,369
and hear this "to ensure quality service

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,449
your call may be monitored or recorded",
they're not kidding.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,838
Over the last year the Marchex Institute
analysed more than 600,000

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,579
recorded phone conversations Americans made

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,479
to businesses in the United States.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,438
Turns out, people from Ohio were the most likely

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
to use curse words - the 'A' word, 
the 'F' word and the 'S' word.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,999
Washington state residents were
the least likely to use bad words.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,069
But what makes

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,549
a word bad?

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,299
Oh, be careful because etymologically speaking

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,509
even the word 'bad' can be considered a bad word.

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,398
It began in old English as a derogatory term

16
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,578
for an effeminate man.
Eighty percent of swear words overheard

17
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,249
in public in 1986, 1997 and 2006

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,359
were essentially the same.
One third of all counts included

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,109
the top two - the 'F' word and the 'S' word.

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,349
Slate's brilliant Lexicon Valley podcast purported that

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,219
these 10 words makeup about 0.7% of the average

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,109
English speakers daily vocabulary, which means

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,228
socially unacceptable words are used almost as often

24
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,728
as socially descriptive words.
First person plural pronouns account for about

25
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:33,308
1% of the words we say everyday.

26
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:36,999
When a bad word is bleeped, it is covered with a 1

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,508
kilohertz sine wave, which sounds like this.

28
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,519
Son of a ...

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,449
By the way, the symbols and
squiggles that are used to represent

30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,078
a bad word have a name.
They're called grawlixes.

31
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,699
They were named by Mort Walker in his seminal

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,868
"The Lexicon of Comicana." 
He names a lot of things but most of

33
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,039
them show stuff, they don't hide stuff.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,109
Why the need to hide bad words, especially if we all

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,299
pretty much know what's being said?
Well, there is no one single reason bad words

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,329
are bad.

37
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,979
Steven Pinker in his excellent lecture
on the topic delineates

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,959
five types of swearing.
First of all, some words are bad

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,179
on purpose.
They are created and/or used with the intent

40
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,489
to hurt others.
He calls this "abusive swearing."

41
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,879
Using words to insult, humiliate, objectify

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,439
or marginalise disfavoured people.

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,819
Now, if that this disfavoured person is

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,389
God, we're talking about supernatural swearing,

45
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,089
which was particularly taboo in Victorian times.

46
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,619
It was believed that casually or vainly referring

47
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,829
to God would physically injure God himself,

48
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,439
literally. So, at the time people were
forced to come up with euphemisms,

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,669
like "Zounds!" and "Gadzooks!", which  originally meant

50
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,179
"God's Wounds!" and "God's Hooks!",

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,969
referring to the nails driven through the hands of Jesus.

52
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,539
Historically, swear words often
came from things we were

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,699
afraid of, things we perceived as dangerous,

54
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,449
stronger than us and mercurial. Such as

55
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,739
death, disease and infirmity, sex

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,479
and sexually transmitted diseases,
as well as body fluids,

57
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,549
germy, gross effluvia. Words

58
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,079
for those gross things became gross
and bad in and of themselves,

59
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,608
uncouth

60
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,269
to speak.

61
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,579
But not all words for gross things are

62
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,629
socially unacceptable, which brings us to Pinker's

63
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,269
second type of swearing - emphatic swearing.

64
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,259
Emphatic swearing is where the
taboo-ness of bad words

65
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,699
becomes quite practical.
You wouldn't usually use those words but when you

66
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,469
really want to convey that your current
emotions matter more to you than proper

67
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,609
social conduct,

68
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,859
you can use them.

69
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,479
Dysphemism.

70
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,349
A euphemism is kind, acceptable word
that allows you to talk about something

71
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,279
unpleasant

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,979
while simultaneously letting everyone know you totally

73
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,639
get that it's unpleasant and want to respect that.

74
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,289
For instance, if you want to be
professional, you wouldn't say s***.

75
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,389
You might say 'defecate'. If, on the other hand,
you really want to drive home just

76
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,379
how unpleasant

77
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,459
the experience was, dysphemisms can help out a lot.

78
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,139
It wasn't a bag of canine defecation you found on your

79
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,189
front porch, it was a s*** bag of hot

80
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,779
dog s***.
Both of these words refer to pretty much the same thing

81
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,439
but they have different levels of
social acceptability and that's

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,529
very helpful. It means word choice allows us to not only

83
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,099
refer to things in the real world but also

84
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,299
to how we feel about them.

85
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,159
If both these words had the same level
of social acceptance

86
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,929
we might even have to find new, badder
words so as not to lose the power

87
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,899
language currently has to express

88
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,559
emotion,

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,459
repulsion and disgust.

90
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,728
But when it comes to two words
referring to the same thing, but

91
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,709
with different levels of social acceptance,
who decides which one's

92
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,109
good and which one's bad?
Well, historically, many of the bad words we

93
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,349
use today

94
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,249
are the result of class differences.

95
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,359
In medieval England, the lower-class Saxons

96
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,549
spoke a Germanic tongue while the upper-class

97
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,119
Normans spoke a language related to French and Latin.

98
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,219
English, as we know it today,
contains many consequences

99
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,189
of their differences. 
The lower class worked with animals and

100
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,698
from them we get animal names. The upper class

101
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:56,709
only ate the animals, which is where
the names of the meat

102
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,879
come from. Today's swear words

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,888
are similar.
Defecation stems from fancy pants

104
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,929
Latin, whereas the less classy s***

105
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,219
is Germanic. There's also idiomatic swearing,

106
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,739
where nothing is being emphasized.

107
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,179
No dysphemism is meant;
instead, it's an easygoing type of

108
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,509
swearing that shows an atmosphere is casual.

109
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,619
Bad words can be used,
we're all close here. It's okay to swear,

110
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,739
we're all cool.

111
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,408
Cathartic swearing

112
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:32,859
is a bit different. It gives us "lalochezia,"

113
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,598
the medical term for the relief swearing provides

114
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,598
when you're in pain. In the brain, swearing

115
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,929
seems to involve different regions
than regular language,

116
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,679
which may explain why people with
aphasia caused by brain damage

117
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,559
struggle to comprehend or construct spoken words

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,589
but yet are fluent at swearing.

119
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,779
Or why people with coprolalia control

120
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,129
normal language just fine, but involuntarily utter

121
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,919
profanity, an obscene words.

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,999
It turns out

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,459
swearing may be centralized in the limbic system,

124
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,939
along with the motions.
Many animals make automatic

125
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,059
noises when in pain or threat to startle or intimidate

126
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,399
attackers, or to let others know what's going on.

127
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,418
In humans, bad words are great for this purpose.

128
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,129
Their taboo-ness makes them special.
People wouldn't use them otherwise,

129
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,158
so they are great alarms. Swearing

130
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,888
is changing.
Some bad words are being used more and more

131
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:38,519
frequently. Of the seven words, George
Carlin said you could never say on

132
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,489
television.

133
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,589
Today, every second

134
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,859
22 of them are sent out on Twitter.

135
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,158
So, what will swearing look like in the future?

136
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,689
It probably won't go away altogether, it's too useful.

137
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,359
But the words we don't like will likely change.

138
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,088
History has shown that as disease
becomes less scary and sex and the

139
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,079
supernatural

140
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,239
more personal, words related to them 
become less taboo

141
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,888
and more common; 
whereas words that were common in the past

142
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,778
are increasingly unpleasant. Perhaps, in the future,

143
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,408
spurt not by runaway political correctness but by wider

144
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:23,809
knowledge, words like "schizo", "mental",

145
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,499
"aspy", or even "depressed" will take the square stage.

146
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,859
Or as John McWhorter ventured,
words centered around class and the gap

147
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,379
between

148
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,577
opportunity and disadvantage will become more

149
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:40,139
taboo. Salt of the Earth, trash,

150
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,699
chav, pikey, urban as a pejorative.

151
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,729
When McKay Hatch started a "No Cussing Club"

152
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,809
at his school, his campaign became the
target of so many online jokes and

153
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,208
insults for being lame or anti-free speech.

154
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,569
On his book, he literally subtitled his own name

155
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,729
"the most cyberbullied kid in the world."

156
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,729
People care about this stuff.
Is it censorship

157
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,159
to tell us what we can and cannot say or

158
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,869
is it a safety seal, ensuring certain
dysphemisms don't get worn down to a

159
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,828
quotidian

160
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:19,719
bluntness like every other word?

161
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,698
Or is that badness of bad words a

162
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,958
boundary, a moving boundary of we

163
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,019
reject - sometimes arbitrary,

164
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,899
sometimes irrational, but always moving
in the direction of acceptance

165
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,149
moving forward?

166
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,289
Crime and inequality have existed ever since

167
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,818
they could. But when N.W.A released a
reaction, in the form of a song with bad

168
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,049
word in the title,

169
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,568
"F*** the Police",
the Federal Bureau of Investigations released

170
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:57,019
a statement against the song.
It was the only time,

171
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,338
up until then and since,
the FBI has ever issued an official statement

172
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:04,389
about a work of art.

173
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,688
Bad words have power.

174
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:11,318
If you wanna push for change you'll need something

175
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,099
to push. If everything's fine,

176
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,379
nothing's cool.

177
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,799
So, bad words are the precipitate of a larger

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,299
reaction - the process of us slowly becoming

179
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,179
what we want to become.

180
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,529
That's some deep s***.

181
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,589
And as always,

182
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,750
 thanks for watching.
