00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,089
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,229
And today we've got DONG, things you can do
online now, guys.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,549
Let's begin with a recommendation from @catchfoot,
supercut.org.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,238
It's a reservoir of video collections.
For instance, every Steve Buscemi death on

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,358
camera.
Four minutes of people giving out 555 numbers

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,179
in movies, or a minute-and-a-half of vloggers
apologising for not realising videos lately.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:31,518
For a "in real life" supercut, check out Winter,
he's on a mission to visit every single Starbucks

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,939
in the world.
His site is a great destination for photos

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,499
of Starbucks, like lots of them.
MegaRandompeoplez recommended Depict1, a great

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,419
game where the narrator lies to you and you
have to disobey in order to move forward,

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,959
never knowing what to believe.
ConfusedAshleyK has even more control in Level

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,288
Editor.
You have only a short amount of time to both

13
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:59,299
build the level and complete it.
Keep built things safe in Epic Rail, where

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,749
you have to switch rail paths to send trains
in the right direction while keeping them

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,789
from colliding.
Now, as a Tower Defence lover I have to agree

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,069
with Blackmamba329, Balloon Tower Defence
is quite fun.

17
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:23,839
Saintsage777 reminded me of rainymood.com,
a relaxing site of continuous rain noise.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,069
I was always told to play it while listening
to the Widdler's Day and Night Dubstep remix

19
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,368
for the ultimate effect.
Make your own dubstep remixes with Wub Machine.

20
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,448
The site does its best to remix whatever song
you drag in.

21
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:42,118
Make the beat yourself like MatthewTS22 with
this from RonWinter, the keyboard controls

22
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,639
all the fun sounds.
Incredibox comes via Vegemitosis and it's

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,419
a brilliant a capella song you can control
the layers of.

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:59,419
Drag in new voices, new beat boxing, new back
up singers, etc., etc.

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,688
CreatureFeatureRIz showed off Seaquence, a
site where you also control the music, but

26
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,948
by building little sea creatures that make
noise based on their shapes.

27
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,668
Have them live together and make music together.
Now, I love ambigrams - figures that are one

28
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,119
thing from angle and another from a different
angle.

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,189
This website makes them for you.
For instance, my first and last name makes

30
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,069
this one.
See, at first it says Michael, but upside

31
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,818
down it says Stevens.
If you still have free time left, check out

32
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,959
TehN1ppe.
He loops simple images and sounds over and

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,848
over and over again, but through wizardry
of compression and patience he makes them

34
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:43,238
all ten hours long.
Want more?

35
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,219
Zommyo pointed me to the longest video on
YouTube.

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,119
It's compressed beyond all recognition but
clocks in at 596 hours long.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,488
Not long enough?
Check out the longest list of the longest

38
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:03,518
stuff at the longest domain name at long last.com.
The site catalogues the longest of almost

39
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,619
everything.
The longest book, longest popsicle, longest

40
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,249
spacewalk, longest distance walked backwards,
longest zucchini and on and on and on.

41
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,818
And on Twitter last week I showed off one
of the YouTube comments with the most thumb-ups

42
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,739
ever, so follow us to stay up to date.
And, if you're not already subscribed to Vsauce2,

43
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,819
you're missing out on half of Vsauce.
If you subscribe to Vsauce2, you get mind

44
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,039
blowing technology, weird people fact, more
leanbacks.

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,759
It's literally twice the sauce.
So pour some all over.

46
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,539
And as always,

47
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,860
thanks for watching.
