1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,879
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Where are your fingers?

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,089
Seriously. It's a pretty easy question.
You should be able to answer it.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,699
But how do you know?
How does

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,629
anyone know anything? You might say, well,
I know where my fingers are. I'm looking

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,329
right at them.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,268
Or, I can touch them, I can feel them, they're
right here and that's good.

7
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:26,329
Your senses are a great way to learn things.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,868
In fact, we have way more than the usual
five senses we talk about.

9
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,179
For instance, your kinesthetic sense, proprioception.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,249
This is what the police evaluate
during a field sobriety test.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,159
It allows you to tell where your fingers
and arms and head and legs in your body

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,808
is all in relation to each other

13
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,319
without having to look or touch other things.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,669
We have way more than five senses, we
have at least twice as many

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,558
and then some. But they're not perfect.
There are optical illusions,

16
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,089
audio illusions,

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,698
temperature sensation illusions, even tactile

18
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,609
illusions.
Can you turn your tongue upside down?

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,609
If so, perfect. Try this.
Run your finger

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,139
along the outer edge of the tip of your upside down

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,899
tongue. Your tongue will be able to feel 
your finger, but in the wrong place.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,319
Our brains never needed to develop an understanding

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,879
of upside down tongue touch.
So, when you touch the right side of your tongue

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,179
when it's flipped over to your left side
you perceive a sensation

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,059
on the opposite side, where your tongue 
usually is but isn't

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,618
when it's upside down.
It's pretty freaky and cool

27
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,298
and a little humbling,
because it shows the limits of the

28
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:49,209
accuracy of our senses, the only tools we
have to get what's out there

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,889
in here.
The philosophy of knowledge,

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,938
the study of knowing, is called Epistomology.

31
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,218
Plato famously said that the things we know

32
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,559
are things that are true, that we believe

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,877
and that we have justification for believing.
those justifications might be

34
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,847
irrational

35
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:13,439
or they might be rational, they might be based on proof,

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,979
but don't get too confident because
proven is not a synonym

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,969
for true. Luckily, there are things that we can know

38
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,738
without needing proof, without needing to
even leave the house, things that we can

39
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:27,929
know as true

40
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,509
by reason alone.
These are things that we know

41
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,159
a priori.
An example would be the statement

42
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,378
"all bachelors are unmarried."
I don't have to go survey

43
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,378
every bachelor on earth to know that that is true.

44
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,128
All bachelors are unmarried
because that's how we define

45
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,539
the word bachelor. 
Of course, you have to know what the words

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,539
bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place.

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,649
Oh, you do? Okay. Perfect. That's great.
But

48
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,208
how do you know?
This time I mean

49
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,768
functionally, how do you know?
Where is knowledge biologically

50
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:10,579
in the brain?
What are memories made out of?

51
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,119
We are a long way from being able to
answer that question completely

52
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,839
but research has shown that memories
don't exist in the brain in single

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,158
locations.
Instead, what we call

54
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,169
a memory is likely made up of many

55
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,839
different complex relationships all over
the brain between lots of brain cells,

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,859
neurones. A major cellular mechanism
thought to underlie the formation of

57
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,649
memories

58
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,789
is long-term potentiation or

59
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,859
LTP.
When one neurone stimulates another neurone

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,619
repeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtime

61
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,408
LTP, wiring them more strongly together

62
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,518
and that connection can last a long time, even

63
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,988
an entire lifetime.
A collection of different brain cells,

64
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,289
neurones that fire together in a particular order

65
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,488
over and over again frequently and repeatedly

66
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,749
can achieve long-term potentiation, becoming

67
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,548
more sensitive to each other and more
ready to fire in the exact same way

68
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,559
later on in the future.
They're a physical thing

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,987
in your brain, firing together more easily

70
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,429
because you strengthen that pattern of firing.

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,219
You memorized.
This branching forest of firing friends

72
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,418
looks messy, but look closer.
It could be the memory

73
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,609
of your first kiss.
A living souvenir

74
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,769
of the event.
If I were to go into your brain and cut out

75
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,319
those cells, could I make you forget your first kiss

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,429
or could I make you forget where your fingers are?

77
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,439
Only if I cut out a lot of your brain.

78
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,549
Because memories aren't just stored in one
relationship, they're stored

79
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,939
all over the brain. The events leading up
to your first kiss are stored in one

80
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,649
network,

81
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,249
the way it felt to the way it smelled in
different networks, all added up together

82
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,719
making what you call the memory of your first kiss.

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,079
How many memories can you fit

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,869
inside your head?
What is the storage capacity

85
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,668
of the human brain?
The best we can do is a rough

86
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,329
estimate, but given the number of
neurons in the brain involved with

87
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,069
memory

88
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,508
and the number of different connections
a single neurone can make

89
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,649
Paul Reber at Northwestern University estimated

90
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,929
that we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5

91
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,119
petabytes of information.
That's the equivalent of recording a TV channel

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,489
continuously for 300 years.

93
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,099
That's a lot of information.
That is a lot of information about

94
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,339
skills you can do and facts and people you've met,

95
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,429
things in the real world.

96
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,538
The world is real, right?

97
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,869
How do you know?
It's a difficult question,

98
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,439
but it's not rocket science.
Instead, it is

99
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,469
asking whether or not rocket scientists
even exist in the first place.

100
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,758
The theory that the Sun moved around the earth

101
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,339
worked great. It predicted that the Sun
would rise every morning

102
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,758
and it did. It wasn't until later that we
realized what we thought was true

103
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,279
might not be.
So, do we

104
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,709
or will we ever know true reality

105
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,309
or are we stuck in a world where the
best we can do is be

106
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:42,138
approximately true? Discovering more and
more useful theories every day but never

107
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:43,568
actually reaching

108
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:48,198
true objective actual reality.

109
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,179
Can science or reason ever prove convincingly

110
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,559
that your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,179
actually exist beyond your mind?
That you don't just live

112
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,698
in the matrix?

113
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,059
No.
Your mind is all that you have,

114
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,239
even if you use instruments, like a telescope

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,508
or particle accelerators.
The final stop

116
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,909
for all of that information is ultimately

117
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,559
you.
You are alone in your own brain,

118
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,119
which technically makes it impossible to prove that

119
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,129
anything else exists.
It's called

120
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,038
the egocentric predicament.
Everything you know

121
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,439
about the world out there depends on

122
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,609
and is created inside your brain.

123
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,749
This mattered so much to Charles Sanders Peirce
that he drew a line

124
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,989
between reality, the way the universe truly is,

125
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,329
and what he called the phaneron,
the world as filtered through our senses

126
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,689
and bodies, the only information we can get.

127
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,068
If you want to speak with certainty you live in,

128
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,369
that is you react to and remember and experience your

129
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,649
phaneron, not reality.

130
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,668
The belief that only you exist

131
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,459
and everything else, food, the universe,
your friends are all

132
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,639
figments of your mind is called
solipsism.

133
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,049
There is no way to convince

134
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,209
a solipsist that the outside world

135
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,459
is real.
And there is no way to convince someone who

136
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,059
doubts that the universe wasn't created
just three seconds ago

137
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,139
along with all of our memories.
It's a frightening realization

138
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,428
that we don't always know how to deal with.
There's even

139
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,009
The Matrix defense.
In 2002

140
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,639
Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady.

141
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,569
She argued that she believed she was in
the matrix, that her crimes

142
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,949
weren't real.
By using the matrix defense

143
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,889
she was found not guilty

144
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,509
by reason of insanity, because the
opposite view is just way more healthy

145
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,569
and common.

146
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,929
It's called realism.
Realism is the belief that the

147
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,489
outside world exists independently of your own

148
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,119
phaneron.
Rocks and stars and Thora Birch

149
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,379
would continue to exist even if you weren't around

150
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,458
to experience them.
But you cannot

151
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:22,619
know realism is true.
All you can do

152
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,398
is believe.
Martin Gardner, a great source for math magic tricks,

153
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,699
explained that he is not a solipsist
because realism is just way more

154
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,109
convenient

155
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,319
and healthy and it works.

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,659
As to whether it bothered him that he
could never know realism was true,

157
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,898
he wrote "if you ask me to tell you
anything about the nature of what lies

158
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:46,719
beyond the phaneron,

159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,179
my answer is how should I know?
I'm not dismayed by ultimate mysteries,

160
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,338
I can no more grasp what is behind such questions

161
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,449
as my cat can understand what is
behind the clatter i make

162
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,389
while I type this paragraph."
Humble stuff.

163
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,958
What strikes me

164
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,268
is the cat.
Cats do not understand keyboards,

165
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,508
but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be.

166
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,099
It's a great way to get the attention
of a human, they're warm

167
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,528
and exciting, surrounded by noises and
flashing lights plus

168
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,219
cats love to get their scent
on whatever they can,

169
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,989
a mark of their existence.

170
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,279
We aren't that much different,
except instead of keyboards

171
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,389
we have the mysteries of the universe.

172
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,599
We will never be able to understand all
of them. We won't be able to ever answer

173
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,259
every single question,

174
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,639
but walking around in those questions, exploring them,

175
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,209
is fun.
It feels good.

176
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,469
And as always,

177
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:55,649
thanks for watching.

178
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,809
Do you want more unanswered questions?
Well, you're in luck.

179
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,199
