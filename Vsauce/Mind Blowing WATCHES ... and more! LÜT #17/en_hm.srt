00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,228
Mario backpacks and SLR mount

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:10,139
for your iPhone. It's episode 17 of LÃœT.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,968
Wear your glasses
and shades together in one piece while

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:13,689
browsing

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,849
portal necklaces, Aperture totes,
laptop stickers and on and on and on.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,669
And here's a book that shows you how to
build weapons out of stuff you've got

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,709
around the office

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,309
or classroom. Now that you're officially
awesome, chew on some beef jerky

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,029
potato chips. And rather than buying
someone a card for

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,499
every occasion, buy a bunch of utility cards.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,839
Each cards' word search contains more
than 100 wishes and sentiments,

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,119
so just circle the ones that apply to
that person on that day.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,139
With all the time you save relax with a
drink in a doom glass

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,849
while wearing literary-themed t-shirts.
Moby Dick,

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,169
The Bell Jar, Tell-Tale Heart,
The Sun Also Rises and more.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,999
Now look, cats love chasing laser
pointers, but why do all that difficult

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,549
hand moving when you could have the FroliCat BOLT

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,969
do it for you?
The Museum of Modern Art carries toast coasters

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,959
and a bubble necklace. Or make a bubble
necklace for free in the shower while

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,589
storing products on the shower squid.

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,209
Then clean your hands with some hand soap.
No, no, no.

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,809
Some hand soap. Once they're clean,
shove on some pickle

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,868
finger puppets while your pet finger paints

24
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,029
masterpieces with no mess thanks to ThinkGeek,

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,269
which also offers a bacon-scented air freshener

26
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,709
and chapstick.
I mean, SPAM flavored

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,789
lip glaze. Charge your phone in an emergency
with this solar powered USB charging

28
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,359
pack that gives you 8 extra hours of power

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,749
and teach your baby something new thanks to Tiffany

30
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,419
Ard. She designs X&Y chromosome earrings,
as well as this baby room picture

31
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,978
that teaches not ABC's, not 123's,

32
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,099
but prime numbers. From 2 ladybugs

33
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,199
to 41 pieces of bacon to 53 snails.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,219
Before we run out of time, let's talk about time.

35
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,089
Telling it complexly and beautifully.
Tokyoflash designs amazing sci-fi

36
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,037
watches that you'll know how to read

37
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,659
while confusing strangers and attracting
hot alien ladies.

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,848
I leave you with some of NeatoShop's
I heart shirts.

39
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,519
And, not a free thing, but a free piece of
historical information -

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,969
what I like to call epic gifts in history.

41
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,049
In 1865, Seth Kinman

42
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,238
gave President Andrew Johnson a chair.

43
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,089
A chair made out of a bear.
Who exactly was Seth Kinman?

44
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,249
Well, he was a hunter who owned a bar and
once played fiddle for Abraham Lincoln.

45
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,579
You know, a fiddle that he made out of a mule

46
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,439
skull.
They're not yet available to buy online,

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,239
but in the meantime...

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,479
As always,

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:05,318
thanks for watching.
