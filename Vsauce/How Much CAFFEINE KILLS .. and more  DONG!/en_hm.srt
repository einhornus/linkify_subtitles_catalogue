1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,439
Vsauce. Are you still paying money for
things you have to wait to do in real

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:04,829
life?

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,229
Well, no worries, because I've got more free
stuff you can do online now, guys.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,919
DONG. Lots of great suggestions from
WeSaucers today. First

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,629
from 'fippoolive', Google search.
Why be all floaty

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,198
when can use Google gravity? As soon as your mouse touches it, it collapses, but

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,239
remains usable. Is it too slow for you?
Well, try to kill yourself with caffeine.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,598
This site suggested by 'illustr8r777'
lets you pick your favorite drink,

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,799
enter your weight and find out how many
energy drinks you'd have to drink

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,569
to die.
Before you do, use the energy to multitask.

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,929
This game comes from 'matti1310199'

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,189
and 'OVER9000ACCOUNTS'. As you play, more and more things come up that you have

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:46,859
to do.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,249
Here I am using the left and right arrows to balance a ball,

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,909
up and down to avoid triangles and shift to jump.

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,799
Too much stress, too many buttons to push? Well, 'hall0fgamez'

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,929
asks us why not just hit your head
against a wall?

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,359
Press left then right over and over
again. The more times you hit your head,

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,359
the more freaked out and trippy the game becomes. Too simple?

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,839
Well, 'Sicvicious' thinks big - World's Biggest

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,429
Pac-Man. On this site you can choose
which board to play.

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,008
Everything's normal, except when you escape out the side you shift

23
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,959
to the next board. Once that game makes
you sick of Pac-Man, do the

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,499
opposite like 'ARealCoolUsername' - Anti Pac-Man.

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,219
Here, you play as a ghost and try to get Pac-Man. Of course,

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,188
when he turns you blue you've gotta run.
Now, I've been a fan of this site for a long

27
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,249
time. Girl Talk

28
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,179
makes great mashups and this site
visually lays out in real time

29
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:50,479
where every sample is coming from.
Take a look.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,109
Well, make your own music on this site,
suggested by lots of WeSaucers.

31
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,809
Click a box and it will rhythmically generate a tone. Draw whatever you want.

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,419
For instance, this is the sound of Vsauce.

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,868
Or get symphonic with 'Killerzac's'
recommendation. You have to manipulate

34
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:08,749
arrows to direct

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,949
energy into boxes to hear new instruments.

36
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,079
Or be darker with Webby nominee 'Ana Somnia'.

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,169
This site uses your web cam to detect
brightness and you actually have to turn

38
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,149
out the lights or find a dark place

39
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,969
in order for her to dream. Now every
dream she has is unique

40
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,429
and completely crazy, but as soon as you
turn the lights back on or even

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,458
check your phone, she'll know and wake up

42
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,829
and end the dream.
Even more crazy is psycho paint.

43
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,789
This site is also up for a Webby and
it let's you mimick the brushstrokes of great

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,479
painters

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,689
on your own pictures. Here's Lauren and I.
Let me just jazz it up a little over here

46
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,329
and there.

47
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,749
Beautiful.
I leave you with something new.

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,089
Vsauce Leanback. It's a playlist I hope to make

49
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,598
every week that contains videos from other
creators that I think are really cool.

50
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,229
The playlist lasts as long as an actual
television episode, so it's like

51
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,609
Vsauce, but grown-up. So if you ever wanna lean back and relax and let the videos

52
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,579
change themselves and have Vsauce be your tour guide,

53
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,589
check it out. There's a link in the description
and let me know what you think, because

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,759
I'm very interested to know.

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,079
And hey, as always,

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,500
thanks for watching.
