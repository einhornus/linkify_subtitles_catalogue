1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,379
Do you consider yourself a fan of dogs?
Or cloud ice cream?

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,779
Well, it's episode 47 of IMG!

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,689
This is a mirror and this is clear glass.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,529
A broccoli tree house and, with the right
outline, Europe can be a dragon.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,799
In the early 1900s, Arthur S. Mole and John
D. Thomas took photos of thousands of American

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,268
soldiers standing in shapes from atop a tower.
Here they are as the Statue of Liberty.

7
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:34,829
In the front, there are 17 men.
The men in the torch are a half mile away and

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:41,509
of the 18,000 men arranged into this shape,
12,000 of them are in the torch.

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,119
The photographers also got people to stand
in the shape of Uncle Sam, President Woodrow

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,909
Wilson and a panther.
Subaru backwards is Ur A Bus and this piece

11
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,849
of furniture is actually a cake.
But this storm trooper?

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,619
Well, he's also a cake.
If you were a lot of rings, you can make your

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,098
fist Pac-Man.
And a stereographic projection projects a

14
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,828
sphere onto a flat plane.
A complete 360 degree view gets wrapped up

15
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:16,728
in a circle.
Josh Summers makes some of my favorites.

16
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:21,849
It's as if everything you can see from where
you're standing becomes its own planet.

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,749
Bongiovanni's paintings of birds look like
reality is melting.

18
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,758
But Takeshi Kawano's melting animal sculptures
are even more liquid-y.

19
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,349
Lots of things will melt when our Sun dies.
At first, it will expand and become a red

20
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,648
giant, eventually swallowing the Earth.
As water boils away, we will be left with

21
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,228
this - what Earth would look like without water.

22
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,288
And this is what Mars would look like with water.

23
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:53,308
But Niagara Falls without water?
Well, it's happened.

24
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:58,699
In 1969, the army core of engineers dammed
the river to strengthen some faults and slow

25
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,778
its erosion.
Lay on the ground and take a photo straight

26
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:07,679
down to put yourself in cool positions.
And here's a map of a global subway system.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,649
Buzzfeed collected 9 pictures of cats wrapped
up like burritos, but for the montage let's

28
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,109
take a look at forever alone?
Nailed it.

29
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:33,419
Nails bent into different situations by Andrei Nikolaev.

30
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,349
When you're this happy, your eyes are actually
drooling smiley faces.

31
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,679
Oh, and this cat's mouth is an angry bunny.
Wow, well, at least dogs haven't enslaved

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,149
kids yet.
Oh.

33
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,059
Bruce Lowell sources LEGO parts and creates
fantastic items.

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:57,809
A taco, a sandwich or a LEGO paint effect.
This painting is also an effect.

35
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,609
The woman is a real person.
Alexa Meade uses acrylic paint on people's

36
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,859
bodies to make them look like paintings of
themselves.

37
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,039
These people aren't painted, but they don't
know each other.

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,779
I've always loved this project.
Artist Richard Renaldi walks around and finds

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,589
total strangers out in public.
He then asks them, despite the fact that they

40
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,739
don't know each other, to pose for photos
as if they were close friends or lovers.

41
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,859
Strangers also touch when cartoon characters
are placed in famous paintings.

42
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,289
And here are some hipster Disney princesses.
Or, the princesses as super heroes.

43
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,449
Oh, remember those living photographs of soldiers?
Another type of living photograph is this.

44
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,319
Many YouTube videos are quick paced and jump
cut every 4 seconds, but living photographs

45
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,759
do the opposite.
The subject poses for minutes, like when you're

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,499
taking a picture of someone but forget you're
in video mode.

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,039
Watching is kind of amazingly awkward.
And the cloth wrapped around these trees lines up

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,669
with the mountains in the distance, which,
my friends, is artwork.

49
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,829
And as always,

50
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,630
thanks for watching.
