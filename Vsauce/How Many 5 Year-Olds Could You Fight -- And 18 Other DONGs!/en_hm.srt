Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And I am now living
in London. Besides popping on over to Disneyland

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:18,199
Paris, I've also been looking at DONGs: Things
you can Do Online Now, Guys. For instance,

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,429
because I'm now in Britain, my team has changed
for clickclickclick.com. The site recognizes

4
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,749
what country you're in and then asks you
to click as many times as you can. Earn turbo-clicks

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,869
to get two minutes of auto-clicking and when
you're done, submit to support your country.

6
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,749
These were the standings when I played.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,539
This website takes a look at your physical
and moral strength and then calculates approximately

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,349
how many 5-year-olds you could take in a fight.

9
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,189
Gorillablackdog recommended Drinkify. Tell
it a musician and it will give you some tunes

10
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,219
and a drink recommendation. Now, we all love
soundboards, but when it comes to a button

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,919
that makes noises - 10, 100, 1,000 - it's never
enough. Luckily, MyInstants contains literally

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,879
more than 3,000 sound clips available with a click.

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,949
IFlores105 showed my MyWorldMapper, which
is amazing, it's full of maps of the world

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,969
where regions are physically bloated or shriveled,
based on statistics. This one, for instance,

15
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,459
allows you to visually compare how many people
live in cities on Earth.

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,089
Themediversion's Image Mosaic Generator is
nice. Upload any image you want and it will

17
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,459
spit you back thousands of images which, from
afar, are your original.

18
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,059
Whoops, are you trying to break the law?
Well, don't do anything until you check out the

19
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,379
Ransom Note Generator. This way, your messages
will be anonymous and needlessly frightening.

20
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,638
If you're like PumpkinHead5150 and you want
to waste time playing free games but also

21
00:01:52,639 --> 00:02:00,028
read some great literature, play Silent Conversation.
Here, you are the "I" floating above text.

22
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:03,828
Touch every word while maneuvering around
dangerous words.

23
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:08,748
Aether is an art game where you travel by
using your tongue like a grappling hook. As

24
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:14,759
you ascend away from a planet, gravity changes,
and you swing through space, fall to other

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,128
worlds, and figure out their puzzles. 
Once you do, the planet regains its color.

26
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,539
In Prior, you're a square who has forgotten
everything - who you are, who your family is.

27
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,378
All you can hope to do is read scraps of paper
about you to learn your story and how to

28
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,078
even play the game.

29
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:38,899
Concerned Joe is like being the bus from Speed.
If you don't move, your health falls and

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:47,999
the narrator, well, he's ridiculous. Concerned
Joe was submitted by SporkMurderer. Now, she

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,839
might murder sporks, but the internet loves
them, according to WhatDoesTheInternetThink.net.

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,578
The site searches a word or phrase you enter
and evaluates the positivity, or negativity,

33
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,848
of what's being said about it on the web.
And look, sporks tend to be discussed with

34
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,458
quite a bit of mirth.

35
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:12,099
Super Pig. Angelperson0 submitted this.
A game of dark rooms where bacon won't help,

36
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,408
but stumbling onto spikes means that your
blood fluorescently splatters, giving the

37
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,519
next pig an idea of what's ahead. You've only
got so many pigs, so be careful.

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,859
Now, if you'd rather splatter something more
humane, be like PryoStar and use JacksonPollock.org.

39
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:36,199
Every time you click, the color changes. Not
cute enough? Well, Purrgirl234 says Cornify.

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,718
Drag this little thing right hear to your
bookmarks bar and BAM. Now, whenever you're

41
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,879
on a site, you can click it to add unicorns.

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,718
And here's a game that's like an almost never-ending
brick breaker, except the colored pieces you

43
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,188
break off become balls you can keep using.

44
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:59,229
Now, ChocolateMilkMonster served us up a Puzzler.
You want all the balls to be the same color

45
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,969
and when you click one it turns a quarter-turn
clockwise, and if its blue lines meet any

46
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,629
of those of balls around it, that ball will
become the same color and also turn a quarter-turn.

47
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:15,369
Set off small chain reactions and play the
end carefully. VoilÃ¡. But in case of emergency,

48
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:23,519
call the EmergencyYodel.com.

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,099
Finally, Reddit user iamcogita created this
YouTube educational mural, it's incredible.

50
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,779
So many of my friends! You can click their
heads to see their channels, or, go straight

51
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,449
to youtube.com/edu to find others like us,
especially the ones who don't appear on camera,

52
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,499
who probably made themselves harder to draw.

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,519
Stay saucy.

54
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,539
And as always,

55
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,860
thanks for watching.
