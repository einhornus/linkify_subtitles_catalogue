1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,898
The best way to play horseshoes and
Rihanna's butt sings a song.

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,799
It's episode 36 of IMG!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,489
Mankind has come a long way

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,928
but this concept for an alarm clock that
slowly shreds money

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,729
until you wake up and stop it is genius.
Less genius

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,068
is this guy.
Kid, kid,

7
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:24,598
shark kid.
And here's a cat with cat-shaped

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,658
fur.
Enjoy your summer with a Death Star melon

9
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:31,258
and once cold weather arrives, wear some
mittens that have a second pair of

10
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,018
mittens build into them,
so you can hold your child's hand

11
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:37,339
and give them gloves.
Is this the front or

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,198
the side of a man?
And this blurry face is both

13
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:44,588
one face and two faces kissing.
Can you see both?

14
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:48,518
But now a famous psychology experiment.
Which of these shapes is called

15
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:51,678
'bouba' and which is called 'kiki?'
It turns out

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,009
that because our brains so naturally assign
abstract concepts to sounds,

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,709
around the world, no matter what language
or culture people come from,

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,158
nearly 98 percent call this one 'kiki,'

19
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,309
and that one 'bouba.'
However this is not how to use

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,379
doorknob.
So let's do triplets. Mariachi band,

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,219
fried chicken, bathtub.
Man, monkey,

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,139
parrot.
And now let's enjoy classic cartoon heroes

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:32,499
as pin-up girls.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,809
This cat can be made out of this cat
by doing this.

25
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,969
And this goose is wearing sandals.
People don't always listen to

26
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,249
rules and they can't always see the
hidden dog.

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,909
Once you find him, make a cooper and jump.
Reddit brought us Bruce Willis

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,039
loving Bruce Willis.
But here's a kid who is forever

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,349
alone.
Here's a photographer... oh.

30
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,439
The only thing worse is sending mail to
this address.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,719
Clippy is just as annoying in real life,
but tattoing your Facebook friends

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,978
onto your real life arm

33
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:06,939
is awesome. On facebook.com/VsauceGaming
David showed us a

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,549
panda

35
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,249
dog, and Nicolas suggested a twisted
E = mc 2

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,609
that's more emo. A different guy named David
displayed some LEGO creations he's selling

37
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,609
on eBay.

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,759
This toilet is creative,
but these are even scarier.

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,829
Today's episode of IMG! was very
special because right now

40
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,949
I am in London.
In fact, check this out. That

41
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,579
bathtub, that is now a table,
used to belong and was used

42
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,708
by Douglas Adams.
A couple days ago I was in Dublin

43
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,319
and terminal 2 at the Dublin Airport is
very important.

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,899
Let me show you what it looks like when
you drive in. Now, if you think of it in a

45
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,099
certain way it can kind of remind you

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,539
of being born, except in reverse.

47
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,529
Think about that for a second.

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,829
And as always,

49
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,930
thanks for watching.
