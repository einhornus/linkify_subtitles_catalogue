being so happy to be up there

529
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:27,758
and the wind
blowing my hair back,

530
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,560
and my dad kept
telling me to sit down,

531
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,563
and I wouldn't sit down.
- Yeah, you weren't scared.

532
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:36,066
- [laughs]
- How high up were you?

533
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:40,003
- Probably, like...

534
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:41,538
800 feet.

535
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:42,873
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

536
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,941
- Wow.

537
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:48,512
 Victoria's false memory
 is beginning to take hold

538
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,948
 with the help of her
imaginative subconscious brain.

539
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:55,385
What do you remember seeing
from up in the hot air balloon?

540
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:57,087
- The water fountain,
for sure...

541
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,523
- Yeah?
- And I could have been crazy,

542
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,491
but I think
that I could have felt,

543
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:04,428
like, almost a little bit
of mist hit my skin

544
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,063
from the water fountain.

545
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,665
- What color was the balloon?

546
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,500
- I wanna say it was red.

547
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,402
- Red.
- Yeah.

548
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:14,438
 Let's see if
 the seed I planted earlier

549
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,006
 has taken hold.

550
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,542
You took a ride
in a hot air balloon

551
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,644
and you dropped something.

552
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:22,546
- I don't remember that.

553
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,082
- You dropped something.
- I did.

554
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,617
At that age,
I was a huge Barney fan...

555
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,387
- Ah.
- And I just, like, remember

556
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:33,357
just, like--and looking down
and him just being gone.

557
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,759
- [laughs] About where
did it fall do you think?

558
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,762
- Um...I would say

559
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,498
six or seven blocks away.

560
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,666
- Oh, really?

561
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,134
So not in the water?
- No.

562
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,670
 - By now,
 it seems Victoria's brain

563
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,772
has turned our suggested memory

564
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,808
 into a complete
 childhood experience.

565
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,677
- I remember

566
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,645
waking up at, like,

567
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:58,081
9:00 in the morning,

568
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,883
getting in the car,

569
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:02,119
and then my mom and I
being in the car

570
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,820
having no idea
where we were going

571
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,422
'cause he loved to do that.

572
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:06,823
Just put the family in the car

573
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:09,059
and just go somewhere,
and just, like, surprise us.

574
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,662
 - Victoria is personalizing
 this false memory

575
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:14,898
 by merging it
 with pleasant details

576
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,767
 from her childhood.

577
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,503
- And next thing you know, like,
we're just, like, flying over,

578
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,472
like, the whole,
like, greater Los Angeles area.

579
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:26,109
- So who do you think was
in the basket with you?

580
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,078
- Well, definitely
both my parents.

581
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,880
I know we got something
to eat afterwards.

582
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,516
Almost I wanna say, like,
a churro or something like that.

583
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,484
- Post-balloon churro.
- Yeah.

584
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,520
[laughs] Yeah.
- It's a classic.

585
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,789
 - Now that
 our subjects are convinced

586
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,557
 that the balloon ride
 happened...

587
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,492
- [laughs]
- Oh, shit.

588
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,761
 - It's time
 for a reality check.

589
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,763
Tell your mom, uh, the memory.

590
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:48,832
- We went, like,
on a hot air balloon ride,

591
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,502
and I dropped,
I think, my Superman cape.

592
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:57,941
Why you looking like that?
- [laughing]

593
00:22:57,942 --> 00:23:01,478
No, Dylan.
That never happened.

594
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,146
That never happened.

595
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:05,549
- Wait, what?
- There was never

596
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,651
a balloon ride.

597
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,919
- We made the whole story up.

598
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,922
Well, you made most of it up.

599
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,624
- Oh, wow.
- But isn't that amazing?

600
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,828
 Because, remember,
 we planted that story.

601
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,629
- No, that is.
That's actually really crazy.

602
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,565
I-I was actually having these--

603
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,033
these, like,
weird, faint memories

604
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,502
of me, like, looking over,
like the pond,

605
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,070
and, like, you know--
I don't even know.

606
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,707
- Has Dylan been
to Echo Park before?

607
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,743
- Oh, wow.
 - And now it's Victoria's turn

608
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:36,012
 for a rude awakening
 from her father.

609
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:38,648
- Hi.
- The story is not true.

610
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,083
- What?

611
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:41,585
- You've never been
in a hot air balloon.

612
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,220
- What're you guys
talking about?

613
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,755
Why would you make that up?
- Did you truly believe

614
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:46,857
that you'd been
in a hot air balloon?

615
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,024
- Yes.

616
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,259
- You remembered
so many details...

617
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,861
- Yes.
- Of something

618
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,096
that never happened.
- Yes.

619
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,131
- How many times you been
in a hot air balloon?

620
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:56,900
- None.

621
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,802
- So what were you remembering?

622
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,871
- I'm not entirely sure

623
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,508
because I really do
feel like I have a memory.

624
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,943
- We all are susceptible
to this.

625
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:11,515
- I really felt like I had
experienced that experience.

626
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,917
 - And what about our YouTuber,
 Tim?

627
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,253
- Well, Tim, I'll tell you what.
It's not surprising

628
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,821
that you don't remember
anything from it.

629
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,723
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause it never happened.

630
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,725
