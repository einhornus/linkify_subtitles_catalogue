 [soft dramatic music]

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,243
- Hi, I'm Michael Stevens,

3
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,212
but who are you?

4
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:16,414
Do you even know who you are?

5
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,249
 Are you your memories?

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,651
- I don't remember that.

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,319
- I don't remember that at all.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,254
- Are you the choices you make?

9
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:25,256
The focus tester

10
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:27,392
is actually a magician.

11
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:28,660
- That's scary.
[chuckles]

12
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,695
 - Or are you your past?

13
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:34,265
- I hit the back of my head
and I forgot my entire life.

14
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,401
Just like you hit
a delete button on a computer.

15
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:37,802
- [quietly]
Wow.

16
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:40,805
 [electronic music]

17
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:50,582
 â™ª â™ª

18
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,784
Have you ever looked
at a photograph of yourself

19
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:55,487
and thought,
"That's what I look like?

20
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,688
Ugh."

21
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,723
We often think we look bad

22
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:01,126
or not right in photos

23
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,529
because photos show us
what we really look like

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,264
to other people.

25
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,766
The you that
you're used to seeing

26
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:11,302
is mirror you.

27
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:14,806
Every mirror you look into
reverses your face.

28
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:17,208
Most selfie cameras do this too,

29
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:20,645
so we tend to prefer
that version of ourselves.

30
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:22,680
If you wanna see yourself
in a mirror

31
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,816
the way other people see you
in real life,

32
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:26,351
take two mirrors

33
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,853
and position them
at a 90-degree angle.

34
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:32,223
What you see won't be
yourself reversed,

35
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:34,459
but how you look in real life.

36
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,661
 So who would you say
 you are really?

37
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:38,730
 Is it how you look?

38
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,831
 Or is it how you dress?

39
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:42,734
 Or are you the atoms
 that make you up?

40
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,937
Because all of those things
change throughout your life.

41
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,739
Ah, maybe
the real common thread,

42
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,541
that which doesn't change,

43
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,242
is your history,

44
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:52,677
your memory.

45
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:55,313
 But what if we remember things
 differently

46
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:57,882
from the way
they actually happened.

47
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:04,822
Does that mean
we don't know ourselves?

48
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:06,524
False memories are

49
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:09,761
frighteningly easy to create.

50
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,429
Today, we're gonna make some,

51
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,231
and we're gonna have
a little fun doing it.

52
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:15,700
We have created a fake game show

53
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,602
called "Who You Were."

54
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:19,771
We're gonna bring contestants
down memory lane

55
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,940
and have them tell us
about their past.

56
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,909
 Some of which we're going
 to completely make up.

57
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,879
We're gonna plant a few
little seeds in this mind field

58
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,414
and see if we can grow

59
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:33,318
some fake memories.

60
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,987
 [cheers and applause]

61
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:37,655
Hi, I'm Michael Stevens,

62
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:38,957
and welcome to the show

63
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,693
that takes you on a trip
down memory lane

64
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,394
from who you are

65
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:44,996
all the way back through...

66
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,565
"Who You Were."

67
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,968
Please welcome
today's very special guest,

68
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,237
Timothy DeLaGhetto.
- How's it going, man.

69
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,571
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thanks for having me.

70
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:56,374
- Excited to kinda
dive into some memories?

71
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,842
- Yeah, I don't really know
what to expect.

72
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,310
- To begin, though,
let's give the audience

73
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:00,945
a taste of your life.

74
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,314
- Oh, my God, let's take a look.

75
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:05,450
- So Tim was raised
in California

76
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,985
where he and his parents
owned and operated

77
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,419
a Thai food restaurant.
- [laughing]

78
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,588
- Tim found popularity
as a rapper,

79
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,757
comedian, actor,
and Internet personality,

80
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:16,861
and has attracted
over 3 million subscribers.

81
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:20,632
In order to--to kind of see
how you became who you are today

82
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,635
let's go back to who you were.
- Let's do it.

83
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,370
- We spoke to your parents...
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,738
- And they told us
some of their favorite memories

85
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,039
from when you were very,
very young.

86
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,008
- Okay.
 - I'm going to start

87
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,576
 with some true stories

88
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,712
 before I slip in
 the false memory.

89
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,347
When you were seven,

90
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:37,982
you were pretty much
held prisoner

91
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:40,652
by a very controlling
school girl.

92
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,553
The girl took control
of your life

93
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,422
and always wanted to know
what you were doing.

94
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:45,790
- I remember her.
Like, she was,

95
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,725
like, my--my best friend,
sort of,

96
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,827
but then she was also very,
like, possessive of me.

97
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,362
- But you guys aren't
together still.

98
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,730
- No, we might be
Facebook friends.

99
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,532
- Okay.
Here's a memory.

100
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,068
You weren't a crybaby
on the first day of school...

101
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,870
- Yeah.
- Until you noticed that

102
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,606
all the other kids were crying
and then you joined in.

103
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,907
- You know,
I empathize with people...

104
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,575
- Right.
- And, uh, I was just kind of,

105
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:07,345
like, helping them feel like
we were all a team.

106
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,080
 - Now here's the fake story

107
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,416
 we made up out of thin air.

108
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,884
Here's another memory.
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,552
- When you were about
four or five years old...

110
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,354
- Mm-kay.
- You actually took a ride

111
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:19,090
in a hot air balloon,
but you dropped something

112
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:22,327
from the balloon.

113
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,828
- I don't remember that at all.
[laughs]

114
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,697
- Really?
- Yeah, like, at all.

115
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,031
- We're going deep--far back.
- I didn't even know

116
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:28,733
I've ever been in
a hot air balloon

117
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,601
until you just reminded me.
- It was in Echo Park.

118
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:32,003
- Was it?
- Yeah.

119
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,271
- No clue.

120
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,474
 - Timothy is not accepting
 the story as truth yet.

121
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,076
 Time for our second subject.

122
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,077
 [xylophone trills]
 [upbeat music]

123
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,812
- Dylan, how are you?
- I'm doing great, man.

124
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,413
- You were, uh, inseparable

125
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:44,882
from you Superman cape
when you were young.

126
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:47,552
Once, you even tried
to use your super powers

127
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,687
to stop a car
driving down the street.

128
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:51,689
- Yeah, try to stop a car,
like, with my--with my hand

129
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,890
and everything.
- Did you succeed?

130
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:53,958
- You know,
the dude hit his brakes.

131
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,593
- Okay, next memory.

132
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,628
So when you were about
four or five years old,

133
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,731
you took a ride
in a hot air balloon

134
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,100
and you dropped something.

135
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,568
- Huh.

136
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,436
Uh...

137
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,638
I'm not sure
if I remember that to be honest.

138
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,774
 - Sometimes enriching
 the false story

139
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,477
 with a realistic detail
 can trigger the brain

140
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,980
to begin filling in the memory.
 Here goes.

141
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,949
Did you have a favorite toy
or anything

142
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,118
that maybe you had brought?

143
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,653
- Oh, I mean, I had, like,
some action figures, I think.

144
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,856
Um, I do remember,
like, losing one.

145
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,558
I'm not sure, like--that was,
like, the--what happened.

146
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,728
If I, uh, was
in a hot air balloon.

147
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,397
That's a crazy adventure

148
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,399
if I actually,
like, did something like that.

149
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,733
- Hi, Victoria.

150
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,902
When you were around
four or five years old,

151
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,505
you took a ride
in a hot air balloon

152
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,707
and you dropped something.

153
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,777
- I don't remember that.
- Four or five years old?

154
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,779
Up in the air?
- No.

155
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,847
- How many times you been
in a hot air balloon?

156
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:51,883
- None.

157
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,551
 - Of course
 none of the subjects

158
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:54,986
 remember the balloon ride.

159
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,821
 It never happened,

160
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:58,956
 but we are not done
 with them yet.

161
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,625
 24 hours from now,

162
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,660
 we'll take our subjects
 to Echo Park...

163
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,462
- Okay.

164
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:07,098
 - The site of their supposed
 childhood balloon ride,

165
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,600
 to see if any of
 the seeds I planted today

166
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,102
 have taken root.

167
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:14,172
This is where you took
your first hot air balloon ride.

168
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:18,810
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

169
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,113
 [soft dramatic music]

170
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,681
We might not be able

171
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:26,884
to remember our past accurately
all the time,

172
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,086
but at least we have
direct insight

173
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:31,222
into our own mental states.

174
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,957
We know how we feel,

175
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,125
what we like,

176
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:35,493
and why.

177
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:36,894
Except we don't.

178
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:40,498
Psychologists call
our tendency to overvalue

179
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,967
how we explain our own behavior

180
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:45,036
while distrusting
that other people

181
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:49,807
truly understand their own...

182
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,477
An interesting manifestation
of this bias

183
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,646
is something called...

184
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,582
It is surprisingly easy

185
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,851
to fool someone into believing

186
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,487
they made a choice
that they never did,

187
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,055
and the amazing thing is that

188
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:07,158
they'll also defend
that fake choice

189
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,027
as if it were
what they had always wanted.

190
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,662
[film reel humming]

191
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:13,831
 We feel like
 we know ourselves pretty well.

192
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:16,000
 We know why
 we like the things we like.

193
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:19,637
 We know why we decided
 to do the things that we did.

194
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:20,938
 But do we?

195
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,542
 [dramatic music]

196
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:28,579
 Today, we'll be showing
 our subjects sets of photos

197
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,715
 and asking them
 to choose the photo

198
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,117
 of the person
 they'd prefer to work with.

199
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,887
 But this isn't exactly
 what it looks like.

200
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,788
The focus tester

201
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,590
is actually a magician

202
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,158
 who will be using
 slight of hand

203
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,961
 to swap
 some of the faces they choose

204
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,864
 for faces they've rejected.

205
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:49,100
Will they catch the trick?

206
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,770
 Or will they justify
 and explain a decision

207
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,739
they never actually made?

208
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,041
- Thank you for participating
in this study

209
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,010
of first impressions
in the workplace.

210
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,812
You will be shown sets of faces
and be asked to select

211
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,015
which person you would prefer
to work with.

212
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,616
Are you ready to begin?
- I am, yes.

213
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,084
- Cool.
So would you rather

214
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:10,054
work with person "A"
or person B?

215
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:12,757
- Person B.
- Person B.

216
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,258
 [soft dramatic music]

217
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,127
That's as complex as it gets.
- [laughs]

218
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,195
I can do this.
- Person "A" or Person B?

219
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:20,064
- Uh, B.

220
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,265
B.

221
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,000
"A."

222
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,168
B.

223
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,903
"A."
- Perfect.

224
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:28,606
So we've made a pile of
your ideal workplace colleagues.

225
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,774
Effectively.
- Okay.

226
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,310
- Uh, now part two is to--

227
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,079
if you could fill out the
"women in the workplace"

228
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,348
segment of the questionnaire.

229
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,683
- All of this business
about filling out a survey,

230
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:42,186
it's just to distract them
from what's about to happen

231
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,189
 because our magician
 is gonna make a swap.

232
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,224
 There it is.

233
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,794
 Two of the eight photos
 have been swapped out

234
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,163
 for pictures
 our subject rejected.

235
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,065
 What will she say
 when presented

236
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,068
 with photos of people
 she didn't actually choose?

237
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,070
- Now, on their own merits,
I wanna ask you

238
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,972
what it was about them
that made you pick them.

239
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,907
- Okay.
 - We'll start with a picture

240
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:06,077
 that she did pick
 before we slip in the rejects.

241
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,312
- So why did you want
to work with this person?

242
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:10,014
- She looks nice.
She looks really nice,

243
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,716
but I think the person
I compared her to

244
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,250
didn't look very friendly.
- Gotcha.

245
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,952
- Here's another pair of photos

246
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:17,021
 where she had
 a clear preference.

247
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:19,657
- Person B.
- Person B.

248
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:20,958
 - Now we're going to show her

249
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,127
 the picture
 she actually rejected.

250
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:25,896
- Why did you want
to work with this person.

251
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,798
- Um, she just looked nicer
than the other one.

252
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,966
[laughs]
- Yeah.

253
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,201
- That was one
where the other girl

254
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,369
didn't look very nice at all.

255
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,204
 - Is she just misremembering

256
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,006
 this one choice?

257
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,274
 How about another photo
 she rejected?

258
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,210
- Why did you prefer
to work with this person?

259
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,344
- She looks super sweet.

260
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,846
- So that was
what you were thinking

261
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,147
when you chose that--chose her?
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:44,682
I feel like she would be
one of those girls

263
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:46,017
that would, like,
on the birthdays

264
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,385
get you the card and...
[laughs]

265
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,086
She just looks really sweet.

266
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,022
 - This isn't just
 simple misremembering.

267
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,424
This is fabricating

268
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,292
a past that never happened.

269
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,927
 Will any of our other subjects

270
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,096
 justify choices
 that they never made?

271
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:01,399
- Person "A" or Person B?

272
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,267
- "A."

273
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:06,037
 - Now we'll present him
 with the photo he rejected.

274
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,673
- So why did you choose
to work with this person?

275
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,808
- She gave off the appearance

276
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:13,144
of a genuine person

277
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,679
who would be easy to work with.

278
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,349
- People are
completely fabricating

279
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,218
justifications
for things they never even did.

280
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:23,854
I think we could actually
up the ante.

281
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:26,857
We've been swapping
two of the eight faces,

282
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:28,993
 now we'll swap four.

283
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:30,861
 Let's see if she justifies

284
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:33,397
 the photos
 that she actually rejected.

285
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,966
- I liked her--her look.

286
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,935
I like to work
with confidant people,

287
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:40,137
so, to me, she looked like
a confident person.

288
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:42,006
As a woman,
I wanna, like,

289
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,942
help other women
grow and succeed

290
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:46,077
and give them advice

291
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,978
and I gravitated
towards that picture

292
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,413
because of that reason.

293
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:52,283
She looked like a type of person
you could confide in

294
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,886
and ask advice and learn
from her experiences.

295
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,789
So I think she had
that type of look.

296
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,259
She looks like she might be,
like, a wise type of person.

297
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,794
She looks confident.

298
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,362
So I think that's
why I picked her.

299
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,898
 - She seems so sure
 of her decisions,

300
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,867
 but let's give her
 one last look.

301
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,203
- In particular,
I'm curious about how you feel

302
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,838
about these four.

303
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,372
- You know,
there's the confidence

304
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:18,242
and, um, kindness,
and somebody young.

305
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,344
I feel like that would be

306
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,813
people I could work with, so...

307
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,248
I-I stand by my decisions.
- Cool.

308
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:25,950
- Yes...[laughs]
- Perfect.

309
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,251
- Yes.
- The interesting thing

310
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:28,953
about this study...
- Okay.

311
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,522
- Is they are not actually
the ones you chose.

312
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,891
- No?

313
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,259
- These ones were.
- Oh.

314
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,861
- They were switched
while you were filling in

315
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,029
the questionnaire.
It's this phenomenon,

316
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,498
what's known as
choice blindness.

317
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,966
If we think we made a choice,

318
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,501
we will find a way
to justify that choice...

319
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,869
- Ah.
- Even if we don't know

320
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,170
that's what we made.
- Okay.

321
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,905
I was trying to justify
these four...

322
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,540
[laughs]
'Cause I forgot

323
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,408
that I picked those four.
- It's like a debate.

324
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,344
Like, no matter what--
what side I was on,

325
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,045
I was gonna give reasons
for that.

326
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:56,814
I'm, uh, I'm not happy
that I did that,

327
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:59,183
but, um, that's the reason why.

328
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,218
- You pulled this
complete switcheroo on me,

329
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,020
and I wasn't even,
like, conscious about it.

330
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:06,023
That's scary.

331
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:10,528
 â™ª â™ª

332
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,165
 - You may think you know
 why you do the things you do,

333
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,535
but, in a pinch,
your mind can replace the truth,

334
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,472
that actual past
with completely new explanations

335
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,307
that you will
confidently believe

336
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:25,543
to be exactly what happened.

337
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,579
But what if fabricating the past

338
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,815
is all you can do?

339
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,952
That may be the case
for someone with...

340
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:37,321
When you can't
remember your life at all,

341
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:40,825
what happens
to your sense of self?

342
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,828
 [dramatic music]

343
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,296
 â™ª â™ª

344
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,398
So, Scott, you have

345
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,367
retrograde amnesia.
- Correct.

346
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:53,237
- Tell me what that is,
how it happened.

347
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:56,841
- I walked into a restroom
at my office building,

348
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,877
but I slipped on
an oily substance,

349
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:01,445
and hit the back of my head

350
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,414
and suffered, you know--

351
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,051
it was, like, four-
or five-inch laceration,

352
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,087
and that gave me
retrograde amnesia,

353
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:12,857
which means everything
autobiographical

354
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,259
and historical in my life

355
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,962
were completely erased.
- Erased?

356
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,431
- Just like you hit
a delete button on a computer.

357
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,433
I've forgotten my entire life.

358
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,635
I had no idea who my wife was.

359
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,438
Her name...
my children.

360
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,341
It was absolutely horrifying.

361
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,508
- Wow.

362
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,110
So this happened
eight years ago?

363
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:35,379
- Mm-hmm.
- What memories did you have?

364
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,883
You still knew English.

365
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,252
You still knew things
like how to ride a bike.

366
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,653
That's a totally different
kind of memory.

367
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,188
both: Right.

368
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,356
- Well, when I handed him
a toothbrush,

369
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,557
he didn't comb his hair with it.

370
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:48,125
He put it in his mouth,

371
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,627
but he didn't know
what it was called.

372
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,028
- And you didn't remember

373
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:53,030
ever using one before?
- Correct.

374
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:55,199
- But you didn't have
the autobiographical memories

375
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,969
that involved toothbrushes,
but you knew how to operate it

376
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,137
'cause that's
a procedural memory.

377
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:01,305
- Right.
- Exactly, exactly.

378
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:02,940
- Wow.
- Things like that,

379
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:06,310
you know, are stored in
a different part of the brain.

380
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:08,412
- So it was almost like

381
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,515
you were--you were born

382
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:14,285
into this person's body
you didn't get to choose.

383
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,120
You have a name,
you have a wife,

384
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,555
you have a house,
you have a past...

385
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:20,524
- Mm-hmm.
- And you have to just accept

386
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:23,260
that all of those
are what you've been dealt.

387
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,696
- Right, 'cause that's exactly
how I felt.

388
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:29,300
Like I stepped
into somebody else's life,

389
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,101
and...

390
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:33,137
a lot of it I didn't believe.

391
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,941
I just couldn't picture that,
you know, I flew airplanes

392
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,976
 or--or was in the NFL.

393
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:42,713
I just--seemed like
nothing I would ever do,

394
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:46,283
and a lot of it, you know,
she had to prove to me.

395
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:50,321
She put together
a whole album full of pictures.

396
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,624
 She kind of put my life
 in a chronological order...

397
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,193
 - Wow.
 - And that kind of, you know,

398
00:14:56,194 --> 00:15:00,331
 filled some of the gaps
 of who I was,

399
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,599
and I-I've heard that,
you know,

400
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,401
you are who you are

401
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:06,036
from the things
you've experienced

402
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:07,538
and your memories,

403
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,106
and when I hear that,

404
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,175
it's like a knife in my heart.

405
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,143
'Cause it's like,
"Then who am I?"

406
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,579
- So, Scott, when you're asked,
"Who are you?"

407
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,081
what do you say?

408
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,382
- It's hard to answer
that question

409
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,485
because I haven't
figured out who I am.

410
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:24,388
I'm developing every day

411
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,491
my personality and who I am,

412
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:30,394
but inside of my brain,

413
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:33,530
I don't know who I am.

414
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:41,405
 â™ª â™ª

415
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:44,475
- You are the collection
of all of your memories.

416
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,343
Right?
I mean, that's your story.

417
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,245
Those are things
that happened to you

418
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:51,682
and they're in the past.
They can't be changed.

419
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,651
But it can be created.

420
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,153
[film reel humming]

421
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,055
 An illuminating Harvard study

422
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:01,425
 found numerous examples
 of seemingly sane people

423
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:03,494
 who believed
 they had recovered memories

424
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,463
 of past lives
 and alien abductions,

425
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:08,065
 and there's no deceit.

426
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,666
 These people actually believe

427
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,535
 that these events occurred.

428
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:14,805
- And I remember I was
just literally scared to death.

429
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:18,409
 - Once people have decided
 that a memory is real,

430
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,112
the brain can fill in details
that never happened.

431
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:24,314
Especially
if the clues you're getting

432
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:27,751
or what people are telling you
isn't entirely accurate.

433
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:30,821
 Leading cognitive psychologist
 Elizabeth Loftus

434
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:34,091
 made that point
 in a 1996 experiment

435
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:37,227
 where she convinced
 over 25% of the subjects

436
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:40,264
 that they had been lost
 in a shopping mall as a child.

437
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,534
Your brain will just take
those untruths and run with them

438
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,470
and fill in details
out of nowhere.

439
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:50,407
Completely changing
your personal history.

440
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:54,311
 â™ª â™ª

441
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:56,747
 When we last saw
 our Who You Were subjects,

442
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:59,550
 they did not recall
 the false memory we planted.

443
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,485
When you were about
four or five years old...

444
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,153
- Mm-kay.
- You actually took a ride

445
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:06,155
in a hot air balloon,
but you dropped something.

446
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:08,325
- I'm not sure
if I remember that to be honest.

447
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:10,427
- You took a ride
in a hot air balloon,

448
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:11,795
and you dropped something.

449
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:13,864
- I don't remember that.

450
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:16,232
 - We've let the memory
 sink in over night,

451
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,602
 and today we're gonna see
 if physical stimuli

452
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,838
 will help solidify this story
 in their minds.

453
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,641
Today is all about you...
- Mm-hmm.

454
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:26,777
- And a little drive
down your memory lane.

455
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,580
- [laughs]
- This is where

456
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,316
you rode over
in a hot air balloon.

457
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,718
- [laughs]
In a hot air balloon?

458
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,886
- That's right.

459
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,554
- Maybe my parents mistaked me

460
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,823
for, like, a--another kid.
- Some other kid?

461
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:42,559
- [laughs]
- We'll get out and walk around

462
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,862
 and see what can come back.

463
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,697
Let it all soak in,

464
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,699
and tell me

465
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,467
if anything's
coming back to you.

466
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:52,236
- Hmm.

467
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,471
I don't know, man.
It's not--it's not popping up.

468
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:57,541
- You dropped something...
- [breathes deeply]

469
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,776
- When you were
in this hot air balloon.

470
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:02,212
 Will this be the detail
 that pushes Tim

471
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,348
 to remember the event?

472
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,649
- What could I have dropped?

473
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,884
What did I walk around with
back then?

474
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,486
 â™ª â™ª

475
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:11,321
 - I spent another 15 minutes

476
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:12,923
 attempting
 to kick-start Tim's brain

477
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:15,759
 with details
 of the false balloon story.

478
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,828
Has anything come back?

479
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:19,763
 â™ª â™ª

480
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,431
- No.
- Hmm.

481
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,267
- [laughs]

482
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,502
 - Tim's brain
 doesn't seem susceptible

483
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,937
 to the false memory.

484
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,773
 Let's check in
 with our other subjects.

485
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:33,544
This is where you took
your hot air balloon ride.

486
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

487
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:38,649
This is Echo Park?
- Yeah.

488
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,418
- And--
- It was about 15 years ago.

489
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,187
- Yeah.
- You don't remember any--

490
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,355
anything from this.
- No.

491
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:48,625
 - Of course he doesn't.
 It never happened.

492
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:51,828
This is where you took
your first hot air balloon ride.

493
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:54,331
- This is?
- This is it, yeah.

494
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:57,301
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

495
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,770
Does this bring back memories?

496
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,572
- Um...

497
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,607
 â™ª â™ª

498
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,876
- You don't remember anything
from this?

499
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:08,579
- Um...

500
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,348
I do remember,
like, something as a kid.

501
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:13,350
I-I dropped something.

502
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:14,851
 - He dropped something.

503
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:17,754
 Now how do you suppose
 he got that idea?

504
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,690
You dropped something.

505
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,959
 Dylan's mind
 is gradually taking

506
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,594
 an idea we planted

507
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,697
 and adopting it
 as his own memory detail.

508
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,766
- I could have been around here
riding my bike,

509
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,835
then we took
a hot air balloon ride,

510
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:35,005
and possibly dropped
a Superman cape.

511
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:36,540
 â™ª â™ª

512
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,008
 - For some people,

513
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,644
 physical sensations can be
 an effective trigger

514
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:44,514
 to bring back real
 or imaginary memories.

515
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:47,584
What about smells and sounds?

516
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:50,487
- Well, when I was
four or five when I was here,

517
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:52,856
I remember it smelling...

518
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:54,658
fresh.

519
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,761
 - This sensory memory
 may be a jumping off point

520
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,464
 to begin accepting
 the false memory.

521
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,634
You remember looking down
on the park from above?

522
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,803
- I might remember, um...

523
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:09,473
 â™ª â™ª

524
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,709
Being able
to overlook the water.

525
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,779
Um...

526
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,616
I remember, like, standing over
and squatting,

527
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,518
and, like,
just, li--

528
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,588
being so happy to be up there

529
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:27,758
and the wind
blowing my hair back,

530
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,560
and my dad kept
telling me to sit down,

531
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,563
and I wouldn't sit down.
- Yeah, you weren't scared.

532
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:36,066
- [laughs]
- How high up were you?

533
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:40,003
- Probably, like...

534
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:41,538
800 feet.

535
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:42,873
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

536
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,941
- Wow.

537
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:48,512
 Victoria's false memory
 is beginning to take hold

538
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,948
 with the help of her
imaginative subconscious brain.

539
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:55,385
What do you remember seeing
from up in the hot air balloon?

540
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:57,087
- The water fountain,
for sure...

541
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,523
- Yeah?
- And I could have been crazy,

542
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,491
but I think
that I could have felt,

543
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:04,428
like, almost a little bit
of mist hit my skin

544
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,063
from the water fountain.

545
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,665
- What color was the balloon?

546
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,500
- I wanna say it was red.

547
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,402
- Red.
- Yeah.

548
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:14,438
 Let's see if
 the seed I planted earlier

549
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,006
 has taken hold.

550
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,542
You took a ride
in a hot air balloon

551
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,644
and you dropped something.

552
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:22,546
- I don't remember that.

553
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,082
- You dropped something.
- I did.

554
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,617
At that age,
I was a huge Barney fan...

555
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,387
- Ah.
- And I just, like, remember

556
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:33,357
just, like--and looking down
and him just being gone.

557
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,759
- [laughs] About where
did it fall do you think?

558
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,762
- Um...I would say

559
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,498
six or seven blocks away.

560
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,666
- Oh, really?

561
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,134
So not in the water?
- No.

562
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,670
 - By now,
 it seems Victoria's brain

563
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,772
has turned our suggested memory

564
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,808
 into a complete
 childhood experience.

565
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,677
- I remember

566
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,645
waking up at, like,

567
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:58,081
9:00 in the morning,

568
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,883
getting in the car,

569
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:02,119
and then my mom and I
being in the car

570
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,820
having no idea
where we were going

571
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,422
'cause he loved to do that.

572
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:06,823
Just put the family in the car

573
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:09,059
and just go somewhere,
and just, like, surprise us.

574
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,662
 - Victoria is personalizing
 this false memory

575
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:14,898
 by merging it
 with pleasant details

576
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,767
 from her childhood.

577
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,503
- And next thing you know, like,
we're just, like, flying over,

578
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,472
like, the whole,
like, greater Los Angeles area.

579
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:26,109
- So who do you think was
in the basket with you?

580
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,078
- Well, definitely
both my parents.

581
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,880
I know we got something
to eat afterwards.

582
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,516
Almost I wanna say, like,
a churro or something like that.

583
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,484
- Post-balloon churro.
- Yeah.

584
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,520
[laughs] Yeah.
- It's a classic.

585
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,789
 - Now that
 our subjects are convinced

586
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,557
 that the balloon ride
 happened...

587
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,492
- [laughs]
- Oh, shit.

588
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,761
 - It's time
 for a reality check.

589
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,763
Tell your mom, uh, the memory.

590
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:48,832
- We went, like,
on a hot air balloon ride,

591
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,502
and I dropped,
I think, my Superman cape.

592
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:57,941
Why you looking like that?
- [laughing]

593
00:22:57,942 --> 00:23:01,478
No, Dylan.
That never happened.

594
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,146
That never happened.

595
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:05,549
- Wait, what?
- There was never

596
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,651
a balloon ride.

597
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,919
- We made the whole story up.

598
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,922
Well, you made most of it up.

599
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,624
- Oh, wow.
- But isn't that amazing?

600
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,828
 Because, remember,
 we planted that story.

601
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,629
- No, that is.
That's actually really crazy.

602
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,565
I-I was actually having these--

603
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,033
these, like,
weird, faint memories

604
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,502
of me, like, looking over,
like the pond,

605
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,070
and, like, you know--
I don't even know.

606
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,707
- Has Dylan been
to Echo Park before?

607
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,743
- Oh, wow.
 - And now it's Victoria's turn

608
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:36,012
 for a rude awakening
 from her father.

609
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:38,648
- Hi.
- The story is not true.

610
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,083
- What?

611
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:41,585
- You've never been
in a hot air balloon.

612
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,220
- What're you guys
talking about?

613
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,755
Why would you make that up?
- Did you truly believe

614
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:46,857
that you'd been
in a hot air balloon?

615
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,024
- Yes.

616
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,259
- You remembered
so many details...

617
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,861
- Yes.
- Of something

618
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,096
that never happened.
- Yes.

619
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,131
- How many times you been
in a hot air balloon?

620
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:56,900
- None.

621
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,802
- So what were you remembering?

622
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,871
- I'm not entirely sure

623
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,508
because I really do
feel like I have a memory.

624
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,943
- We all are susceptible
to this.

625
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:11,515
- I really felt like I had
experienced that experience.

626
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,917
 - And what about our YouTuber,
 Tim?

627
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,253
- Well, Tim, I'll tell you what.
It's not surprising

628
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,821
that you don't remember
anything from it.

629
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,723
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause it never happened.

630
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,725
- I knew it.
[laughing]

631
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,527
I was like, "Dude..."

632
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,195
 - Tim wasn't susceptible.

633
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:26,897
 But false memories are common

634
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,799
 and can have
 real-world implications.

635
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,235
 The innocence Project
 of the United States claims

636
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,070
 that faulty
 eye-witness memories

637
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:37,173
 account for 72% of convictions

638
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:39,776
 overturned by DNA evidence.

639
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:42,679
 â™ª â™ª

640
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,814
So who are you?

641
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:47,584
Well, how could you be
any one thing?

642
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,052
You are always changing.

643
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,922
 If you can lose track
 of your past,

644
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,658
 and your memories
 can be altered

645
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,992
 or implanted,

646
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:59,129
 in the end,
 who are you really?

647
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,598
 Maybe... 
you're the stories

648
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,733
you're telling yourself,

649
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:05,101
and as always,

650
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:11,308
thanks for watching.
