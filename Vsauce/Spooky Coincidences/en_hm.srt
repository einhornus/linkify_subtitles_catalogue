00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:22,899
Hi, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,529
You can practice speaking backwards, so when your words are reversed

3
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,899
their intelligible. But here's something
else that is weird.

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,329
The digits in the speed of light are
exactly the same

5
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,479
as the latitude of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,219
And, as the anagram genius has revealed, all the world's

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,269
a stage but if you rearrange the letters
in the meaning of life

8
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,349
it becomes be engine of a film

9
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,579
or, more pessimistically, the fine game of nil.

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,619
What does all of this mean?

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,399
Are these just coincidences?

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,879
Or are greater powers at work?

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,139
Why is it so easy for us to find

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,029
hidden messages? Why can a mere
coincidence give us chills

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,019
and why is it so fun?

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,489
When you reverse Neil Armstrong saying 'small step for man'

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:30,879
you can hear what sounds like man will
space walk

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,809
Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated
President John F Kennedy

19
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,438
and this interview he defends the Fair
Play for Cuba committee

20
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:50,719
of which he was a member. 

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,819
Now listen to what it
sounds like when we reverse him saying

22
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:06,828
'and the Fair Play for Cuba'.

23
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:13,999
is that a coincidence or a subconscious
confession hidden within his own words?

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,089
It's a coincidence.

25
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,639
For crying out loud, if anybody says 'and
the Fair Play for Cuba',

26
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,139
and then reverses it, it sounds the same.

27
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,349
This app, by the way, is called
Virtual Recorder.

28
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,629
It's a really easy way to quickly reverse
your own speech.

29
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,419
Matthew Hutson in 'The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking' points out that if you record

30
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,879
yourself saying

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,729
and then reverse it

32
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,119
it sounds a bit like happy birthday to
you

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,059
Kind of.

34
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,859
If a word can be spelt the
same forward

35
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,339
and backward, it's a palindrome.

36
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,889
But if a word or phrase

37
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,789
sounds the same, whether spoken forward
or rewound,

38
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,369
it is a phonetic palindrome.

39
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,239
For example,

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,849
say yes. Reversed

41
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:29,479
Pretty cool. But  check out this poem by
Karsten Johansson

42
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,629
By the way, some people can speak in
reverse on the fly

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,589
It is really cool to see them in action.

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,989
Watch Guy's lean back

45
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,519
after this video. It's linked down in the
description and it's full of pretty cool coincidence videos.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,609
Apophenia is the perception of
connections or patterns

47
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,109
in information.

48
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,029
One type of Apophenia is Pareidolia -

49
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,119
the scene or hearing of things that
weren't meant to be there.

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,449
For instance, hearing your name being
called or your phone ringing

51
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,229
in the sound of running water, or
hearing English words

52
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,699
in a non-English song or seeing faces

53
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,959
that weren't purposely placed there. Our
brains are good at this kind of work,

54
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,269
probably because being hyper
attentive to patterns and faces

55
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,508
can save your life. If there's ambiguity
as to whether that

56
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,448
thing hiding in the shadows is a threat, or just a shadow,

57
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:26,529
it's advantageous to air on the side

58
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,769
of threat. Organisms with a healthy sense of Apophenia

59
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,189
live longer, long enough to have kids and
raise them

60
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,829
and naturally become the norm. We connect
with

61
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,969
faces so well Hutson relates a story of
a friend who draws

62
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,129
faces on things she doesn't wanna lose,
like her bags.

63
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,859
She says the faces make her less likely to
forget about them.

64
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,529
If you like it, you should have put a
ring on it, if you like not losing it,

65
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,649
you should have drawn a face on it.

66
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,449
We are so good at

67
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,819
teasing out patterns and faces from
random noise

68
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,179
actual random sequences don't always

69
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,019
feel random to us.

70
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,069
Originally, Apple's iTunes shuffle feature generated
complaints from users.

71
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,699
They said that similar songs, or songs
from the same artist,

72
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,059
appeared in a string, which, of course, is
to be expected

73
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,419
from randomness but it didn't feel
random enough.

74
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,129
So Apple introduced a smart shuffle

75
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,909
that avoided totally random sequences
that nonetheless

76
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,779
didn't seem random to our pattern
loving brains.

77
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,599
As Steve Jobs explained, "we're making it
less random

78
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,109
to make it feel more random".

79
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,319
Our impressive ability to imagine
patterns also expresses itself when it

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,849
comes to connecting songs

81
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,019
and moving images. This dancing
Spider-Man animation will

82
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,719
famously sync up with any music you play.

83
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,529
Try it. What kind of black magic is going on
here?

84
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,479
Well, as it turns out, most of it is in
our heads.

85
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,459
Radiolab reported that Michigan
State University explains that the major movements

86
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,979
of dancing animations like this one, or this one,

87
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,059
move at typical song tempos but also
contain, like most

88
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,729
dance, various other different related rhythms of movement allowing them to seemingly 

89
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,699
fit many different tempos.

90
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,379
Selection bias helps a lot too.

91
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,979
We fall prey to this when we reject all the times the animation

92
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,629
doesn't really sync up, focusing instead
on the more surprising times

93
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,009
when it does.

94
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,989
The bizarre pyramid coincidence mentioned earlier

95
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,989
is a lot less bizarre when you consider
the fact that we got to control where

96
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,819
we placed the decimal point,

97
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,749
and that a number of degrees this precise
isn't necessary to locate the pyramid.

98
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,319
By the fourth decimal we're only talking
about a matter of a few meters,

99
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,409
so it's easy to make the rest fit the
speed of light exactly

100
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,519
and have still picked a point on the pyramid.

101
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,689
Confirmation bias also comes into play here.

102
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,909
If you really want two things to sync up,

103
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,969
they will.

104
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,289
We often look for evidence that supports
what we already believe,

105
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,289
while marginalising things against it.

106
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,559
As Marshall McLuhan said "I wouldn't
have seen it, if I hadn't believed it".

107
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,788
These biases also help explain
the seemingly mind-blowing coincidence that

108
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:27,319
famous movies and famous albums can line up.

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,099
One the most popular states that if you
start playing Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon

110
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,719
at the same time as The Wizard of Oz,
they will eerily

111
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,579
line up. Entire communities have sprouted
around the syncing

112
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,989
of movies and albums. Some of my
favorites are the Yellow Submarine soundtrack

113
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,559
and the Little Mermaid, Lorde's Pure Heroine and Twilight Saga - Breaking Dawn 2,

114
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,168
and the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey

115
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,328
with Pink Floyd's Echoes.

116
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,788
There are conspiracies

117
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:00,098
that these were somehow secretly planned, though in reality

118
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:05,379
they're just accidental music videos. The
product of selection bias,

119
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,499
confirmation bias and

120
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,279
the law of near enough.

121
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,279
A behaviour of our pattern sensitive
minds.

122
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,959
Two things don't have to line up exactly, or literally,

123
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,859
for us to see a connection. This is why
vague predictions

124
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,408
are a great way to look psychic. These
are also actually

125
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:28,209
unsurprising when you consider the fact
that the number of narrative

126
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,819
paces and rhythms we enjoy, and
typically use,

127
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,119
are much smaller than the number possible.

128
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,769
In 'The Improbability Principal', David J
Hand calls this

129
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,399
"the probability lever".

130
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,019
What may be rare

131
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,519
on average, or when considering all
possible scenarios,

132
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,789
can be less rare for specific scenarios,

133
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,708
even if they are only marginally
different. Getting struck by lightning

134
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,958
is a proverbially unlikely event, but
Walter Summerford

135
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,189
wasn't just struck by lightning once
during his life,

136
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,229
he was struck three times. It never

137
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,229
killed him but four years after his
death

138
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,859
his gravestone was also struck by
lightning.

139
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,399
What are the chances? I mean, clearly
Summerford was some sort of

140
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,109
robot built out of lightning rods or had somehow angered Zeus,

141
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,299
right?

142
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,209
Probably not. You see, while for the
average person

143
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,869
the chance have been struck by lightning
is quite low, for an avid outdoor

144
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,289
sportsman like Summerford,

145
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,209
it's not as low.

146
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,209
The law of truly large numbers

147
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,739
also comes into play here.

148
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,619
With lightning striking Earth forty to
fifty times a second, billions of people

149
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,829
for it to strike and

150
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,989
thousand of years of recorded history, it's
actually not surprising at all

151
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,989
that at least once a story like Summerford's

152
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,859
would have happened.

153
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,189
Given the truly large number of people

154
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,179
who visit Disney World every day, and the fact that they take photos and lots of them,

155
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,789
it's actually not surprising at all that
at least one so far,

156
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,079
a story like Alex and Donna Voutsinas' has happened.

157
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,319
While sorting through old photos before
their wedding, Alex and Donna found a photo

158
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,169
of Donna

159
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,449
at Disney World, fourteen years before
the couple met.

160
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,899
But then Alex noticed something. He too had visited Disney World as a child, and there,

161
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,719
in the background, was his father pushing
him in a stroller.

162
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,149
Sometimes coincidences can be tragic.

163
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,759
In 1864, Abraham Lincoln's son,

164
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,849
Robert Lincoln, was saved from
serious injury - or possibly even

165
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,909
death - when a stranger grabbed him by the shirt collar

166
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,259
moments before he plunged on the train
tracks below.

167
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,269
That stranger turned out to be Edwin
Booth, one of the most famous

168
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,679
Shakespearean actors of the time. So famous in fact Robert recognized him

169
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,639
and had a letter sent thanking him
for saving his life. Less than a year later

170
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,299
Edwin Booth's brother, John Wilkes Booth,
undid the favor by

171
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,619
assassinating Abraham Lincoln.

172
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,169
Strange as they seem at first,

173
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,619
math says that given enough time and
psychology says that given enough interest

174
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,849
in finding them,

175
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,909
coincidences and connections will be found,

176
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,649
even unlikely ones. The coincidences between

177
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,039
Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy are famous.

178
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,819
Both were elected to the presidency in
the year ending with sixty.

179
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,119
Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theatre,

180
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,669
Kennedy was shot in a 1961 Lincoln
Continental four-door convertible,

181
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,669
made by Ford.

182
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,109
Both presidents' last names have seven letters

183
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,489
and both assassins had 15 letters in
their names.

184
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,699
The list goes on, as it should.

185
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,199
If you look long enough, you can find
coincidences between any two people or

186
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,349
things or events.

187
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,939
They may seem strange at first but tend to
wind up being in the end

188
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,349
pretty expected. For just one example,

189
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,839
name length isn't that wildly variable.

190
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,269
Seven-letter names are pretty common.
Lincoln,

191
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,779
Kennedy. Michael. Stevens

192
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,719
In the famous spooky presidential
coincidences contest,

193
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,579
held by the Skeptical Inquirer in 1992,
one contestant alone

194
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,789
found similar lists of crazy
coincidences

195
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,799
between 21 pairs of former presidents.

196
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,589
Given the vast amount of details in any one
of our lives,

197
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,029
it's pretty easy. This court can be
exploited to almost comedic heights

198
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,439
when it comes to over-analysing.

199
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,389
Of course, hidden messages and signs are often intentionally included in media

200
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,569
for fun, or to reward attentive viewers.

201
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,929
But unintentional, extraordinary things

202
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,939
happen all the time. It's not really that extraordinary.

203
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,649
There's a famous calculation

204
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,929
that is known as Littlewood's law. Given
the number of hours

205
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,999
we are awake every day, and
assuming an event only takes about a second to occur,

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,099
if you calculate the odds of something happening to you are only one in a million.

207
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,479
Well, you should expect that thing to
happen to you about once every 35 days.

208
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,239
David J Hand took this even further with seven billion people on Earth

209
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,139
the chance that an event with a
one in a million probability of happening

210
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,379
to each of us won't happen today is
1

211
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,249
in 10 to 3040. As Persi Diaconis put it,

212
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,049
the truly unusual day would be a day
where

213
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,619
nothing unusual happens.

214
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,759
And as always,

215
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,079
thanks for watching.

216
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,189
You may have noticed a lot of YouTube
channels making videos about learning this week.

217
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,979
Well, that is not a coincidence. It is
school of YouTube week.

218
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,349
Many people are going back
to school or college right now

219
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,179
but across the world millions of children won't be

220
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,499
either because they work to
support their families

221
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,119
or live without a home. Or in areas
where there is conflict.

222
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,459
They may experience overcrowding at school or a lack of teaching

223
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,309
and school supplies. But luckily, we can help.

224
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,709
Donations to Comic Relief's School of
YouTube campaign

225
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,139
can help disadvantaged young people all
around the world

226
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,389
get an education. It doesn't take much to
change a life.

227
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,499
You can learn more in the description below or donate right now.

228
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,100
And as always, thanks for helping and thanks for learning.
