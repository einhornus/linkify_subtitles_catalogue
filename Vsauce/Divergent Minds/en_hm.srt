00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,112
[Michael] Derek, have you
 ever watched Mind Field

3
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:16,147
on YouTube?

4
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:19,150
No, but I would like
to watch it, Michael.

5
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:20,385
[Michael] Okay.

6
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:22,420
So Mind Field
has a theme song

7
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:24,155
that I'd love
for you to listen to

8
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:27,158
to see if you can play it
for me on the piano.

9
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,561
I would like to listen to it,
Michael.

10
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,698
All right.
Just load this up here.

11
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:44,242
[theme music playing]

12
00:00:44,243 --> 00:01:08,199
[playing piano]

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,601
Oh, hello.

14
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,770
This is a tray of brains.

15
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:13,738
Cow brains.

16
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,475
Here is a sagittal slice
I prepared earlier.

17
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:20,345
Now, imagine that
this is my brain.

18
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,547
Just looking at it,
it would be impossible to know

19
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,249
what part does what

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,384
or that different parts
did different things at all.

21
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:29,754
But if you change
specific parts of your brain,

22
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:32,190
you can often affect
specific functions.

23
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,859
So if this was my brain...

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,661
that would be pretty bad.

25
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:37,862
I would almost certainly

26
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:40,398
have just become
cortically bind.

27
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,168
Of course, scientists can't go
cutting and poking

28
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,469
and stabbing people's brains

29
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,937
to see how it affects
their behavior,

30
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:49,374
but they can study the behavior
and abilities of people

31
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,644
whose brains are different
from neurotypical brains.

32
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,612
 For instance, in rare cases,

33
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:56,614
 people whose eyes
 function normally

34
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:59,717
but who are blind due to damage
 to their visual cortex

35
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:02,187
 may experience
 the neurological phenomenon

36
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,655
 of blindsight

37
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,523
 which allows them
 to sense and respond

38
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:07,926
 to objects they cannot see.

39
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,228
 Due to a brain injury,
 this patient

40
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,964
 is consciously blind
 on his right side.

41
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,934
 But while he sees nothing
 in his right field of vision,

42
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,503
 he's able to sense
 the presence and motion

43
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:20,705
 of an object he cannot see.

44
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,340
[man] You're moving it
 up and down.

45
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:23,708
 I am aware of a motion,

46
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,410
 but that motion has no shape,

47
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,512
 no color, no depth,
 no form, no contrast.

48
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:28,813
[Michael] Blindsight is possible

49
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:30,715
 because besides
 the visual cortex

50
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:32,817
 which is associated
 with conscious vision,

51
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,619
 there are other brain areas

52
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,589
 that get information
 from the eyes unconsciously.

53
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,925
 We have learned about this
 unconscious vision we all have

54
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,361
 because of blindsight.

55
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,263
 The study of divergent minds

56
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,966
has revolutionized
our understanding of the brain

57
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,935
in ways that would not have been
possible otherwise.

58
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,704
People who differ from the norm

59
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,373
expose elements
of all our minds

60
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,508
that we didn't even know
were there.

[upbeat music playing]

63
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,687
[Michael] One very special
 divergent mind

64
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,723
 is that of Derek Paravicini.

65
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,258
Let's go.
We're gonna count a hundred

66

-Okay. Yeah.

00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:15,393

three...

70
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:20,698
[Michael] Derek is both
 blind and autistic.

71
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,934
 He's also a musical savant...

72
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,802
Now for the live music
you were promised.

73
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:26,671
[Michael] ...meaning despite
 severe cognitive

74
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:28,273
 and social impairments,

75
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,041
 his musical ability
 is far greater

76
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,510
 than what would be
 considered normal.

77
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:34,979
 And tonight, he's performing
 at the release party

78
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,814
 for his latest album.

79
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:40,752
[playing "Flight
of the Bumblebees"]

80
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,288
 Derek possesses
 an incredible gift.

81
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,056
 He's performed
 all over the world

82
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,058
 and has become
 a symbol of success

83
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:57,935
for other autistic individuals.

84
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:01,839
Later, we'll take a deeper look
 into Derek's unique mind.

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,976
Thank you.

86
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:11,015
[upbeat music playing]

87
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,817
[Michael] One hundred
 and fifty years ago,

88
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,786
scientists still didn't know

89
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,989
if different parts of the brain
did different things.

90
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,725
It was only by studying people
with atypical minds

91
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,461
 that we discovered that
 there are different modules

92
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,663
in the brain that have
different functions.

93
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:27,532
The first major discovery

94
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,568
showing that the brain had
these specialized modules

95
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,372
was made by a doctor
named Paul Broca in the 1800s.

96
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:36,708
Broca had heard of a patient
who had no problem

97
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,376
understanding language,

98
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:41,079
but who struggled
to produce language.

99
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,747
The only thing the patient
could say

100
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:44,849
was the sound "tan,"

101
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,017
over and over.

102
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,719
He would say tan,

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,722
tan, tan, tan, tan, tan, tan,
tan, tan, tan, tan, tan.

104
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,889
When the patient died,

105
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,758
Broca performed
an autopsy on him

106
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,360
and found that
the patient's brain

107
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,961
had damage to a specific part

108
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,930
 of its left hemisphere.

109
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,998
 Broca concluded
 that this brain region,

110
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,934
 now called Broca's Area,

111
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,470
must be important
for producing speech

112
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,839
but not
for understanding speech.

113
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,975
This language deficit
called Broca's Aphasia

114
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,411
still affects hundreds
of thousands of people

115
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:16,013
who get strokes
in the left side of their brain.

116
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,850
A patient with Broca's Aphasia
can talk,

117
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,552
but struggles
to get the words out.

118
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,922
[woman] So what's your name?

119
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,057
Scott.

120
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:30,027
Oh, no.

121
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,996
-Sarah Scott.
-[woman] That's right.

122
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:38,669
And how old are you?

123
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,737
I can't.

124
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:42,907
-[woman] Try.
-I can't.

125
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,643
[Michael] Another part
of the brain related to speech

126
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:47,645
 is Wernicke's Area

127
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:50,481
 which is associated
 with language comprehension.

128
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,450
 Patients who damage
 this region

129
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,885
 can speak fluenty

130
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,753
 but they are unabe
 to understand languae

131
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:58,523
 or use it in a meaningful wa.

132
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,992
[woman] What were we just doing
with the iPad?

133
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:04,662
Right at the moment
a darn should-- a darn thing.

134
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:08,466
[woman] With the iPad
that we were doing.

135
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:09,934
Like here?

136
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:13,571
I'd like my change for me
and change hands for me.

137
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:14,772
It was happy.

138
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:16,808
I would talk with Donna
sometimes.

139
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,009
We're all with them.

140
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,545
Other people are working
with them, them.

141
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,079
I'm very happy with them.

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,549
These remarkable individuals
have taught us a lot

143
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,451
about the neural basis
of language.

144
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,453
But it can be tricky
to infer the functions

145
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,620
of different brain areas

146
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,089
based only
on specific patients.

147
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,193
That's because damage is almost
never confined to one spot

148
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,929
and the brain
can reorganize itself

149
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,697
after it's been damaged.

150
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:42,934
So to get a more precise picture
of how changing the brain

151
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,869
affects behavior and function,

152
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,704
I went to UCLA

153
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:49,974
to have my brain damaged.

154
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,476
But not permanently.

155
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,844
I'm not gonna have
a piece of my brain

156
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:53,945
removed and thrown away.

157
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:57,048
Instead, I'm going to have
part of my brain tissue

158
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,218
temporarily
and safely disrupted

159
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,986
by a technology called

160
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,956
transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

161
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:10,795
Here I go.

162
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,597
Usually I start

163
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,932
by saying I'm glad to be here.

164
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,235
I'm medium to be here.

165
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,170
I'm a little anxious about
what's about to happen.

166
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,138
Today, you're going
to be giving me

167
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,875
a brain lesion,
temporarily.

168
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,644
So I should cease to be able
to produce words.

169
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,145
Right.

170
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:30,081
That actually just sounds
very frightening.

171
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,584
I like to be in control,
especially of myself.

172
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:44,862
Should I be worried?

173
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:47,098
[Michael] Transcranial
 magnetic stimulation,

174
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,766
 or TMS for short,

175
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,601
applies a strong magnetic pulse

176
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:51,903
 to one part of the brain

177
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,005
 such as Broca's Area.

178
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,207
 This briefly disrupts
 electric function

179
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,709
 in the part of the brain
 that is stimulated.

180
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,279
 It's like causing
 temporary brain damage.

181
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,147
 But as soon as
 the pulse is over,

182
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:05,716
 functioning
 goes back to normal.

183
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,852
 While it's not guaranteed
 that TMS

184
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,620
 will affect
 my ability to speak,

185
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,590
 Dr. Iacoboni
 has successfully stimulated

186
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,793
 Broca's Aphasia
 on other test subjects.

187
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,995
Transcranial
magnetic stimulation,

188
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:19,664
to see what happens when such...

00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,167
-[clicking]
-[indistinct speech]

190
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,836
...tradition
of studying individuals.

191
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:29,073
[Michael] Now it was time
 to have my speech disrupted.

192
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:31,609
 But to stimulate
 my Broca's Area,

193
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,144
 first, we had to find it

194
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,314
using an MRI scan of my brain.

195
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,783
Hopefully, we'll be able to find
Broca's Area

196
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,920
and shut me up.

197
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,755
[John] So it's gonna feel
a little bit like

198
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,357
somebody tapping
on your scalp,

199
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,892
and you might feel

200
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:50,061
some superficial
muscle stimulation.

201
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,329
-Uh-hmm.
-[John] So this will

202
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,231
probably be
a little bit uncomfortable.

203
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:56,867
It might be
a lot uncomfortable.

204
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,336
If it becomes too much,

205
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,005
just say the word stop,
and we will stop.

206
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,106
Okay.

207
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,108
I'm just gonna pull out

208
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,745
the first chapter
of Pride and Prejudice

209
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,647
by Jane Austen

210
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,215
and I'll just
start reading,

211
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,985
and you guys will start
stimulating my Broca's Area.

212
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,121
"'My dear Mr. Bennet,'
said his lady to him one day,

213
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,889
"'Have you heard that
Netherfield Park

214
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,057
-"'is let at last?'
-[clicking]

215
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,393
"Mr. Bennet replied
that he had not.

216
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,761
"'But it is,'
returned she,

217
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,329
"'for Mrs. Long
has just been here

218
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,331
"'and she told me
all about it."

219
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:28,933
"Mr. Bennet made no answer.

220
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,701
"'Do you not want to know
who has taken it?'

221
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:32,370
"cried his wife impatiently.

222
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,905
"'You want to tell me and I have
no objection to hearing it.'

223
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,407
This was invitation enough."

224
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,242
 We tried a couple of times,

225
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,778
 but my Broca's Area seemed
 to be playing hard to get.

226
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,381
 So we repositioned
 the machine.

227
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,383
New trajectory.

228
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,284
Enter.

229
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:48,719
Okay, great.

230
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,920
"'You and the girls may go,

231
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,389
'or you may send them
by themselves,

232
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,157
'which perhaps
will be better still,

00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,092

'When a woman

236
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,765
After several more attempts,

237
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,901
 we were still unsuccessful
 at finding my Broca's Area

238
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:04,902
 and disrupting my speech.

239
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:10,975
"...married, its solace
was visiting and news."

240
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:18,215
I beat it.

241
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,117
Yeah, no. You cannot stop

242
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:21,986
her from being heard.

243
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:24,088
 While neuromapping
 allows us to locate

244
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,157
 the many different areas
 of the brain,

245
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,226
 the brain is one of the most
 complex organs in our body

246
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:32,463
 and not all brains respond
 to TMS in the same way.

247
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,799
 TMS didn't work on me
 this time,

248
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,402
 but different test subjects
 produce different results.

249
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:44,008
Is find out what....
[indistinct]

250
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,977
Okay, that's probably good
for now.

251
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:49,280
[Michael] TMS is currently
 being evaluated

252
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,848
 to treat depression

253
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,717
 and certain types
 of brain damage.

254
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,985
 One day, it may even be used

255
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:58,989
 to reduce the effects
 of traumatic brain injury.

256
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,993
[upbeat music playing]

257
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:04,962
[Michael] I traveled to London
 to meet someone

258
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,831
 who was using
 his divergent mind

259
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,100
 in an extraordinary way.

260
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,001
Derek, it's Michael.

261
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,336
-Oh, hello, Michael.
-Nice to meet you.

262
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,437
I'm Derek. How are you?

263
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:14,939
Would you like
to come in, Michael?

264
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,173
I'm fantastic.
I would love to come in.

265
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:17,875
Yes. It's an honor.

266
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:22,012
I wanted to find out what Derek
could teach us about all brains.

267
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:24,482
So Derek, I'm doing a show
called Mind Field

268
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,816
about psychology.

269
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,418
Do you know psychology?

270
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:29,754
I do know psychology.

271
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,989
Your brain
is different than mine.

272
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,257
Would you agree?

273
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:34,825
I would agree, Michael.

274
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:37,328
-It's different
than my brain, yes.
-Yes.

275
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,430
 It became evident
 very quickly

276
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:42,466
 that this was going to be
 an atypical interview.

277
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,802
I'm sure you hear
all the time

278
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:47,438
about how spectacular
your abilities are.

279
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,373
Were you told that
even at a young age

280
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:52,910
when you first started
to interact with a piano?

281
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,311
I was told at a young age

282
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:58,249
when I first started
to interact with a piano...

283
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,017
[Michael] Derek has echolalia,

284
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:02,553
a condition which causes him
 to repeat back words

285
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:04,088
 spoken to him.

286
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,323
 It's his way
 of trying to understand

287
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:07,858
 the spoken word.

288
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:11,195
You can learn music
just by listening to it.

289
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:15,065
I can learn music
by listening to it, Michael.

290
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,901
[Michael]
 But while Derek may find

291
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,435
 spoken language challenging,

292
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:22,006
he has no problem communicating
 through music.

293
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,976
[playing jazz]

294
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:29,046
 There are about seven million
 autistic savants worldwide

295
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,081
 with some level
 of savant skills,

296
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:36,187
 but Derek is what's known
 as a prodigious savant...

297
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,023
 which means that his musical
 skills are so outstanding

298
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,125
 that they would be
 considered spectacular

299
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:44,395
 even for highly trained
 neurotypical musicians.

300
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,964
 There are probably fewer than
 a hundred prodigious savants

301
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:50,100
 in the whole world.

302
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,902
[Alan] Derek Paravicini
 has a musicality

303
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:54,572
 that I think any performer
 would envy.

304
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,841
What sort of music
do you really love, Derek?

305
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,342
Uh, maybe
pop music or...

306
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:00,544
-Okay.
-Jazz, Derek?

307
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:02,947
A bit of jazz, yeah.

308
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,381
[Michael]
 Since he was five years old,

309
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:07,184
 Derek has been mentored
 by Adam Ockelford.

310
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:10,187
Through the door.
Well done, Derek.

311
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,323
 [Michael]
 Adam is a music psychologist,

312
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,458
 author, and professor

313
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,360
 at the University
 of Roehampton.

314
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:19,029
That's your right hand,
now do your left hand.

315
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,435
Go on.

316
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,604
Derek was born very premature.

317
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,305
 Twenty-six weeks,

318
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,141
which thirty-eight
years ago was very,
very premature.

319
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:32,910
And they didn't
have any equipment

320
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:34,378
in the hospital for him.

321
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,513
So they rushed him
into the nearest hospital

322
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:39,083
that had an incubator,
and Derek

323
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,418
wasn't thought able
to survive, and yet he did.

324
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,020
He's such a fighter.

325
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,022
Because of the circumstances
of his birth

326
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:48,058
and the impact of blindness
and learning difficulties,

327
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,395
his brain developed
in a particular kind of way.

328
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:54,899
As a little boy, he was
very fascinated by sound,

329
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,233
not being able to see.

330
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:59,570
And his nanny gave him
this little electric organ

331
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,906
and that was like
a eureka moment for him

332
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,108
and the beginnings
of his music

333
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,242
processing ability.

334
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:07,344
So things like language,
things like

335
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,380
perhaps understanding
how people feel,

336
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,182
these things are very
difficult for Derek.

337
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:14,919
And yet his music
is way above average.

338
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,420
Derek's got
an amazingly quick ear,

339
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:17,521
haven't you, Derek?

340
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:21,158
-I have, yes.
-If I go like...

341
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,260
or...

342
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:26,030
or...

343
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,331
He can process
an amazing...

344
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,033
-[Michael] It's like automatic.
-Yeah.

345
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,567
[Michael]
That's impressive, Derek.

346
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:32,236
Thank you, Michael.

347
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:34,605
Yeah, no, the response
to pitch that you make, Derek,

348
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,106
is incredibly fast.

349
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,142
We've measured the time
between playing

350
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:42,313
even a big chord,
say like this one.

351
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,950
And Derek can listen and react

352
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,485
to an eight-note chord
within about 0.4 of a second.

353
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:52,556
-Wow.
-Derek's sense of pitch
is very unusual.

354
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,326
-It's also known as perfect.
-It is. It is perfect.

355
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,294
 Something like 40% of babies

356
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,330
 born premature
 who lose their sight

357
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,365
 have perfect pitch
 as opposed to

358
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:04,435
 about one in ten thousand
in the neurotypical population.

359
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,071
 So you can see that

360
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,739
 the impact of not being
 able to see

361
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,375
has a massive effect on
the way the brain develops.

362
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:14,144
And how does autism
play into this?

363
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,447
Well, autism
is an added factor.

364
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,049
Autism starts at very early
in life, we know that.

365
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,617
And in Derek's case,
of course,

366
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,453
when he came out
of the incubator.

367
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,322
And what autism tends
to do is to give children

368
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:28,592
this immense focus
on the sheer quality of things,

369
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,394
whether it's a sound or a--

370
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,596
or a color or a scent.

371
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,732
That's the quality
that we all have as babies,

372
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,669
that we experience the world
in this sheer perception.

373
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,506
Now most babies very quickly
come out of that

374
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,141
by 12, 18 months.

375
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,010
They're starting
to categorize things

376
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,645
just to make sense of the amount
of information that's coming in.

377
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,647
So you're born,
and your body is, like,

378
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,384
consuming all
of this sense data raw.

379
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,253
-Yeah.
-[Michael] And then
it learns that's crazy.

380
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:58,522
 We don't need to process
 every little detail.

381
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,457
 We only need to understand
 what's important

382
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,260
 or relevant,
 and that's enough.

383
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,095
[Adam] It's called
categorical perception,

384
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,563
and that is a much more
efficient way

385
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:07,698
of processing information,
and of course

386
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,299
that's why
the brain does it.

387
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,036
But autistic children,
they hang on to those

388
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,637
absolute qualities
for longer.

389
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:16,073
For people like Derek,
and since he's not only

390
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:19,376
got those fantastically
vivid absolute memories,

391
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:22,579
he's also learned
the rules of music

392
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,717
but it's built on this--
on this foundation of perceptual

393
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:32,623
vividness that
we can only grasp at.

394
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,125
[Michael] While most people
 would find it impossible

395
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:37,394
 to identify all
 of the individual notes

396
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,596
 in a 10- or 20-note chord,

397
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:42,166
 Derek is able to do
 this with ease,

398
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,334
 which means
 he can decipher more notes

399
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:46,670
 than he can play at once
 with two hands.

400
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,072
So we could do that.
If I...

401
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,473
Actually, I have--
I have hands.

402
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,175
-We could combine.
-Yes, yes, yeah.

403
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,244
So-- right, so if you play those
two notes with that hand.

404
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:58,248
-[Michael] Yup.
-And those two with that hand.

405
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:05,856
And we'll count for it, okay?
One, two, three, four.

406
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,291
-There you are.
-[Michael] What was
all the fiddling?

407
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,094
[Adam] Well, the fiddling
was to make it--

408
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,096
because he couldn't reach them
all at the same time.

409
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,597
-[Michael] Right.
-[Adam] So his--
he was splitting them up.

410
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:15,699
[Michael] He's just playing--
but they were all--

411
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,836
they were all in there.
He just couldn't all play
them at once.

412
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,838
 But as amazing
 as his musical ear is,

413
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,142
 Derek's cognitive abilities
 are less than rudimentary.

414
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:26,677
[Adam] Derek, should we do
some more chords?

415
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,645
[Derek] We'll do some
more chords, Adam.

416
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:31,582
-So can you play this for me?
-[Derek] Yes, Adam.

417
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,584
Ready?

418
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,186
Good. And do you know how many
notes there are, Derek?

419
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:37,588
-[Derek] I'm not sure.
-[Adam] Have a guess.

420
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,556
How many do you think?

421
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,758
-Is it one?
-[Adam] Yeah,
a bit more than one.

422
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,895
-So there's one.
-One, two, three,

423
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,765
four, five, six.

424
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:51,401
-[Adam]
Six, weren't there? Right.
-[Derek] There's six, Adam.

425
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,537
[Adam] Good.
Now try this one then, Derek.

426
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,839
Ready and...

427
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,275
[Derek] Is it one note, Adam?

428
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,444
[Adam] No, there are five.
One, two, three, four, five.

429
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:02,212
[Derek]
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:06,283
It is one, two, three,
four, five, Adam.

431
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:07,551
[Michael] Tell me more
 about how limited

432
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:10,387
Derek's everyday abilities are.

433
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,756
Derek finds
almost everything

434
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:16,160
that you or I do without
thinking really difficult.

435
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,663
So self-care,
things like getting dressed,

436
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:22,332
getting washed in the morning
are tricky for him.

437
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,935
So all those things
that we take for granted,

438
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:26,837
he finds really difficult.

439
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,338
-[Cynthia] Derek?
-[Derek] Yes?

440
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:29,640
[Cynthia] We'll have
to clean your mouth.

441
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,909
[Derek] Could you clean
my mouth now, Cynthia?

442
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,644
[Cynthia] Yes.
Can you come to the sink?

443
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,445
[Derek] I can come
to the sink.

444
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,614
 [Adam] And in fact,
 38 years on, we're saying

445
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:39,416
"Well, does it really
matter if Derek

446
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,751
"can't put his socks
on himself?

447
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,719
You know,
there are other things in life."

448
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,323
And-- and yet when
he touches the piano,

449
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:47,758
everything's reversed.

450
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,260
So things that we would find
inconceivably difficult,

451
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,728
Derek does it as easy
as breathing.

452
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:54,198
And if you ask him,
"Derek, how'd you do that?"

453
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,432
he has no idea,

454
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:57,501
any more than you
or I understand

455
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:59,636
how we breathe
or how we speak or...

456
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,338
-Yeah.
-It's purely intuitive.

457
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:13,684
[playing ragtime]

458
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,352
[Michael] In addition
 to entertaining people

459
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,221
with his remarkable abilities,

460
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,855
 Derek offers valuable insight

461
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,291
 to scientists
 who study the mind.

462
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,428
What do you think Derek
is helping us learn

463
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,663
about this thing
in our head?

464
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,599
I think what
Derek's example tells us

465
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,768
is the almost infinite
capacity of the human brain

466
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:33,770
to not only survive

467
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:37,241
but thrive in incredibly
difficult circumstances.

468
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,476
And Derek's potential

469
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,545
really was no different
from anyone else's.

470
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:44,815
There's no one in his family
who were particularly musical.

471
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,683
So in a sense, you could say
that we all have

472
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,885
Derek's potential
when we're born.

473
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,788
But fortunately, of course,
we don't have his disadvantages

474
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:55,292
and what gave Derek
his massive advantage

475
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,027
is at the cost
of his disadvantages.

476
00:19:57,028 --> 00:20:04,368
[upbeat music playing]

477
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,670
Autism still
isn't well understood.

478
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:08,305
 One of the many theories
 for the cause

479
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,907
of autistic people's heightened
 sensory awareness

480
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:13,810
is that it's at least partially
 due to an abnormality

481
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:15,812
in the brain's left hemisphere,

482
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:19,349
 permitting a vast amount
 of sensory details

483
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,585
 to enter
 the brain's awareness.

484
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:25,422
Neurotypical brains may receive
 all the same sensory details

485
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:29,559
but block them from awareness.

486
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,362
In fact, some psychologists
have even proposed

487
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:35,299
that all of us
have savant skills

488
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,868
lying dormant in our brains.

489
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,536
And they may be on to something,

490
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,738
because in extraordinarily
rare cases,

491
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:45,042
people can actually acquire
savant skills.

492
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,744
A very small number of people
have what is called

493
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:50,614
Acquired Savant Syndrome.

494
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,849
These are people who suffered
some sort of brain damage

495
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,751
as adults and their brain damage

496
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:57,587
actually unlocked skills
and abilities

497
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:59,423
that weren't there before.

498
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,858
 Jason Padgett
 is one such acquired savant.

499
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,094
 After a brain injury
 left him with damage

500
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,829
 to his visual cortex,

501
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,598
 Jason started seeing precise
 geometric patterns

502
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,067
 in everything around him,

503
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,103
 which led to an intuitive
 perception of math

504
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:15,672
 and physics
 that he never had before.

505
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:17,541
How did you get
a brain injury?

506
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,543
So I was at a karaoke bar,
and as we left,

507
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,378
these two guys
that were in there singing

508
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,713
attacked me from behind.

509
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,715
They smashed me
in the back of the head.

510
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,982
Well, I just heard
this deep thud,

511
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,117
saw a little
puff of white light,

512
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:28,752
which I later found out
was my brain

513
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:30,387
bouncing on the inside
of my skull.

514
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,456
I didn't know where I was,
how I got there,

515
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,790
why I was being attacked.

516
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,959
[Michael] So now you
have Akinetopsia,

517
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,996
meaning you see
the world now in frames.

518
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:42,733
-What does that mean?
-In discreet picture frames.

519
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,768
When I say discreetly,
I mean seeing one picture

520
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,470
and another picture.
So imagine like anybody

521
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,071
watching TV right now,
they can hit pause

522
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:49,873
and pause again and see
the picture frame

523
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,608
by frame by frame.

524
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,744
It's just like that,
but in real time.

525
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,779
It also makes everything look
slightly pixelated.

526
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,448
So boundaries of objects
don't look curved

527
00:21:58,449 --> 00:21:59,783
like smooth curves anymore.

528
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:00,984
They look like
they have these tiny

529
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:02,586
little straight line edges.

530
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,920
Are you seeing me
that way right now?

531
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:06,456
Yes. So like,
if you're not moving,

532
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:08,825
it's more like a picture
on a picture on a picture,

533
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,494
so it's not nearly
as profound,

534
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,429
but when something moves
like this,

535
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,764
then it's much more profound.

536
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,165
So after the injury,

537
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,701
you have all these
perceptual changes.

538
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:20,804
What makes you decide
that you need
to start drawing?

539
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:23,573
So at the time,
I had no way to describe

540
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:25,709
what I was seeing
in any terms

541
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,110
except for to draw it.

542
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:28,779
I started trying
to define things

543
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,947
with triangles
and straight lines.

544
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:34,684
Geometry is-- to me
is the one thing everything has,

545
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:37,521
even nothing.
Empty space is geometry.

546
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,722
It just seemed obvious.

547
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:40,957
I mean, the universe
is math for me.

548
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,527
 [Michael] Are these
 thoughts that you would've
 had before the injury?

549
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,829
No, not at all.
Never even contemplated

550
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,865
this type of stuff and now
I can't stop thinking about it

551
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:50,167
and I wound up going
to the mall.

552
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,635
So I'm sitting there
eating this sandwich

553
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,170
and I'm drawing,
and this guy next to me,

554
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,871
he says he's a physicist.
And he goes,

555
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,840
"It looks like you're doing
some sort of math there."

556
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:58,842
And I started telling him,
you know, my ideas.

557
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:01,111
And he says "It sounds to me
like you're trying to describe

558
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:03,447
space, time, and limits."

559
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,115
And things that
I didn't understand
what he was talking about.

560
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:06,850
He goes, "But you're doing it
in layman terms

561
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,919
"and I've never heard anybody
try to do that before."

562
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,220
It turns out
it was integrals.

563
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,456
What I was doing
was integrals and calculus.

564
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,691
You're now pursuing
an education in math?

565
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:16,893
-[Jason] Yes.
-So would you say that

566
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:20,464
you're still the same person

567
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,098
who existed
before the injury,

568
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:24,935
or did you become
a different individual?

569
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,137
I feel like I've
had two different lives.

570
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,573
Before the injury, I didn't have
any background in math.

571
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,974
I didn't even have algebra.

572
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:32,943
I didn't even know
that you could graph a line.

573
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,846
All I did was party
and chase girls.

574
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,814
It was a very shallow,
you know,

575
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:40,050
almost blissfully
ignorant life.

576
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,786
Do you think
that these abilities

577
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:44,488
were always in your brain

578
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,923
and got somehow
unlocked by the injury,

579
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:49,826
or did the injury
give you something new?

580
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:53,129
I 100% believe that
we all have this in us.

581
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,031
You know, people think
that I got hit in the head

582
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:56,867
and just magically
got good at math

583
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,902
but a lot of it
is your brain gets damaged

584
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:01,538
and you're forced to see
the world differently,

585
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:02,806
and by seeing the world
differently,

586
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,541
it makes you think
differently.

587
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,843
[Michael] We can learn
so much from divergent minds,

588
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:08,578
 whether it would be someone
 like Jason

589
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,046
 who developed
 his divergent mind

590
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:11,515
 from an accident
 as an adult...

591
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,149
Hello, Ashleigh.

592
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,551
[Ashleigh] Hello, Derek.

593
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:15,852
[Derek] How are you?

594
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:17,153
[Michael]
 ...or someone like Derek,

595
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:18,555
 whose divergence came

596
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:20,090
 from complications
 at birth.

597
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,825
[Adam] One of Derek's
great strengths is working

598
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,860
with other disabled people
and disabled children.

599
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:29,266
They love him.

600
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,835
Beautiful, Ashleigh.
Well done.

601
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:33,737
Derek is a hero,

602
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,939
particularly amongst
the learning disabled.

603
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,642
For anyone with severe
learning difficulties,

604
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,243
to have a public life,

605
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:41,878
to travel
all over the world,

606
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,547
to meet hundreds of people,

607
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,882
to have acclaim
from millions of people

608
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:47,217
on the internet is--

609
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:49,052
he's unique
in that perspective.

610
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:52,222
He's a trailblazer,
but we should never forget

611
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,758
that he's part of a population
that's much bigger

612
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,727
and tends to be hidden away
from society.

613
00:24:57,728 --> 00:25:05,135
[upbeat music playing]

614
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,170
Derek raises
important questions

615
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:09,272
about the diversity of minds.

616
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:12,042
Autistic minds
like all divergent minds

617
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,277
are not alien;
they're human minds

618
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:17,581
and they provide windows
into how we all think,

619
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,616
feel, and behave.

620
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:22,152
A complete brain science
should be able to account

621
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:25,055
for all kinds
of minds and brains.

622
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,891
As long as some minds
remain a mystery,

623
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:30,860
so too will all minds.

624
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:36,366
And as always,
thanks for watching.
