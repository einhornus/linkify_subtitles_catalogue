Hello Vsauce. Michael here,
and I've got a dozen DONGs for you today.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,578
These are things you can do online now,
guys. In the

3
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:11,859
"I of It" you play not as a super action
hero, but rather

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,189
as the actual letter 'I.'
You elongate and

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,778
shrink yourself to grab onto ledges and
awkwardly locomote. If you want more

6
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:20,389
letters,

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,089
upgrade your life to the Roman numeral
calculator. For instance,

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,479
191 times

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,238
7 is 1337. If you brain isn't
challenged, take these quizzes

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,839
suggested by "MadebyNotch."
You listen to classic songs from

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,199
NES or SNES games and with the help of
hints prove your worth

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,169
by identifying them. If tragedy is more
your style, go with "Zombies Took My

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,839
Daughter,"

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,509
an emotional action game where you have very
little time to find your lost kin

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,339
and plenty of zombies to hide from or blow-up.

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,839
Too many graphics?
Go textile

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,909
with "EauDeParkour's" 'YouFindYourselfInARoom.' Here

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,109
you have to type your next move.
What's neat is that the computer receiving your

19
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,429
inputs eventually gets frustrated with you

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,909
and things get pretty twisted.
Twist around shapes with Jasmine's mind warping

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,739
suggestion.

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,479
You use six different keys to rotate
pieces to fit snugly

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,579
in all kinds of new ways.
And if you're forever alone,

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,159
enjoy the company of Myself, where you solve
puzzles by doing one thing

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,079
and then restarting, using the ghost of your
former attempt as a tool.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,089
Now as a bonus, yourself and your ghosts
have different abilities

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,339
and it gets pretty satisfying. If you
still don't know how to upside down text,

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,109
do like "Nix4222"

29
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,539
and get to ToolsGeek. They'll flip text
that you can copy and paste

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,439
anywhere. I've seen a lot of creative
uses of annotation,

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,579
but "wtfdany" made one where you can beat him

32
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,779
up.
Just click and boom! Instant results.

33
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,969
Do you like a YouTube video and wish
you could loop it?

34
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,189
Well, "Griever179" showed me that you
can delete 'tube,'

35
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,159
replace it with 'repeat' and be sent to
a site that plays the video

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,249
over and over and over again forever.
Control YouTube even more

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,369
with the Video Time Machine.
This site's curatorss

38
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,849
verify dates and organize videos. So, say
if I wanted to watch television and

39
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,849
commercials from

40
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,479
the year I was born.
Ta-da! A huge list of

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,939
awesomeness to scroll through and
nostalgia about. For 99 cents you can get

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,379
the whole time machine as an app on your
iPhone, so it never leaves your side.

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,719
I leave you with flip books. 'BloodyRenegadeX' makes stories that will blow

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,689
your snot off.

45
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,029
But more personally, Frenzy Woods made a
super cool flip book

46
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,159
of the Vsauce outro. Check his work out,
he sent a lot of great ones.

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,019
And hey, what a perfect way to end my
reminder that...

48
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,199
As always,

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,480
thanks for watching.
