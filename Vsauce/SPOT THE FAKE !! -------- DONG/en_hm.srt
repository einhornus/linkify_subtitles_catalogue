Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
coming from Kansas for the 4th of July.

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:08,579
Why Kansas? Well, because out here you can
do anything. You can even put a firework

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,098
store

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:13,239
next to a gas station. But enough about
the real world, let's talk about DONGs,

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,659
things you can do online now guys. 
If your style is minimalist, play Nathan's

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,669
recommendation,

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,249
the Level Game. It's really simple,
but gets increasingly reliant on

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,499
you being clever. This Wesaucer
asked if there's a way to detect whether

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,509
an image has been

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,809
Photoshopped. One of my favorites is
Error Level Analysis.com

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,988
This site will automatically convert
your image to a known quality

12
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,869
and then compare. The higher the quality
the jpeg the better.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,789
Here's a picture of Bruce Willis's
daughter with a Photoshopped version on

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,459
the right.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,148
Notice all the activity around her face
and chin. Gotcha,

16
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:51,089
a fake. I've been playing a lot of iRunner
lately but for a similar

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,589
browser-based running game,

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,238
"Adamdre" says 'Kawairun.'
Jump, slide,

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,279
survive. "FraserGodfrey" pointed me to a
great site where you can choose fun

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,318
ASCII fonts and then it will turn whatever you
type into neat ASCII

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,329
art you can copy and paste into e-mails,
websites, forums, wherever.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,199
The very same site has a typing test,
which I know sounds kinda lame,

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,339
but you can practice your speed and
after the test see a heat map

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,339
of which letters you type the fastest and
which ones are your weakest.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,779
If you want some music,
check out 'Undo' from The Half Pennies.

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,769
Wait for it. Vsauce. There are some other
references to YouTubers hidden

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,228
throughout

28
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,909
and if you have time, try to find them all.

29
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,389
If you're sick of flat music videos,
"MegaUltranerd" told me about

30
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,939
this music video, where you can use your
cursor to click and drag your

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,079
perspective around

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,799
to see other parts of the scene.
But now let's get psychic with

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,349
"Linkfirexs." 'Akinator' is classic,
but he still blows my mind.

34
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,549
Think of a character and
actor, singer, scientist, cartoon

35
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,259
superhero,

36
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,599
whoever.
Answer his simple questions and watch his

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,149
eerie brilliance shine through.
If you never leave the house, you might like

38
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,469
Bars of black-and-white,

39
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,029
an awesome point-and-click about a sad
guy who receives a barcode scanner

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,249
that can scan some things you wouldn't expect.
Or

41
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,099
stay indoors and inside your games with
'Candy Catch,'

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,909
a neat little webcam-based game where you navigate
your body through reversed and flipped

43
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,829
images to grab the candy and not

44
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,789
the dangerous pumpkins. Alright, that
does it for games, but on Saturday I went

45
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,169
down to Joplin, Missouri

46
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,359
to help out.
It's been more than a month since the tornado hit

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,208
and this is how things look now.
The preciseness of the storm

48
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,879
is so chilling. On one side of the street
houses are together

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,399
and on the other they're not.
But of course, there are DONGs you can do about

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,879
it.

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,609
You can donate and you can also learn
about tornadoes and tornado safety.

52
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,129
Stay safe this 4th of July.

53
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,049
And as always,

54
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,550
thanks for watching.
