1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,973
We live in a universe

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:11,710
where, statistically,
disorder is king.

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,980
As time moves forward,
things fall apart.

4
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:19,151
Stars burn out.
Energy spreads out.

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,021
Entropy conquers all.

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,824
But humans, life, fights
that trend.

7
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,126
We build things.

8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,660
We organise things.

9
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,430
We add information.

10
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:41,940
So why is it that we love
destroying things?

11
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,611
Exploding fireworks.

12
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,814
Fights and crashes.

13
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,050
Even popping bubble wrap.

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,785
Ugh!

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,287
Tiny, cute things can make us

16
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,322
want to just squeeze 'em to death.

17
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:01,093
Ugh!

18
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:17,376
Why?

19
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:21,246
The power to destroy is a delicious one.

20
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,881
Even just holding this here,

21
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,950
knowing I can drop it.

22
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,585
I am in control.

23
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:31,957
I can exert my will in a
dramatic and irreversible way.

24
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,225
Ready?

25
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:40,265
Ready.

26
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,834
Ugh.

27
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,203
Beautiful.

28
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,238
Why does that feel so good to do

29
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,440
or even just watch?

30
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:53,145
For me, throwing it to its death
was almost relaxing.

31
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,415
Like, I feel calmer now
after being destructive.

32
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,551
Like I've vented some pent-up energy.

33
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,653
Or anger?

34
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:06,291
Why do we like
breaking things when we're angry?

35
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,727
There's a growing trend
of businesses called

36
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,663
anger rooms
that are popping up in places

37
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,433
like Texas and Toronto.

38
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,869
People pay to visit these anger rooms

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,407
and let off steam by smashing
mock-ups of workplaces,

40
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:26,412
kitchens and more.

41
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,983
Catharsis Theory proposes
that such acts of destruction

42
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,118
reduce our anger.

43
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,620
But do they?

44
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,690
Sometimes,
but sometimes they don't.

45
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,659
This is what makes studying
the mind so difficult.

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,595
Researchers are still looking
into the specifics

47
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,933
and the variables involved,
and I want to see first-hand

48
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,470
and in person what it's like
when people get angry

49
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,005
and then break things.

50
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:59,778
Will they be more or less
violent afterwards?

51
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,580
To demonstrate
Catharsis Theory

52
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,682
we set up our own anger room

53
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,453
to see whether or not breaking
things will help calm down

54
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,921
some angry people.

55
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,856
Our subjects think
they're participating

56
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,559
in a study about opposing
political views

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,961
so we've asked them
to write an essay

58
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:20,165
on different polarising topics.

59
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,300
- Come in.
- Kashona? Hi.

60
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,835
How are you?
I'm Michael.

61
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,203
Hi, Michael.

62
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,304
It's nice to meet you.

63
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,374
I was just with your
co-participant Clint.

64
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,775
He's in another room.

65
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,444
I'm gonna give your essay
to Clint

66
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,912
and he's gonna critique it

67
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,548
and you're going
to critique his.

68
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,617
- Okay, thank you.
- See you soon.

69
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,286
He wrote a lot.
I didn't write that much.

70
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,821
Okay.

71
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,989
Each of our subjects

72
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,625
has been paired with a man
named Clint

73
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,161
and they will be critiquing
each other's essays.

74
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,997
"Police officers have
a very difficult job.

75
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:57,403
They have to protect us mainly
from people of colour."

76
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,604
The thing is...

77
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,005
Okay, here we go.

78
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,473
I'm actually Clint.

79
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:06,378
Overblown, un-American.
Get over it.

80
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,314
My job...
or rather, Clint's job...

81
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,849
is to make our subjects mad

82
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,719
so they can test
our anger room.

83
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,722
[BLEEP]

84
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:21,260
"You should be ashamed."

85
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,295
"You deserve what's coming to you."

86
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:31,036
What an asshole.

87
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,339
Ha!
Changed it to black.

88
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,443
That's better.

89
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,579
Oops!

90
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,082
Okay, Kashona, I'm back.

91
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,484
And you were with Clint.
Okay.

92
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,820
Let's go through what he wrote just quickly.

93
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,854
He wrote...

94
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,557
- Did I put that that way?
- No, you didn't.

95
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,892
- Did you turn it around?
- I did turn it around.

96
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,994
He seems like a bigot
or somebody.

97
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,063
I didn't want to
keep looking at his face.

98
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:03,002
He's responded to your essay there.

99
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,337
We can't tell people where
to go to eat for lunch,

100
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,205
what car to drive,

101
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,973
that just really irritates me.

102
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,177
This is a person that is making arguments

103
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,246
that are not based in any fact.

104
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,814
He's clearly someone who thinks

105
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:20,452
that the people
who are on social programmes are lazy.

106
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:25,391
I was like,
"What the [BLEEP]?"

107
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,293
Getting fired up, mother...
ooh, I'm getting fired up.

108
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,795
It's disgusting.

109
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,397
I got an F-plus?

110
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,699
Oh, I hope I don't see him
in the hallway.

111
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,967
He's a dick.

112
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,102
And that is why, he is part
of the reason

113
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,906
why our country [BLEEP] sucks
right now.

114
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,708
Because he's stupid.

115
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,678
Well, I think that was pretty effective.

116
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,881
We've got a lot of angry people
on our hands,

117
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,917
so will demolishing things calm them down,

118
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,622
or will acts of destruction
throw fuel on the fire?

119
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,757
Let's explore Catharsis Theory

120
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,958
with an expert.

121
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,827
The modern view of catharsis

122
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,263
is that by acting out

123
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,465
we release sort of like
a pressure valve,

124
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,500
and that releases that energy

125
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,502
in order for us to sort of build up again

126
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,672
and handle everyday distress.

127
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,575
People who are angry and aggressive

128
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,545
who then act that out, what
would they feel afterwards?

129
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,447
What many studies have found

130
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,482
is that it's a short-lived release

131
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,818
it feels good,
it feels really good to release...

132
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,386
but what happens in the brain is

133
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,021
the brain enjoys that.

134
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,623
There's really a reward to
build up that pressure again

135
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,059
and then release it again.

136
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,662
It's a temporary fix, as far as we know.

137
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:40,099
I didn't realise it was so complicated

138
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,900
and still being researched.

139
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,136
I thought it was black and white.

140
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,205
You do this, and you release the emotion

141
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,206
and it's gone.

142
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,907
Yes, not as much.

143
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,642
We don't have this
perfect definition

144
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,378
of catharsis,
where everybody agrees,

145
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,014
here's how it works,
here's how it ends up.

146
00:06:55,015 --> 00:07:00,853
Well, let's see if catharsis
works for us.

147
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,822
Now that Clint has sufficiently
angered all of our subjects...

148
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,859
He's more like a [BLEEP]
pussy, as far as I'm concerned.

149
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,431
It's time to put
Catharsis Theory to the test.

150
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,866
Some subjects will be allowed

151
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,168
to actively take out their anger

152
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,671
on all of these beautiful art objects.

153
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,074
You have completely free reign

154
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,843
to break anything in this room.

155
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,011
- What?
- Okay?

156
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,880
Other subjects are instructed

157
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,182
to sit in the room passively.

158
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,917
I want you to reflect on

159
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,820
the essay, the arguments,

160
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,288
the critiques

161
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,592
and also on the objects in this room.

162
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,227
Am I going to meet Clint, or no?

163
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,395
- No, you are not.
- Okay.

164
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,863
That's not part of this study.

165
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,998
Okay, gotcha.

166
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,000
Will these subjects feel less angry

167
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,836
after their violent acts of destruction?

168
00:07:50,837 --> 00:08:13,258
Only one way to find out.

169
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,928
When we are angry,
the body's adrenal glands

170
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,696
release cortisol and adrenaline,

171
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:26,171
readying the body and mind for fight mode.

172
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,741
But Catharsis Theory hypothesises

173
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:45,624
that letting it out relieves
feelings of aggression.

174
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,094
Will these subjects feel less
angry after their violent acts

175
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,930
of destruction?

176
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,799
Okay, I'm done.

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,801
Before we move on to the final step

178
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,936
of our anger-room demonstration,

179
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,172
maybe we can gain insight
from someone who makes

180
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,274
a living by hitting.

181
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,778
Not objects, but other people.

182
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,180
Mark Smith, aka "Rhino",

183
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:12,651
is a champion bodybuilder, boxer
and UK gladiator

184
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,119
who knows a thing or two

185
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,024
about how to destroy an opponent.

186
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,993
So, when you're going into a fight

187
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,928
you know that you're going to get hurt.

188
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,563
- Yes.
- You know that you're gonna

189
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,464
hurt someone else.

190
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,965
How do you psych yourself up

191
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,934
to be good at that?

192
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,436
When you're goin' into a fight

193
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,104
you want to stick to your game plan,

194
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,074
stay focused and be relaxed.

195
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,008
Relaxed...

196
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,343
Because I would have thought

197
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,677
you'd want to go in angry.

198
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,312
No, because if you go in too angry

199
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,814
all you're doing is...

200
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,382
and you're not thinking straight

201
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,584
it turns into, like, a school brawl.

202
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,353
- It's a very tactical game.
- Right.

203
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,355
The eye of the tiger,
like Rocky.

204
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,223
But this is fascinating to me

205
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:55,928
because you would think that to
physically outfight someone

206
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,232
in nature, we would have evolved
to run off of anger and fear.

207
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,401
That's like two lions,
I agree with you there.

208
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,503
Two lions attack and go
full out, don't they?

209
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,472
There's no pace in that fight whatsoever,

210
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,074
like animals, but you have to
know when to be an animal

211
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,876
and at what point in the fight.

212
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,011
- Bang!
- Oh!

213
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:15,014
– So there's no point in...
– I'm a very jumpy, flinchy person.

214
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,849
It's knowing when to pull the trigger.

215
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,954
If you ever find yourself
angry in your real life,

216
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,857
do you find it helpful to punch
a punching bag...

217
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,125
- Definitely.
- Yeah?

218
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,360
I will get angry, like,
I'm on the phone

219
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,731
with my bank,
and I might think slamming a door

220
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,300
or just hanging up
and throwing my phone on the bed...

221
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,603
No, don't throw your phone,
and don't slam doors.

222
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,673
Just come and exercise and hit the bag.
You'll feel so much better.


223
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,275
What's the difference though?
They're both active things.

224
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,712
You're not doing something spontaneous
and acting on impulse.

225
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:47,946
It's premeditated.

226
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,215
You know you'll go: "Okay,
I'm gonna pack my bag,

227
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,184
go to the gym...".
You're releasing endorphins,

228
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,186
you'll feel more relaxed
and you'll be able to assess

229
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,788
the bank manager
who's been irritating you

230
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,122
for the last hour.

231
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,191
Can I... can I try hitting some things?

232
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,826
Definitely.
You can try hitting me.

233
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,960
- Can I really?
- Yes.

234
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,463
- Are you gonna hit back?
- I will...

235
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:05,998
...I'll let you know I'm there.

236
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,169
Okay.

237
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,305
Awesome.
Do I look scary?

238
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,406
Oh, yeah.

239
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,042
Is Rhino correct that
violent acts of rage

240
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,811
won't calm you down?

241
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,879
But the controlled aggression
used in boxing

242
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,383
will actually relax you?

243
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:36,528
I guess I'm about to find out.

244
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:50,843
Yes, like that.

245
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,512
No, no.

246
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:59,284
No.
Come on!

247
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm tired.

248
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,622
Well done!

249
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,257
Good work.

250
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,960
I came out of the fight
having learned two things.

251
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,795
One, I'm a wimp.

252
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,530
And two, Rhino was right;

253
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,232
when physical violence is channelled

254
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,734
in an organised sport like boxing,

255
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,303
it can actually
reduce feelings of aggression.

256
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,740
I had this weird combination of feelings.

257
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,208
- As tired as I am...
- Yep.

258
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,377
I'm very amped-up.

259
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,945
- So now you feel it.
- Yeah.

260
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,415
I don't feel aggressive.

261
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,116
You feel relaxed?

262
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,518
I wouldn't say I'm relaxed here

263
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,120
I would just say I'm clearer here

264
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,624
and I feel more in control.

265
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,325
Eye of the tiger, Rock.

266
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,996
Yeah, well,
maybe it's the eye of the kitten

267
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,597
who is in a bad mood

268
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:50,936
but, man, that was great.

269
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:55,274
It's time for the final part of
our anger-room demonstration.

270
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,142
All of our subjects
will be taking part

271
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,645
in what they think is a reflex test

272
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,147
against their opponent Clint.

273
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,383
In reality, of course,
there is no Clint

274
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,951
and what we're really looking at

275
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,420
is the Catharsis Theory.

276
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,223
Have our subjects' levels
of anger been affected

277
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,891
according to whether they committed

278
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,361
violent acts of destruction?

279
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,096
Or not?

280
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,965
Stage three is going to be testing

281
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,435
how your reflexes are working
at this very moment.

282
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,436
Okay?

283
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:28,941
So, this right here
is a static-electricity generator

284
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,276
that is going to provide
a little bit of a shock.

285
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,178
We're putting one on Clint as well

286
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,147
and he's in another room

287
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,983
but you both have the same setup.

288
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,986
Once our subjects are fitted
with the shock bracelet

289
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,289
they're introduced to
the test's control panel.

290
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,557
Look at this.

291
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,226
Yeah, it's very simplified

292
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,928
but that really helps keep
the variables low.

293
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,232
So both you and Clint will be
competing in a bit of a game.

294
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,668
The yellow light is going to
come on at some point,

295
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,337
and as soon as you see it come on,

296
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,938
hit that orange button.

297
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,208
And if you hit this button
before Clint does

298
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,910
you'll see the green light come on.

299
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:07,012
And that'll mean that you won.

300
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:12,151
And Clint needs to receive
a small shock, okay?

301
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,454
And you can set this to a level
of your choosing.

302
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,056
So... okay.

303
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,891
Light goes on, if I hit this

304
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,826
the green one comes
and then I'm allowed

305
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:21,994
to work this contraption.

306
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,495
- Correct.
- Which controls how

307
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,698
high the voltage and for how
long the voltage.

308
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,199
- Correct.
- Okay.

309
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,336
If, however, Clint pushes
the button before you do,

310
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,237
the red light will come on,
indicating...

311
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,006
My red light and I'm about to get it.

312
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,508
You'll get a shock,
yeah, correct.

313
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,345
We'll get a sense of our
subjects' level of anger

314
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,314
by how they respond to the
chance to administer pain

315
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,749
to Clint.

316
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:50,522
Remember, this subject just sat
in the anger room passively.

317
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,091
Did I get him?

318
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,492
Oh, all right.

319
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,994
The green light means our subject wins.

320
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,130
How hard will he shock Clint?

321
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,965
I'm gonna give you
a little low one, buddy.

322
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,034
There you go.

323
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:08,540
Just a kiss.

324
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,109
Ah, got me.

325
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,144
The red light means Clint won.

326
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,946
How will our subject respond

327
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,047
to getting shocked?

328
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,615
Ahh!

329
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,018
You son of a bitch.

330
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,953
Not only does this subject

331
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,756
not seem angry, he's actually
enjoying the game.

332
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,457
All right.

333
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,693
How about that?

334
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,428
I'm not gonna harm you, man.

335
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,130
I'll give ya a little low one.

336
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,998
He actually seems
relatively calm.

337
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:41,306
Will our other passive subject
follow suit?

338
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,976
Clint gave her a painful shock.

339
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:52,785
Let's see how strongly she retaliates.

340
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,787
Even after getting a shock from Clint,

341
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,722
this subject is still hesitant

342
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:59,258
to give him a shock in return.

343
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,126
Okay, Clint and Drea,

344
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,229
this is just a reminder that you are...

345
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,732
...you are allowed to change that dial

346
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,500
to what you think would be appropriate.

347
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,903
Yeah, I just don't want to,
like, hurt him or anything.

348
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,638
I'm just gonna keep it at low.

349
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,540
So the angry subjects who sat passively

350
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,076
seem to have calmed down.

351
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,845
Now it's time to check on the
subjects who acted violently

352
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,413
in the anger room.

353
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,316
Did letting out all of that aggression

354
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,318
relieve their anger?

355
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:40,566
The experiment will begin now.

356
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,800
Take it, take it, take it!

357
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,235
Kashona.

358
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,070
That's... that's fine.

359
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,672
What level is your dial at?

360
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:51,844
Um...

361
00:16:51,845 --> 00:17:05,723
Low.

362
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,291
He cranked that all the way up

363
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,627
and he's laying on that button.

364
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,397
This subject was one of
the most aggressive people

365
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,333
in the anger room,

366
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:27,780
but that doesn't seem to have
calmed him down.

367
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,615
Among our subjects

368
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,517
it seems that those
who physically vented

369
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,619
their anger are still pretty angry

370
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,191
compared to the subjects who sat quietly.

371
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,460
So at least in this case

372
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,697
catharsis therapy was not effective.

373
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,765
In fact, in some cases

374
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,535
the subject seems even angrier.

375
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,203
Ow! [BLEEP]

376
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,138
You know what?
That's too hard.

377
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,873
You [BLEEP] dick...!

378
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:58,777
Why don't you come in here and
[BLEEP] talk to me in person?

379
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,380
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

380
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,183
We're all familiar with
the concept of rubbernecking.

381
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,452
It's hard to look away from a car crash.

382
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,821
Oh, my God.

383
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,622
But why?

384
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,825
There are surely a myriad of reasons,

385
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:15,661
but one may be that at a primitive level

386
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:20,399
witnessing danger allows us
to learn and prepare for it.

387
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,902
Activities where danger
and destruction are likely

388
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,137
are exciting.

389
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,839
Starting in our childhood,

390
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,208
physical aggression is encouraged,

391
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,476
even in games.

392
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,544
Take a piñata for example.

393
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,380
As a special birthday treat

394
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:38,517
we are told to beat up
an effigy with a baseball bat.

395
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,319
And when we hit it hard enough

396
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,889
we are rewarded with candy.

397
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,360
What parts of a child's urge
to destroy are innate

398
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,728
versus learned?

399
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,930
Well,
there is a groundbreaking experiment

400
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,599
that shed light on this.

401
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,569
In 1961, Albert Bandura conducted a famous

402
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,908
and controversial study
called the Bobo Doll Experiment.

403
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,612
He had adults act violently
to an inflatable clown doll

404
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,480
in the presence of children.

405
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,684
Then left the children alone
with the same doll

406
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,253
to see if they would mimic
the destructive behavior

407
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,921
they'd observed.

408
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:19,925
Disturbingly, the children
did indeed copy the adults,

409
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,860
and lashed out at the doll,

410
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,730
often getting very creative
with their aggression

411
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,533
and destruction.

412
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,903
Aggression comes in many
unexpected forms.

413
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:35,341
Why is it so hard to resist
popping bubbles in bubble wrap,

414
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,575
for instance?

415
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,410
Do we like the sound?

416
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,280
The destruction?
Or both?

417
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,749
It's like we're naturally drawn
to destroying

418
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,752
these harmless plastic bubbles of air.

419
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:50,022
Destructive tendencies
seem to be so engrained in us

420
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,258
that we even respond
to positive stimulation

421
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,327
with urges to destroy.

422
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,297
One of the strangest things
about destruction

423
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,800
is how people want to hug things to death,

424
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,837
especially things that are extremely cute

425
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,405
like a puppy.

426
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,307
We don't know exactly why this is

427
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,976
but there is a study
that demonstrates the effect

428
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:17,316
by using bubble wrap
and our desire to pop these bubbles.

429
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:24,356
Oh, yeah.

430
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:28,961
Can sweet, adorable stimuli
really incite aggressive behavior?

431
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,195
We're about to find out.

432
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,731
Thank you for participating
in our focus test.

433
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,532
No problem.

434
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,401
Please make yourself comfortable.

435
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,036
We've recruited subjects
who think

436
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,838
they're taking part
in a motor-skills test.

437
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,640
Are you familiar with
this product?

438
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,308
- Yes.
- Have you popped the bubbles

439
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,677
in bubble wrap before?

440
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:45,778
Yes.

441
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,713
But really, what we're testing

442
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,783
is their aggressive response
to cute stimuli.

443
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,318
So you will be viewing
a montage of images.

444
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,120
Please pop bubbles
in the bubble wrap.

445
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,990
You may pop
as many or as few as you like.

446
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,392
Just be sure to start
when the images begin

447
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,094
and stop when the images end.

448
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,531
Popping bubbles is like
squeezing a stress ball.

449
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,400
It's a great way to express aggression.

450
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,004
The question is, will
the subjects pop more bubbles

451
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:18,110
when watching
neutral images, or cute ones?

452
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,747
First we showed our subjects
these basic landscapes,

453
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:29,455
which are not designed to
elicit an emotional response.

454
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:56,015
And we tallied
the total number of bubbles popped.

455
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:59,718
Okay, great.
I'll take those.

456
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,487
All right,
we're gonna do part two

457
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,523
where you'll be viewing
another set of images.

458
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,692
We also showed them
images of...

459
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:13,565
... puppies.

460
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,102
Oh, look at that one!

461
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,672
Don't you just want to
hug them and squeeze them...

462
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:23,942
okay, look, you get the point.

463
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,477
To keep things even,

464
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,080
half of the subjects viewed
the landscapes first

465
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,582
and half viewed the puppies first.

466
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,452
But either way, they seemed
to pop a lot more bubbles

467
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,854
while watching the puppies.

468
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:42,995
Except for this guy.

469
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:45,130
So-called cute aggression

470
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:49,668
is a universal
psychological phenomenon.

471
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:52,037
Researchers believe the brain's response

472
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,440
to both cuteness and aggression

473
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,742
results in the release of dopamine

474
00:22:56,743 --> 00:23:00,179
implicated in reward and pleasure

475
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,948
If we are unable to
physically touch cute stimuli,

476
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,718
the desire to do so can be regulated

477
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:09,588
by substituting aggressive
physical behavior.

478
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:19,498
Will our results reflect this theory?

479
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,734
How did you feel
about the images that you saw?

480
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,135
They were cool.

481
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,070
How did you feel about the puppies?

482
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,205
I love them.

483
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:30,042
They were very tiny and adorable
and I wanted to hug them.

484
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:32,678
And how did you feel about
popping the bubble wrap?

485
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,081
I felt like I wanted to

486
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,517
play with the dogs, or...

487
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:41,687
I wanted to play with the bubble
wrap with the dogs.

488
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:44,289
In our simple test, our
subjects popped an average

489
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,727
of 33% more bubbles while
watching cute puppies

490
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:51,563
as opposed to boring landscapes.

491
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,932
So was the bubble wrap
a stand-in for the puppies?

492
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,501
I guess so.

493
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:57,302
In fact, the majority of our subjects

494
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,872
popped more bubbles
while watching puppies.

495
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,741
But not this guy.
Remember him?

496
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,144
So how did you feel about
seeing the dog pictures?

497
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:08,080
I've always been more
of a cat person.

498
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,082
It seems sometimes cuteness

499
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:18,924
is a matter of perspective.

500
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:23,028
Our relationship with
destruction is not a simple one.

501
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:28,000
It can release endorphins
and relax our minds.

502
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:32,938
It can amp us up
and make us even more aggressive.

503
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:36,241
It can even help us regulate
our emotional reactions

504
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,244
to cute things.

505
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,647
Destruction can be useful,

506
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,749
it can be dangerous

507
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:51,857
and it can be a lot of fun.

508
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:54,394
And as always,
thanks for watching.
