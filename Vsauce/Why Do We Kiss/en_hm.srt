00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,649
Hey, Vsauce, Michael here.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:12,369
Attachment of two people's lips kissing. 
The average person will spend about 20,160 minutes

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:19,198
of his or her life kissing. And the world
record for the longest, continuous kiss is

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,759
58 hours 35 minutes and 58 seconds.
But why do we kiss?

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,879
I mean, if you think about it, it seems kind
of weird...right? I mean, sure, today kissing

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:39,819
represents peace, respect, passion, love.
But when the first two people in human history

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:48,018
kissed, were they just kind of being gross?
Well, let's begin with what we do know: kissing

8
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:50,538
feels good and it's good for you.

9
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:57,939
A passionate kiss burns about 2-3 calories
per minute, and releases epinephryn and norepinephryn

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,768
into the blood, making your heart pump faster.
Kissing more often is correlated with a

11
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:09,919
reduction of bad cholesteral and perceived
stress. But these positive effects didn't

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,499
become widespread by accident. Why did brains
and bodies that love kissing become so common?

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:24,408
Well, a popular story holds it that Pacman's
shape was inspired by the shape of a pizza

14
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:30,269
with a slice missing. But Toru Iwatani, the
creator of Pacman, admitted that this was

15
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,739
only half-true. Pacman's shape was also inspired
by rounding out the shape of the Japanese

16
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:43,078
character for "mouth." And it's mouths and
Pacman's favorite activity, eating, which

17
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,569
together bring us closer to the heart of the kiss.

18
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,438
Evolutionary psychologists have argued that
what we know today as "kissing" may have come

19
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:01,408
from "kiss-feeding," the exchange of pre-chewed
food from one mouth to another. Mother birds

20
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,569
are famous for doing this, and many primates
are frequently seen doing it as well. Not

21
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,719
that long ago, it was common between human
mothers and their children. In fact, before

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:18,599
commercially produced or DIY baby-food instructions
were readily available, it made a lot of sense.

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,169
Recently, Alicia Silverstone uploaded a clip
of herself mouth feeding her child. It seemed

24
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,469
strange to some people, but even though, yeah,
it exchanges saliva, which, like any contact

25
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,919
with an infant, can transfer pathogens, healthy
mothers and healthy children can benefit from

26
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,839
the fact that kiss feeding provides nutrients.
Carbohydrates, proteins, iron and zinc, which

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,539
are not always available in breast milk. 
Plus, an adult saliva can help pre-digest the food,

28
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,579
making vitamins like B-12 easier for the baby to absorb.

29
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:01,629
So, mouth-to-mouth attachment has a history
of intimacy, trust and closeness. Your saliva

30
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,629
also carries information about who you are,
your level of health, and mucus membranes

31
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:15,029
in our mouths are permeable to hormones like
testosterone, making a kiss a way to taste-test

32
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:23,359
a potential mate. A good kiss can be biological
evidence that your kisser might be a good mate.

33
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,869
So, as a strategy for mate selection, pre-historic
people who enjoyed kissing, and did it more

34
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,749
often, may have made better decisions, picked
better mates, reproduced more successfully,

35
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:44,579
and, eventually, become the norm. Giving us...us,
people who love kissing.

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,939
Any infant could have seen those benefits
coming from a mile away, even though an infant's

37
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,159
vision isn't that great. From birth to four
months, babies can only focus on things about

38
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,019
8-10 inches away from their face which, not
surpisingly, is about the distance to their

39
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,569
mother's face while breast feeding.

40
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:11,329
So, faces, especially those looking right
at us, tend to be the very first things in

41
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:19,369
our lives we can focus on and see clearly.
This might explain why we are so good at detecting

42
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,869
faces. Humans are off the charts when it comes
to this, in fact, we tend to see faces even

43
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,559
when there aren't any.
It's called "pareidolia."

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,609
Because humans are so cooperative, it makes
sense for us to be good at recognizing faces.

45
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,739
And, more importantly, detecting when someone
is looking directly at us and clearly expressing

46
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,359
when we are looking at someone else.

47
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,549
A predator who lives by not being seen needs
a gaze that's less obvious. In fact, research

48
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,769
has shown that our surprisingly white scleras,
the area that borders the iris, isn't just

49
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,199
an accident, but is a vital piece of human
eye morphology that makes it easier for us

50
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,959
to ascertain the direction of someone else's
gaze at a glance.

51
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,579
We also have impressive gaze-direction networks
inside our brains, containing individual neurons

52
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,489
that fire when someone is staring directly
at us, but that stop firing if the gaze shifts

53
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,399
just a degree or two.

54
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,508
So, yeah, you can tell when you're being watched.
We humans are quite sensitive to it, even

55
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:39,948
those of us with "Scopophobia," the fear of
being stared at. But to be sure, in order

56
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:46,418
for this to work, the other person's gaze
must be within your line of sight, your field

57
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:53,049
of vision, that is, you can see them. 
Otherwise, if the stare is coming, say, from behind,

58
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,119
there is no evidence that people can tell
they are being watched.

59
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,269
The "Psychic Staring Effect" falls within
the realm of pseudo-science. No widely-accepted

60
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,899
studies have ever found evidence that it exists.
Anecdotally, what's more likely is that the

61
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:18,688
very act of rubber-necking to see who's watching
causes people to look up, and for your gazes

62
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:19,948
to attach.

63
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:26,948
But what about attachment when no one is
watching? One explanation for an infant's

64
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:34,619
love, attachment to their mother, doesn't
involve vision or staring, but, instead, food.

65
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,799
The idea is that we love our mothers because
as soon as we are born, they are a source

66
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,839
of life-sustaining nourishment. But what
if that nourishment came not from a loving

67
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,408
mother, but from a scary "Wire Mother"?

68
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:57,788
In the 1950's, Harry Harlow conducted a series
of famous, but controversial, experiments

69
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:04,369
on monkeys at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison. Harlow's findings had substantial

70
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,728
implications on our understanding of attachment.
But by today's standards, his work would

71
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:17,468
largely be considered unethical. In one of
his most famous experiments, Harlow separated

72
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:22,478
young monkeys from their mothers as soon as
they were born and stuck them in cages with

73
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:29,899
two fake mothers: a soft one wrapped in cloth
that did nothing, and a cold, mechanical mother

74
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:37,429
made of wire that, nonetheless, did provide
food. But despite being a cupboard mother,

75
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,579
the young baby monkey's didn't bond with her.
When Harlow and his team scared the baby monkeys

76
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:51,299
with a strange contraption, the monkeys ran
and clinged not to their wire source of life-sustaining

77
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:58,329
nourishment, but to the soft, cuddly and
otherwise useless cloth-mother.

78
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,098
This suggested that warmth and comfort was
more important than food when it came to nurturing

79
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:12,049
attachment. Harlow also built a rejecting
mother, which used a blast of pressurized air

80
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:19,528
to push baby monkeys away. But instead of
finding another source of comfort, these monkeys

81
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:25,609
clung even tighter at all times than monkeys
raised without rejecting mothers. And this

82
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,228
is what blows my mind. The instinct for warmth
and comfort in newborn creatures is so strong

83
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:40,779
it not only resists attempts to frustrate
it, but is paradoxically strengthened by it.

84
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,539
Eckhard Hess tested this by using electric
shocks to discourage ducklings from following

85
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,469
the object they were imprinted on. But it
only strengthened the behavior and made them

86
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:59,129
follow more closely than ever before. The
fact that a "wire mother," or a rejecting

87
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:06,689
mother, or receiving electric shocks for attaching
to your mother, would cause more attachment,

88
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:14,239
more love, more dependence, seems like a paradox.
But paradoxes can teach us. As Oscar Wilde

89
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,059
put it, "a paradox is the truth standing on
its head to attract attention."

90
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,249
And what gets our attention here is the effect
uncertainty can have.

91
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:32,249
In 1955 A.E. Fisher conducted an experiment
on puppies. His team separated puppies into

92
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,599
three groups. Members of the first group were
treated kindly every time they approached

93
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,619
a researcher. Members of the second group
were punished for approaching the researchers.

94
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,029
And puppies in the third group were randomly
treated kindly or punished. They grew up

95
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:56,139
never knowing what to expect. Their world
was not a world of kindness or punishment,

96
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,289
but rather one of uncertainty.

97
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:06,019
What's really chilling is that the study found
that that group, the third group of puppies,

98
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:13,529
wound up being the most attached to the researchers.
The third group loved the researchers the

99
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:20,509
strongest and was the most dependent upon
them. Guy Murchie called this the "Polarity

100
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:26,449
Principle": "stress, including the mental
stress of uncertainty, is an ingredient in

101
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:34,549
attachment or love and perhaps even manifestations
of hatred (its polar opposite) somehow enhance

102
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,739
love."

103
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,829
Uncertainty, psychologically, can lead to
some of the greatest feelings of attachment

104
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:49,909
and dependence. Good things, and bad things,
in our lives often seem random and out of

105
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,999
our control. So, it's no surprise that we
often react with blind love and acceptance

106
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,989
in the face of an unfair existence because,
what else are we supposed to do? We are that

107
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,529
third group of puppies.

108
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:11,529
But investigating uncertainty, conquering
it, so as to make the best decisions possible

109
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:20,529
is advantageous. So, over time, life has favored
activities that turn uncertainty into knowledge.

110
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,989
Not every person out there is the best mate
for you, but if it didn't matter which one

111
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,529
you picked, a kiss, a taste-test, wouldn't
be necessary, and it wouldn't need to feel

112
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,189
so good or bring us so much pleasure.

113
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,049
So, go out there and kiss someone today.

114
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:50,319
And as always, thanks for watching.

115
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,319
By the way, tomorrow I am headed to the European
Space Agency's Space Port in South America

116
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,729
with Euronews to watch a rocket launch in
real life. Do you have any questions about

117
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,639
space or space travel today? Let me know in
the comments below and I will ask the experts

118
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,320
your questions.
