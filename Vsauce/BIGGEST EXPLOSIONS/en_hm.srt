00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
and today I'm in my apartment.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:14,659
But when I was in Kansas with family
my dad lit off what is known as a quarter stick.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,379
But don't worry, absolutely no children were around.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,041
Okay, look, the point is that today we're going to talk about explosives.

5
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:26,068
Let's begin way down the scale with black powder,

6
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,841
or smokeless powder which many modern rounds use.

7
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:31,767
Now, usually smokeless powder doesn't even detonate.

8
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:34,307
Instead, it deflagrates.

9
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:36,938
Technically, an explosion is only a detonation

10
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:41,438
when the material or the gases expelled travel faster than the speed of sound.

11
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,202
If the explosion is subsonic,
you're only dealing with a deflagration.

12
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:50,402
Now, we want a bullet's propellant
to deflagrate, not detonate,

13
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:53,608
because we want it to have enough power
to move the bullet quickly,

14
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,628
but not release its energy so fast
as to damage the gun or ourselves.

15
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,734
Take a look at some smokeless powder
lit in the open and slow motion.

16
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:03,459
It burns very strongly and quickly,

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,359
but at all times, the gasses it expels
never exceed the speed of sound

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,705
and no shock wave is produced. We're looking at deflegration here, not detonation.

19
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,145
To compare, this is nitroglycerin.

20
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:18,485
It's so fragile, you hit it with a hammer and it detonates.

21
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:25,599
Even at a slower speed, we can see that all the material immediately explodes.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,807
Consumer fireworks use black powder, gun powder,

23
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:32,487
and as such, they don't have enough power to really ever be set to detonate.

24
00:01:32,488 --> 00:01:35,836
The same goes for that quarter stick
you saw my dad light off.

25
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:38,139
Those and M80s and cherry bombs

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,039
are louder and often illegal, but they burn flash powder, not a high explosive light dynamite.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,379
But that doesn't mean fireworks can't be amazing.

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,419
Currently, some of the largest
shells in use are 48 inches across.

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,259
When exploded in the air, a 48 inch shell

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:02,819
looks like this.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:10,758
Or like this.

32
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:21,659
Oh yeah, when they fail to launch and burst on the ground instead, it looks like this.

33
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,539
But let's move on to detonations—no matter what material releases the energy—

34
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,173
whether it's a conventional explosive or a nuclear bomb or an asteroid impact or an earthquake,

35
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:35,739
they are all commonly measured by saying how much TNT you would have to detonate

36
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,319
to get an equivalently strong explosion.

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,069
To give you a sense of scale,
here is the detonation of approximately 100 tons

38
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:53,699
of TNT by a defense contractor disposing of explosives.

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,999
Unlike deflegrations, detonations produce a shockwave,

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,439
which is just that, a wave made of areas of high pressure and low pressure.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,600
This explosion was so powerful
the area of low pressure

42
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:09,980
had such low pressure that water vapor in the air around it condensed momentarily,

43
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,220
which formed this cloud.

44
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:16,940
And here's a video of an explosion where the shock wave is particularly visible

45
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:27,459
as it approaches and hits the camera man.

46
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,759
You can also see shock condensation
clouds around these explosions

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,059
set off by the United States in Hawaii in 1965.

48
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,170
The US wanted to know nuclear attacks
would affect naval ships,

49
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:42,199
so they detonated an equivalent amount of TNT

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,079
on an island with US ships anchored nearby.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,459
This pile contains 500 tons

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,759
of TNT waiting to explode.

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:58,999
When it does, it looks like this.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,240
Earlier, the US tested actual nuclear weapons
to see how underwater detonations

55
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,800
might affect our ships.

56
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:09,206
This underwater nuclear explosion is much larger,

57
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,700
the equivalent of not 100 tons of TNT,

58
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:20,299
not 500 tons, but 8,000 tons.

59
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,641
For comparison, the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima

60
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:29,521
in 1945 exploded with the energy of 15,000 tons of TNT.

61
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:34,069
The single most physically powerful device
ever used by humanity

62
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,029
was the Tsar Bomb.

63
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,138
The Soviet Union tested it in 1961,

64
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,339
far up north away from civilization.

65
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,000
It was detonated two and a half miles
above the surface of the earth

66
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:49,744
to minimize its destruction, which
was unprecedented by man.

67
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:52,304
The Tsar Bomb exploded with the power equivalent

68
00:04:52,305 --> 00:05:05,240
to 50 million tons of TNT.

69
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:06,640
The mushroom cloud from the Tsar Bomb

70
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:10,583
extended beyond our normal atmosphere
into the mesosphere

71
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,976
and dwarfed the largest clouds from US detonations.

72
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,546
It was so large that comparatively

73
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:21,808
the bombs dropped on Japan, well,
they're on the graph way down there.

74
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:25,212
But at the end of the day,
nothing can beat supernovas,

75
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:28,340
the explosion of an entire star.

76
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:33,080
While 50 million tons may sound like a lot,
one supernova is estimated

77
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:40,459
to give off the energy equivalent
of ten octillion million tons of TNT.

78
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,402
I leave you with a cannon developed by
the US to shoot a normal little cannon ball,

79
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:49,059
except that it carried a nuclear warhead.

80
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,219
I'm pretty sure you can pick these up at
Bass Pro Shop, but regardless,

81
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,059
be sure you're subscribed to Vsauce

82
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,539
so you don't miss anything coming up,

83
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,979
And as always,

84
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,420
thanks for watching.
