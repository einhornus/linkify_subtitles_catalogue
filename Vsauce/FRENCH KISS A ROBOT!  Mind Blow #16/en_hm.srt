1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,219
The N64 upside down looks like a koala's face.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,459
And here's a wall that changes color
when you pee on it.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,639
Vsauce. Kevin here.
This is Mind Blow.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,198
This jet pack of sorts just set a
record by flying for seven straight

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,249
minutes.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,659
The company claims their current model
can carry a 250-pound man for half an

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,188
hour

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,739
at a max speed of 60 miles per hour.
But if you prefer to sit down while you

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,999
travel, try out his motorized

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,959
easy chair.
It's just a prototype, so you can't buy it.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,869
Or this monster.
It's a 1000 watt subwoofer chair

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,729
with two 16-inch subwoofers and it can
connect the iPods

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,898
or gaming consoles.
Apparently some people like to sit on recycled

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:45,999
computer parts

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,609
with Ethernet and ribbon woven seats encased frame.

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,019
And others like to sit on... wow.
The flexible

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,238
love seat incorporates an accordion
like honeycomb structure

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,628
made from recycled paper and wood.
It's kind of like a slinky for your

19
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,889
butt.
Get ready for summer with the Nerf

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,389
Thunderstorm. It's a battery-powered
super soakers, so you don't need to pump it

21
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,859
and it has interchangeable clips of water.

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,589
You could stay inside all summer
and just build a giant Lego wall.

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,719
You'll need 270,000 legos

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,089
and probably a bodyguard with a Lego ARC gun from

25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,868
District 9.
Or stay inside for thirty years and build

26
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:29,368
a toothpick sculpture of San Francisco.
There are

27
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,279
eight paths for ping pong balls to
travel along as they tore this incredibly

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,868
intricate creation.
Quick challenge.

29
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:54,919
Listen to this music box and see if you
recognize the song.

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,519
Time's up.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:05,119
Here's the mega answer.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,758
This is a prototype of a screen that
follows your

33
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,549
eye movements. By using a webcam with face
tracking software,

34
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,479
the idea is to make games like
first-person shooters seem even more

35
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,759
immersive.
And to make kissing less immersive,

36
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,089
here's a kissing transmission device.
Basically you make out with his strong

37
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,098
looking thing

38
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,439
and it transmits the data to affect the
other straw looking

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,739
thing and...
Guy getting struck by lightning.

40
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,369
A Russian figure skating couple won
a silver medal

41
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:46,169
thanks to their plumber-themed routine.

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,909
Finally here's an absolutely epic record-setting

43
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:59,159
Beatmania performance.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:07,239
I'm gonna leave you with a riddle.

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,809
"Only one color but not one size

46
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,839
Stuck at the bottom yet easily flies

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,059
Present in sun but not in rain

48
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,979
Doing no harm and feeling no pain

49
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,299
What is it?"

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,109
The genius of the week is going to be a number

51
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,339
scavenger hunt.

52
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,349
Here's how it works.
I've given 5 clues,

53
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,979
each clue leads to a number.
Three clues are on this page.

54
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,869
One clue is at Facebook.com/VsauceGaming.

55
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,099
And the final clue is in 'Weirdos of the
Month #2.'

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,659
Find all five clues, add up all the
numbers and give us your answer.

57
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,458
Leave it in the comments below and I'll
give you a hint for the clue in 'Weirdoes #2.'

58
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,479
Eurovision.
Good luck.

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,259
And as always, thanks for watching.

60
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,909
Vsauce.

61
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,649
Announcement time. First things first, we've
got a brand new video on Vsauce2

62
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,699
that's a little bit different.
It's a conversation with myself in a group

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,049
called

64
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,119
'Underbelly' where they share with me some creepy

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,639
Pokemon facts.
They're really knowledgeable, I think you'll enjoy it.

66
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,189
Speaking of you, it's about time you got rewarded

67
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,819
more. And so, over the next few months,
Vsauce is going to be expanding genius of

68
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,338
the week

69
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,168
to include more slots.
On our channel page right now we've got two.

70
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,559
One is the Genius of the Week that Kevin already
mentioned, but the second one is a brand

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,869
new title called

72
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,869
'Sauciest of the Week.'
This is for someone who suggested something really

73
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,969
cool to Vsauce.

74
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,759
Whether it was a private message or on
Facebook, whether it was an online game or

75
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,168
a cool

76
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,968
image or something to buy, or just a hilarious comment.

77
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:43,409
Now, for the first week I chose 'sofusser,'

78
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,779
because of all the cool things he made with
stuff that we recommended on DONG.

79
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,499
But here's the excellent part.
Each week the current winner

80
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,259
picks next week's winner. So, 'sofusser,' if you're out there watching and you see

81
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,659
something over the next week that was
suggested to us or someone put something

82
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,039
on Facebook you think is cool,

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,739
let us know. Send us a YouTube message and
let us know who you think should be the

84
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,668
next week's winner.

85
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,769
And then that winner will pick the week after
that. So every winner gets to pass

86
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,529
the crown.
It should be pretty fun to see what happens.

87
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,549
And, hey guys,

88
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,649
as always,

89
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,670
thanks for watching.
