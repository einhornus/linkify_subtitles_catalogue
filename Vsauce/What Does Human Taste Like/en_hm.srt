00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,349
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,759
Eating your own boogers

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,489
is gross, but it might be smart. Assuming you have

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,579
clean fingers, lung specialist
Friedrich Bischinger points out that snot

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,149
contains antiseptic enzymes that kill

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,278
or weaken bacteria. Reintroducing

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,099
those crippled microorganisms may allow
your immune system to develop antibodies

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,169
in relative safety. Now, that is good to know-

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,309
-nose. But is eating your own snot

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,069
cannibalism(?) Self

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,729
cannibalism. Just like a cow or chicken or
fish or fruit or vegetable you are made out of alot of

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:44,999
edible things. The meat on an average human
body contains 77,000 dietary calories worth

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,859
of nutritional energy. Yum(!) If you decide to
become a cannibal, just don't show up late for dinner

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,939
or you'll get the cold shoulder.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,269
Jokes aside, cannibalism is a major

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,619
taboo. It's off-putting at a visceral level.

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,389
Humans have dignity, they are more
than just skin bags full of organs.

18
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,149
They're more than just

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,069
something to put on a plate.
But human meat has been put on

20
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,209
plates... and in bellies.
There are reports of cannibalism occurring

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,589
in times of famine as a last resort, and because of

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,069
curiosity and art. In the late 1980s,

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,359
artist Rick Gibson publicly ate human tonsils

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,099
and other donated human parts in London and Canada.

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,329
In 2006, artist Marco Evaristti cooked and canned

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,069
meatballs prepared with his own body fat,

27
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,989
removed via liposuction. In 2011,

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,739
Dutch TV presenters Dennis Storm and 
Valerio Zeno cooked and ate

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,129
pieces of each other on a TV show whose title

30
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,279
meant "guinea pigs".
Because both of them lived, and

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,599
both consented to the act, they didn't do anything

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,889
illegal. One year later, a Japanese man posted

33
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,469
this tweet. Five diners took up his offer
and on April 13th, 2012,

34
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,548
they were served a $250 per plate meal consisting

35
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:20,649
of his genitals. A darker story occurred in 2001,

36
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,999
when Armin Meiwes ate and killed

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,199
a volunteer he found on the now defunct Cannibal Cafe.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,139
Although his meal ostensibly consented to the menu,

39
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,309
Meiwes was convicted of murder and

40
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,849
now, serving a life sentence in prison, has become

41
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,649
a devout vegetarian. Disgust aside, one question

42
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,559
remains. If you were to use your taste buds

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,439
to taste your

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,929
bud, what would it taste like? To be clear,

45
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,608
taste is a sensation caused by something
in your mouth chemically reacting with receptors

46
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:04,419
in your taste buds. Flavor is the even more complex

47
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,499
experience of taste, combined with smell, and
information, from the trigeminal nerve

48
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,098
about things like temperature, texture, pain

49
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,639
and pungency, as far as the cooked but otherwise

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,219
unadulterated spice-less, sauce-less flavor

51
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,988
of human meat. The late William Seabrook

52
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,768
provided, in my opinion, the best description.

53
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,818
While in West Africa, Seabrook
interviewed members of the Gear tribe,

54
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,529
people who

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,439
had eaten human flesh and found their
descriptions unsatisfactory. So,

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,179
when he returned to Paris he struck a
sneaky deal with an intern

57
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,259
at the Sorbonne and obtained a chunk

58
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,809
of human meat from an otherwise
healthy body recently involved

59
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,779
in an accident. He carefully prepared
the meat and wrote that,

60
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,439
quote, "It was like good, fully developed veal.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,419
Not young, but not yet beef. It was

62
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,568
mild, good meet with no other sharply
defined or highly characteristic

63
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,869
tastes, such as, for instance, goat, high game

64
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,488
and pork. The steak was slightly tougher
than prime veal, a little stringy, but not

65
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,969
too tough or stringy

66
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,759
to be agreeably edible. The roast, from
which I cut and ate

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,139
a central slice, was tender and in color,

68
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,059
texture, smell as well as taste
strengthened my certainty

69
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,348
that, of all the meats we habitually know, veal

70
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,549
is the one meat to which at this meat is accurately

71
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,658
comparable."
Seabrook never gave us any
recipes or complementary flavor

72
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,769
recommendations.

73
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,809
But that brings us to this video's
title's second meaning.

74
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,429
What does human taste like?

75
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,459
What does the human palate prefer?
Interestingly,

76
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,848
of all the possible combinations of identified

77
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,399
flavors we consume, human cuisine only features

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,538
a relatively small number of recipes.

79
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:01,629
A couple of years ago scientific
reports published a great paper on

80
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,189
the chemistry and networks behind food pairing.

81
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,259
Researchers took 381 ingredients used in
five global cuisines

82
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,749
and 1,021 molecular compounds known to
contribute to their flavors

83
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,049
and created a flavor network.

84
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,199
The size of the bubble represents the
ingredients prevalence in cooking.

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,168
The thickness of the lines connecting
ingredients reflects the number

86
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,009
of flavor inducing molecules they significantly share.

87
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,598
The researchers' flavor network backbone spans

88
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,838
fourteen different food categories
and is quite interesting.

89
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,019
By comparing this network to tens of
thousands of recipes

90
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,999
they found that North American and
Western European dishes tend to combine

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,709
ingredients that share

92
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,939
flavor compounds, while East Asian cuisine

93
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,369
avoids them. But that trend was caused by a few

94
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,478
out lighters in each cuisine, that,
if ignored, caused the difference in amount

95
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,968
of sharing to lessen. Those few ingredients

96
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:05,249
tend to be the most authentic. They tend
to be the most responsible for the taste palette

97
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,709
of a regional cuisine and contribute to this

98
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,459
illuminating visualization.
But some flavors don't go together

99
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,788
in any cuisine. For instance, orange juice

100
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:21,639
and toothpaste. Why does orange juice taste
so disgusting right after brushing?

101
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,329
Well, most toothpastes contain sodium
lauryl sulfate - a chemical that helps the

102
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,898
paste get sudsy and frothy during use.

103
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,879
That action helps pull brushed off
debris away from your teeth,

104
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,968
but sodium lauryl sulfate also
suppresses sweet receptors

105
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:40,449
in your mouth and destroy phospholipids that inhibit

106
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,788
your bitter receptors, making sweet orange juice

107
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,148
taste not so sweet and grossly

108
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,259
bitter, for up to an hour after brushing.

109
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,489
What interests me the most about flavor
is the fact that the

110
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,009
things that cause it eventually become

111
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,838
you! You are what you eat, scientifically.

112
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,569
Your body is always losing dead cells
but the elements and molecules you

113
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,569
ingest are processed by your body into

114
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,609
new body. Here's a fun way to think about it.

115
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,859
Under the direction of DNA, a cat

116
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,218
is made out of air, water and cat food.

117
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:24,879
That's it. Cats have less varied diets than

118
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,249
humans. We can taste sweetness but cats

119
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,129
lack the gene required to do so.
However, they can taste

120
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,119
ATP, a molecule that moves around
chemical energy for cells to use in the

121
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,699
body, which may be a sign to them

122
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,728
that they're tasting meat. The point is,

123
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,208
sights and sounds and textures and shapes and smells

124
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:50,398
are the names we give to things that
eventually become our memories.

125
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,148
But flavor is the name we give to the
experience of things that eventually become

126
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:59,359
our bodies. Contemplating the

127
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,489
flavor of human meat is gross. But think of it this way:

128
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,978
you're currently tasting human,
you're tasting human right now.

129
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,929
Your tongue and taste buds are in
contact with your mouth

130
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,908
almost constantly. Now, granted, it's more
of a passive thing - your mouth just

131
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,049
happens to contain

132
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,538
your tongue. You're not actually eating

133
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,158
yourself... but you kind of are.

134
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,999
Your body is constantly swallowing
your own mucus

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,999
and digesting pieces of your body like
dead cells from your tongue

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,639
and cheek. But that's nothing
compared to the self cannibalism

137
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,949
of the sea squirt.
The sea squirt lives a sort of

138
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,398
self-cannibalistic 'Flowers for Algernon' life.

139
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,849
When born, it resembles a tadpole
and has a notochord,

140
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,208
putting it in the same phylum as humans.
It swims around until it finds a nice place

141
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,268
to adhere. A rock, a plant.

142
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,369
Once stuck, it begins retrogressive

143
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,969
metamorphosis. Literally digesting its own
nervous system, eating the closest thing

144
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,509
it ever had to a brain

145
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,809
and lives the rest of its life in a
sensile un-locomoting

146
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,989
clump. It is a bit of a downgrade,

147
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,419
but they are prime evidence that the
evolution of the brain was spawned by

148
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,109
the need

149
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,949
to move as soon.
As these guys don't need to move around,

150
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,829
they eat their brains.
That is way more extreme than the self-cannibalism

151
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,059
you participate in every day

152
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,689
by swallowing. But don't feel bad.
About every three months or so

153
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,349
you swallow and digest your own

154
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,089
body weight worth of you.

155
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,909
That means that every day you are a
little more than one percent of the

156
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,789
mythical

157
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,909
ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail.

158
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,749
You are what you eat but you are also a thing

159
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,069
that you eat.

160
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,169
And as always,

161
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,670
thanks for watching.
