1
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:05,503
Hey, Mind Field! Vanessa here.

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:09,107
Just kidding. My name
is actually Michael.

3
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:11,676
That part when I said
that I was Vanessa...

4
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,611
that was a lie.

5
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:15,547
So you're welcome.

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,149
Humans love lies.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,517
More precisely,

8
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,320
we love things
that aren't entirely true--

9
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,788
because we have to.

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,690
It's often all we have.

11
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,193
Completely proving something
can be difficult,

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,361
if not impossible.

13
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:33,698
So instead, we have
the faith of the believer,

14
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:36,668
the confidence interval
of the scientist.

15
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,770
What we think we know,

16
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:42,207
we really only believe we know.

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,809
On this episode of Mind Field, 
I'm going to take a look at

18
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,745
a kind of lie
we tell ourselves.

19
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:55,587
And I'm going to use belief
to turn a lie...into a truth.

20
00:00:55,588 --> 00:01:09,434
 ( theme music playing )

21
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,203
Michael:
 If I'm going to harness 
 the power of belief,

22
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:15,573
 I need to find a good way
 to study belief and behavior.

23
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:19,310
 So I'm paying a visit to UCLA's
 Dr. Aaron Blaisdell,

24
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,279
 who I worked with
 on last season's

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,748
 "Greater Good"
 Trolley Problem episode.

26
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:25,650
 ( train whistle blowing )

27
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:27,919
Dr. Blaisdell,
great to see you again.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,387
Nice to see you again,
Michael.

29
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:31,189
Thank you for your help
last season,

30
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,692
but I've got this new thing
I want to look into.

31
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:36,327
I started thinking a lot
about belief

32
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:37,762
and how we form them.

33
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:42,534
Specifically beliefs about
what causes our behavior.

34
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,702
I want to be able
to break it down

35
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:47,205
and just look at how people
respond to the environment
around them

36
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:48,840
and how it changes
their belief.

37
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,709
Well, a Skinner Box
is a great place to start.

38
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,212
because what
I tell my students is,

39
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:57,215
a Skinner Box,
for a psychologist
like myself,

40
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:59,417
is like a test tube
for a chemist.

41
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,753
 Dr. Skinner, what are you
 doing with this pigeon?

42
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:05,490
 I'm getting ready to
 demonstrate a fundamental
 principle of behavior.

43
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:08,393
Michael:
 Invented by Harvard
 psychologist B.F. Skinner,

44
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,196
 a Skinner Box is a chamber
 in which animals

45
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:14,799
 can be isolated and exposed to
 carefully controlled stimuli.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,801
 In one of his
 landmark experiments,

47
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,370
 Skinner released food
 to pigeons in the boxes

48
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:20,972
 at regular intervals.

49
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,874
 What he found was that
 the pigeons seemed to believe

50
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,442
 that whatever
 they happened to be doing

51
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:25,944
 just before the food came

52
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,313
 actually caused the food
 to appear,

53
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,548
 and would then repeat
 that behavior over and over--

54
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:34,352
 for example, hopping around
 or spinning in circles.

55
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:38,323
 Skinner called this
 "superstitious behavior."

56
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,927
So what do you want to do--
what's your dream test?

57
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:46,998
Basically a replication
of Skinner's superstitious
experiment,

58
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,000
but instead of with pigeons,
with people.

59
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,936
I would love to see:
will people develop

60
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:55,707
their own sort of
superstitious rituals
or beliefs.

61
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,942
Have we done this
with people before?

62
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:01,779
I don't think
such a rigorous test
of this has been done.

63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:09,754
I think primarily, from
the literature I know,
it's pretty much pigeons.

64
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:12,257
B.F. Skinner's work
showed that if you

65
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,659
regularly deliver
a reward to a pigeon,

66
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,628
regardless of how
it actually acts,

67
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,596
the pigeon won't
figure that out.

68
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:22,600
Instead, the pigeon will develop
superstitious behaviors

69
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,936
as if it thinks
it is in control,

70
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:27,338
despite the lack of
any evidence that it is.

71
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:28,906
 But what about humans?

72
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,442
 Watching people form
 new superstitions

73
00:03:31,443 --> 00:03:34,646
 might show us how
 beliefs are created,
 but here's the thing:

74
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,448
You can't just put a person
in a Skinner Box.

75
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,684
People are quite clever,
and so instead,

76
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,519
along with Dr. Aaron Blaisdell,

77
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,921
I have developed
a much more elaborate ruse.

78
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:47,525
Welcome to Victory Vault.

79
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:50,595
 ♪

80
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:54,032
Michael: "Victory Vault"
 is a fake game show we made up

81
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,401
 to draw our
 unsuspecting subjects

82
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,003
 into taking part in
 a human Skinner Box.

83
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,773
 To accomplish this,
 we rented a sound stage

84
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,709
 and constructed what appeared
 to be a game show set,

85
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,511
 but was really our study.

86
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,846
 We outfitted the room
 with a checkboard floor,

87
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,049
 a button that serves
 no purpose,

88
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,651
 multiple cameras
 and a live microphone,

89
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:17,088
 all of which have absolutely no
 connection to winning the game.

90
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,059
 We also included
 an ATM slot on the wall
 where, instead of food,

91
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,661
 dollar bills would be fed
 into the room

92
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:25,396
 at regular intervals.

93
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:27,465
 Meanwhile, I would be
 playing the role

94
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,834
 of the executive producer
 of this new game show

95
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,537
 testing out the concept
 for a television network.

96
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,906
 Our first subject is Rebecca.

97
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,874
Yes, I know nothing.
I'm excited.

98
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,676
Excellent, excellent.

99
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,878
Well, I'll you some things
that you need to know.

100
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,482
One, you will get to keep
all of the money
that you get today.

101
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:48,920
The object of the game
is to collect as much money
as possible.

102
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,123
- OK. ( laughs )
- Now, you will have
 ten minutes,

103
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,559
and  that's all
I'm going to tell you.

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,964
- Go. OK?
- OK.

105
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:04,635
- Rebecca: OK.
- Michael (over loudspeaker):
  All right, Rebecca, begin

106
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:10,541
in three, two, one, go!

107
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,943
 Blaisdell: Of course,
 right to the button,

108
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,678
but she's not fixated on it,

109
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,046
she's definitely
looking around there.

110
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,814
Rebecca: I'm trying
to figure out

111
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,016
if there's, like, a puzzle,
or what this is about.

112
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,786
Am I supposed to just get out?

113
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:26,824
No, not supposed to get out. OK.

114
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,994
Oh! OK, there's money.
Is that one clue?

115
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,497
Rebecca:
 I've earned one dollar.
 ( laughs )

116
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,899
See? She's "earned" one dollar.
Earned.

117
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,135
I mean, she thinks she
caused it to happen.

118
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,104
Let's see. I think
I might be onto something

119
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,540
- with this door, maybe? 
- Uh-huh.

120
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,143
- OK.
- Blaisdell:
  The second dollar bill

121
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,546
came out really shortly
after she manipulated the door.

122
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:51,516
That's what Skinner would call
"adventitious reinforcement."

123
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,885
She accidentally just
happened to be doing something,

124
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,853
- and now look. 
- Hello?

125
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:58,656
 Look, it reinforced that
behavior,  look how strong it's
become.

126
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:00,591
Now she's doing a lot
with the door,

127
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:03,528
 and this dancing, just like
 one of Skinner's pigeons.

128
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,762
- Anything?
- See?

129
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:06,164
Michael:
 For the first two minutes,

130
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,099
 Rebecca believed
 a specific combination

131
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,600
 of the door and the button

132
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,169
 were triggering the money.

133
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,938
 She had created
 a superstitious ritual.

134
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,442
 But when her old ritual
 ceased to line up with
 the reward being delivered,

135
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,911
 she started exploring
 new actions.

136
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,612
Would you like to keep
sending money?

137
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:24,549
Is it something with this?
Hello, dollar bill.

138
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,851
Michael: This change
 in Rebecca's behavior

139
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:30,021
 indicates that
 she stopped believing
 that pressing the button

140
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,223
 is associated with
 money coming out.

141
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,225
 Skinner called this
 "extinction."

what if I dance? ♪

 she believes

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,064
 her new actions
 might connect to the reward.

- I did!
- Come take a seat.

152
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,984
So, first of all,
how'd it go?

153
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,620
Oh! Very confusing.

154
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:05,189
I wasn't able to
fully figure it out,

155
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,159
but it was something to do
with the 20 white squares
on the floor.

156
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,662
Something to do with
the red button as well,
like a pattern, maybe?

157
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:15,600
Oh! Maybe I should have tried
clicking on the button
20 times.

158
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,536
- Yes!
- OK, you wanna know what
 makes the money come out?

159
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:20,805
Yes. It's probably
something really crazy.

160
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:23,074
- It's just 30 seconds passing.
- Blaissdell: Yep.

161
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,109
- It has nothing to do
 with what you do.
- Ohh!

162
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,944
You would have gotten
the same amount,

163
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:28,980
but you could just sat
on the floor and done nothing.

164
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,815
- ( laughing )
- Yeah.

165
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:33,651
This is actually
a psychological experiment

166
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:36,554
based on some work done
by B.F. Skinner,

167
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:40,658
and we are looking at
the kinds of behaviors
people invent

168
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,760
that they think
controls the money.

169
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:45,630
- But I think
 this was fascinating.
- Blaisdell: Yeah.

170
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,798
- And you really do
 get to keep the money.
- Yay!

171
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:50,167
- Rebecca, thank you
 for your help today.
- Cool. Thank you, guys.

172
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,303
Michael:
 Rebecca's rituals
 seemed to indicate

173
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,539
 that she thought performing
 for the camera

174
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,907
 would work the best.

175
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,109
 Her beliefs about TV shows
 informed

176
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,778
 the kinds of superstitions
 she would create.

177
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,781
 But will other people
 develop the same superstitions?

178
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:06,817
 Or will it depend on the
 beliefs and expectations
 they already have?

179
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:08,986
The object of Victory Vault

180
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,988
is to collect as much money
as you can.

181
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:14,158
Oh, OK. Well, let me take
these accessories off there
really quickly.

182
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,694
As soon as that door closes,
your ten minutes starts.

183
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,195
I don't get to ask questions?

184
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,897
Not on Victory Vault.

185
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:23,968
Michael:
See you in ten minutes.

186
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,069
All right.

187
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,772
Where's the cash?

188
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,943
It's like an escape room.

189
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,278
Am I supposed to push this?

190
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,148
Blaisdell: Some people
 really wanted instructions.
 Michael: Yeah.

191
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,649
Contestant:
 I feel like if I push this,
 the time is gonna be up.

192
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,719
Michael: Like Rebecca,
 all of our subjects

193
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,721
 immediately gravitated
 to the useless button.

194
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,957
That button is so salient.

195
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,193
Push the button?

196
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:50,795
Oh, shit!

197
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,064
 ( Michael, Blaisdell laugh )

198
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,799
He was a little surprised
at that.

199
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,968
Push the button?

200
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,904
Oh! OK, I think I get it.
Is it push the button?

201
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,840
Will I push the button?
Am I supposed to
push the button?

202
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,142
( rapping ) ♪ If you're gon'
push the button, then you're
goin' with the button ♪

203
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,911
♪ And I'm pushin'
on the button-- ♪

204
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:09,046
Michael: It was clear
 that most of the superstitions

205
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:12,049
 began with the button,
 but evolved into something else

206
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,852
 very quickly,
 including this guy,

207
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:16,954
 whose superstitious behavior

208
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,757
 was doing absolutely nothing.

209
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,325
 Blaisdell:
 He's just standing there.

210
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:27,698
 Michael: Yeah.
 Will he do something...?

211
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,667
( chuckling )

212
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:33,704
Maybe taking the money
is...bad?

213
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,941
I know strippers get singles
for dancing.

214
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:39,644
 Blaisdell: Is he gonna dance?
 I hope he doesn't strip for us.

215
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,280
I can't dance like that.

216
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,216
Maybe I can sweet talk
the machine.

217
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,018
It's just giving me money
at this point.

218
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,786
I'm not doing anything.
( laughs )

219
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,688
 Blaisdell: 
 He's no fool.

220
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:53,391
He's not really showing
much superstitious behavior.

221
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,126
 Even in Skinner's experiments,

222
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,928
 not all the pigeons
 showed superstitious behaviors.

223
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:01,298
 Michael:
 Obviously there's a game,
 I called it a game show.

224
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:04,935
 But the money's
 just piling up
 like it's contagious.

225
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,003
 Oh, look!

226
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,438
 Uh-- Oh.

227
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:12,143
 He really doesn't
 want to push it.

228
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,880
Come on.
Press it four times,
out comes the money.

229
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,683
- Press it four times?
- Out comes the money.

230
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,285
 ( contestant laughing )

231
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:25,389
Press it four times,
out comes the money.

232
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,694
She believes that
pressing the button
is necessary, is a cause.

233
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,898
 And the ritual consists
 of a few actions
 strung together.

234
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,401
 Five, four, three...

235
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:41,072
 two...one, stop.

236
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,707
Can I push the button?

237
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,175
- Time is up. 
- Damn.

238
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,210
Stay where you are.
We will see you very soon.

239
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:49,046
I feel like I was
supposed to push the button.

240
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,148
Michael: Pigeons don't enter
 a Skinner Box

241
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,218
 with nearly as many
 preconceived notions
 as humans do.

242
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:57,755
 Humans come in with a rich
 diversity of expectations.

243
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:01,358
 Some think they need
 to perform for the camera,
 or make the producers laugh.

244
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:06,130
 This guy thought
 that the secret was
 to just be different.

245
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,365
Hold it! Oh, I thought--

246
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,367
Take a seat.

247
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,403
- What was that?
- Michael : Great work.

248
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:14,305
What made the money come out?

249
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,006
This is what I finally thought.

250
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:18,275
It was a test
not to push the button,

251
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:20,444
and then as I kept saying
a cer-- a word--

252
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,980
like phrase and "button,"
it kept coming out.

253
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,815
But I didn't know how
it was supposed to be phrased.

254
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,518
Hit that button.
Hit it a lot.

255
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,520
As if your life
depended on it.

256
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,489
I was thinking,
"What would people not do?"

257
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,091
- Hmm.
- Probably just stand there.

258
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:37,094
So I was like, well,
let's just stand there
and see what happens.

259
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:40,030
Maybe they'll reward patience
over impulsiveness.

260
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,366
- You started doing exercises.
- Man: Yeah.

261
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,934
I don't know if it rewarded you

262
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:47,238
for just being--
doing crazy things.

263
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,839
Did you learn anything?

264
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,076
That it was dispensing
like a dollar every,

265
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:54,912
I don't know,
like 30 seconds
or something.

266
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,881
You're right.

267
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,217
You had no control
over when the money
came out.

268
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:02,219
It's pretty interesting.
I'm wondering

269
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,890
- if that's because
 of who you are...
- Yep.

270
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,458
- Wh-Who are you?
- Blaisdell: Elaborate.

271
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,426
That's just like my thought
process, I think,

272
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,061
like I'm just very observant.

273
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,329
You came up with this great

274
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,498
entering-and-exiting-the-room
thing.

275
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:16,400
Tell me about that.

276
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,035
Because the money
didn't start coming out

277
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:19,970
until after I--
I waited, I waited, I waited,

278
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:23,040
and nothing came out
until after I left
and came back in.

279
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,843
You shoulda just
left me in there
to get more money!

280
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,846
You made a sistah
work hard for her money.

281
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:30,815
Michael: 
 Victory Vault,

282
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,818
a.k.a. human
Skinner Box experiment.

283
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,820
What are your thoughts?

284
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,355
We're really finding
that humans are susceptible

285
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:41,192
to superstitious
beliefs or behaviors.

286
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,027
You know what?
I totally agree.

287
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,597
Except there were some people
who were able to guess

288
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:50,835
with some degree of confidence
that they didn't have control.

289
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,505
Some people were probably
just skeptical from the
get-go.

290
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,473
- Yeah.
- And that's just
their personality.

291
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:59,043
Yeah, the beliefs
that people brought
into that room

292
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,313
really affected
what beliefs or lack thereof...

293
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:06,250
- ...they created in the room
once the game started.
- Yeah .

294
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,553
We're belief machines.
We're pattern seekers.

295
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:15,226
And there's even
a belief that in psychology
and in anthropology

296
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:19,363
that may be the way
a lot of rituals got started,
by accidental reinforcement.

297
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:23,567
And then it becomes
codified into a religion
or a cultural practice.

298
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:24,902
Hmm.

299
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:31,408
 ♪

300
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:34,011
Our human-sized Skinner Box

301
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:36,914
showed that when confronted
with uncertainty,

302
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:39,650
people often behaved
superstitiously,

303
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:43,187
under the belief
that they do have control.

304
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:46,323
But of course,
nothing anyone did
in that box

305
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,993
would make the money
come out any faster.

306
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,963
So those superstitions
were lies.

307
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:56,567
But sometimes
if a lie is believed in enough,

308
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:59,503
it can literally become true,

309
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,639
like a placebo.

310
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,108
Now, I've been watching
 a lot of horror movies lately,

311
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,410
and they gave me an idea.

312
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:10,047
If I'm able to find just
the right preexisting beliefs

313
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,149
to wrap around a placebo,

314
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,418
could I literally
make people believe

315
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:17,988
that I am possessing them
with a spirit?

316
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:22,693
I want to perform
a sham reverse exorcism.

317
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:28,565
 Exorcisms are not some
 Hollywood fabrication...

318
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:31,135
 and they didn't only happen
 hundreds of years ago.

319
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,404
 In fact,
 in the United States alone,

320
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,006
 there are currently
 50 priests

321
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:39,610
 endorsed by the Vatican's
 International Association
 of Exorcists,

322
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:42,579
 up from just 12 a decade ago.

323
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,448
 But what's a reverse exorcism?

324
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:46,317
 It's something I made up

325
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,086
 where instead of removing
 a spirit from someone,

326
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,255
 you put one in them.

327
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:53,490
 I want to do that because
 I don't think it's ethical

328
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:56,660
 to tell someone
 they're possessed by a demon.

329
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,495
But I'll need some help,

330
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:03,334
and I know just who to ask.

331
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,370
Michael:
 Dr. Veissiére, thank you.

332
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,339
I had a blast last season.

333
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,642
I think that the work we did
and the things you showed me

334
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:15,980
related to our
power-of-suggestion work
together on placebos

335
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,748
was so powerful.

336
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,516
Well, Michael,
it's a real pleasure.

337
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,285
I'm honored
to be here again.

338
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,053
It also is why you're
the person I thought of

339
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:24,521
for what I want to do next.

340
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:27,324
Building on the work
we did last season,

341
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:30,761
I want to explore belief

342
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,197
and what I can
and cannot control.

343
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,669
I want to perform an accessory-
assisted reverse exorcism.

344
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,738
- Hmm.
- Reverse exorcism

345
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,674
because I'm not gonna tell you
that you have a demon in you

346
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:46,543
or something in you
that I'm gonna remove--
you're fine.

347
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:51,115
What I can do is make you feel
like you're losing control.

348
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,450
You would like to
experimentally induce

349
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,386
a spirit possession experience.

350
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,254
- Right.
- I like that.

351
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:00,391
All right,
let's talk details here.

352
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:04,461
Are there things we can do
to increase the effectiveness

353
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:08,032
of our reverse exorcism ritual?

354
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:12,469
Yeah. I'm thinking
we could probably use
some tricks from hypnosis.

355
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,505
If we went them
to have experiences,

356
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,608
we need to suggest
those experiences
to them specifically.

357
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,412
We would be using a lot of props
from both religion and science

358
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,614
to get people's
critical minds
to relax,

359
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,150
and then we will throw in
some suggestions.

360
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,520
So we've got
religious iconography,

361
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,557
and we've got the paraphernalia
of medical science.

362
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:35,359
Let's do this.

363
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,561
Michael: Almost everyone feels
 a certain way

364
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,563
 in the presence
 of medical equipment,

365
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:42,266
 and, even though not everyone
 observes the same religion.

366
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,569
 Swiss psychologist Carl Jung
 posited that a person's

367
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,471
 belief in a religious symbol

368
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:50,674
 wasn't necessary for it
 to exert an influence on them.

369
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:55,479
 Consciously,
 they may say it doesn't,
 but unconsciously, it will.

370
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,381
 With Dr. Veissiére onboard,

371
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,816
 I had Mind Field's
 art department

372
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,218
 mock up our lab
 with plenty of scientific

373
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:05,389
 and religious iconography.

374
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,293
 ♪

375
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,563
Michael: With our lab
 dressed to Veissiére's specs,

376
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,700
 everything is in place
 for our reverse exorcism.

377
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,802
 Our five test subjects,

378
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,338
 pre-screened and vetted
 by a psychologist,

379
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,174
 arrived at the facility
 thinking that they were
 going to take part

380
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:28,178
 in a broad study on
 the science of religion.

381
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,280
 Immediately,
 we exposed them to things

382
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,182
 that would convince them
 of the seriousness

383
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:33,717
 of what they
 were about to do,

384
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:36,453
 such as filling out
 extensive paperwork.

385
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:39,323
( woman making announcement )

386
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,559
Michael:
 And an extended period of time
 in the waiting room

387
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,395
 to increase anticipation
 and tension.

388
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:48,198
 We even used a fake participant

389
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,300
 to talk up
 his amazing experience

390
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:52,469
 in earshot of
 the real subjects.

391
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,670
- Woman: Hi.
- Hi.

392
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,606
- How was it?
- That was crazy.

393
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,275
- Yeah?
- That was something else.

394
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,910
Michael:
 And to really sell
 the illusion,

395
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:03,413
 we used multiple actors,
 like a fake receptionist,

396
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:05,782
 a nurse to check
 the patient's vitals,

397
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:08,252
 and a pretend priest
 to add credibility

398
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,753
 to the religious angle.

399
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,755
 Dr. Veissiére played the role
 of a scientist

400
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:14,391
 fascinated by the power
 of the ritual.

401
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,193
 This should influence
 our participants,

402
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:17,895
 because how could this all
 not be real

403
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,765
 if a guy in a white lab coat
 is taking it so seriously?

404
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,800
So we are just about
ready to begin.

405
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,303
 Now, I'm watching hidden
 cameras that we have

406
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,438
 in the exam room
 adjacent to us.

407
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:33,644
Let's see what sorts of
altered states of consciousness
we can create today.

408
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,447
 Now, this is Jeremiah,
 and Jeremiah's been waiting
 for about an hour.

409
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:39,816
Actor/Nurse:
 So I'm gonna be
 placing this on your head.

410
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:43,220
It's called an EEG cap,
it just measures

411
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:46,323
 your brain activity.

412
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,292
This is a really important part
of selling

413
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,595
the scientific realness
of what we're doing.

414
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:53,931
Jeremiah,
very pleased to meet you.

415
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,566
Thank you so much for coming.

416
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,434
 Thank you so much again
 for your patience.

417
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:59,636
I think it's really important
for Veissiére to talk about

418
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,638
how what's about to happen
is special,

419
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,640
it's not a normal ritual.

420
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:06,543
In fact, it's not a ritual
that any lay people really
know about yet.

421
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:08,712
So the name of the study,
it's a bit of a mouthful,

422
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:11,748
so we're looking at
neural correlates
and physiologic markers

423
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:14,751
of ritually induced
mystical experiences.

424
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,853
 I have run this experiment
 about 30 times,

425
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:18,488
and some people enter

426
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,591
 some kind of encounter with

427
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,227
 what they may call
 a divine presence.

428
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,529
- Jeremiah: How's it goin'?
- Michael: Here comes
  the priest.

429
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,631
- I'm Jeremiah. Nice to meet
you, sir. 
- Father Callahan.

430
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:30,701
"Father Callahan,"
the Stephen King character.

431
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,936
OK, we might
have to change that.

432
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:35,739
Actor/Priest: Jeremiah,
 what I'd like you to do...

433
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,477
is relax, and I'd like you
just to casually stare

434
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:42,946
at the crucifix,
in the center.

435
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:45,249
Michael: We had our "priest"
 guide Jeremiah

436
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,783
 through a holy ritual

437
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:49,353
 which we told him
 was a thousand years old.

438
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,456
 But in actuality,
 Dr. Veissiére wrote it himself

439
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,626
 just before the demonstration.

440
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,361
 Actor/Priest:
 And you may feel a tendency

441
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,397
 that you want to
 let your hands raise

442
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,666
towards the sky
as your body falls away.

443
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,902
Michael: Getting someone
 to literally act possessed

444
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:09,506
 is definitely a difficult test
 of the placebo effect,

445
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:12,442
 so I'm not exactly sure
 what kind of results
 we can expect.

446
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,711
 However, I'm at least hoping
 that we learn from this

447
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:17,281
 how to better tap into
 the power of people's beliefs.

448
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,915
 Actor/Priest: Whatever
 the spirit needs to speak,

449
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:24,554
it will speak.

450
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:27,691
So now, as you keep relaxing,
as the spirit prepares...

451
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,961
 Jeremiah sat very still
 during the whole ritual,

452
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:33,497
 but we were curious
 about what he experienced.

453
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,765
So what
did that feel like?

454
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,366
Jeremiah: 
 It was weird,

455
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,068
 but I could feel like
 the presence,

456
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,836
it's a little graphic,

457
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:42,506
if some, like,
cut my head off.

458
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,609
- I didn't feel anything below. 
- Right.

459
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,611
Michael: People don't normally
 have feelings

460
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,646
 of decapitation and numbness,

461
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:52,449
 so either we've stumbled upon
 a way to summon a spirit,

462
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,019
 or our belief manipulation
 is working.

463
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,821
So we've been working together
on this project,

464
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:00,324
and I was observing you
from the other room.

465
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,627
And there are two
really powerful
kinds of symbols in the room.

466
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:06,396
Which one had the biggest
kind of visceral effect on you?

467
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:08,899
I guess it was kind of
a balance, because, like,

468
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,968
OK, it's religious,
and the nurse comin' in,

469
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:15,672
science-- it kinda
goes back and forth,
so I want to say "even."

470
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:20,043
Well, more has been going on
than what you know
at this moment.

471
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:23,113
Joe--Father Callahan--
was not a priest.

472
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:24,981
- Mm-hmm.
- He's an actor,

473
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:27,551
and everything that he read
was written by Dr. Veissiére.

474
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:32,489
We're looking at how
a thing that has no
known causal link

475
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,459
to any particular reaction
or behavior or feeling

476
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,828
can nonetheless
induce a feeling.

477
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,098
Michael:
 Jeremiah's experience
 was pretty curious,

478
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,035
 and since
 nothing too serious happened--
 his head didn't spin around--

479
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:50,107
 we felt more comfortable
 pushing things a bit further.

480
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,743
I'm the lead
behavioral scientist
in charge of the experiment,

481
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,778
this is my colleague
Dr. Stevens.

482
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:57,147
Michael: First, I interacted
 with the participants

483
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:59,950
 before the ritual,
 to build up their expectation

484
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,587
 of something happening--
 like...possession.

485
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:08,692
So today, you will be
listening to a reverse exorcism.

486
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:13,163
- OK.
- I'm already possessed.
 I'm already possessed.

487
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,565
Michael: We also decided
 to dim the lights

488
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:18,902
 to decrease their inhibitions
 and increase the atmosphere.

489
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:21,605
 Michael: I think it's gonna be
 great for our participants
 and for the whole mood.

490
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,740
I mean, it's spooky stuff.

491
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:26,042
Before you can fully
experience the divine,

492
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:29,045
I'll simply just invite you
to kind of relax...

493
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,881
Michael: And we decided
 to have Dr. Veissiére

494
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,749
 lead the ritual
 instead of our "priest,"

495
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,151
 so that he could use

496
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,052
 his training
 in behavioral psychology

497
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:38,021
 to harness
 the power of suggestion.

498
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,689
 The priest continued to serve

499
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,591
 as an important religious
 anchor point

500
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:42,993
 for the subject to focus on.

501
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,495
Veissiére: All of your
actions and reactions

502
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:47,497
gradually fade and disappear

503
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:51,568
as your body is now
approaching the divine.

504
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,170
You may notice...

505
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,139
your fingers tingling a little.

506
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:03,680
You may feel your mouth...
needing to tweak a little.

507
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:07,484
Her mouth is opening...
slowly.

508
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:11,621
As the divine 
tries to speak through you,

509
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:13,857
 filling your mouth, perhaps,

510
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:17,794
gently, ever so slowly.

511
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:20,730
You are now awake.

512
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,632
Good.

513
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:24,901
Michael:
 When the ritual ended,

514
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:27,838
 each of our participants
 had something very interesting
 to report.

515
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,673
He did definitely
have an aura around him--

516
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,041
the Father.

517
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,043
Woman:
 I could feel just

518
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,947
this everlasting joy
and peace of God
just covering me.

519
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,217
There was like
a glowing figure, man,

520
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,620
and then the cross
was like right in front of me.

521
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:45,255
We've got medical science

522
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:49,159
and we've got ancient
religious symbols.

523
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,761
And what we're
specifically looking at

524
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:56,066
is how the accessories
play into your expectations.

525
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,835
I liked the visual part.
I didn't like the audio part.

526
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,637
- Interesting.
- I wasn't connecting with it.

527
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:03,874
Woman 2: I've always thought
that the kind of traditional,

528
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,643
ritualistic parts of church,
they just never appealed to me.

529
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:09,079
I think it was more the symbols
that was more comforting,

530
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,147
because that's just
the way I was raised.

531
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:15,585
Michael:
 One of the most intriguing
 was our final subject, Miriam.

532
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:17,153
What was it like for you?

533
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:19,289
Um, I went to another place.

534
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,991
OK, OK.

535
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,794
I immediately felt my mother's--
her spirit with me,

536
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,263
 she was telling me...

537
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,131
- ...to come towards her.
- OK.

538
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:30,834
And when I got close to her,
she was comforting me.

539
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:34,271
- OK.
- Um, and I heard an angel say,

540
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,706
"I'm here with you.
I will never leave you."

541
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:40,710
 And I continued to see wings.

542
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:42,846
- Wings. Interesting.
- Yes.

543
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:45,682
Michael: Miriam's experience
 seemed to have

544
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:47,684
 a profound effect on her,

545
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:51,087
 but I wanted to hear more about
 what exactly happened to her.

546
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:52,789
When you say
that you saw things,

547
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,158
describe for me
what that was.

548
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,996
Was it like a daydream,
or was it more like, um,
really there?

549
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:01,865
It was extremely vivid.

550
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:05,635
Um, I could feel the wind
when it started going across,

551
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,738
I could vividly see my mother
standing there, smiling at me.

552
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:11,007
- She looked beautiful.
- Wow.

553
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:14,644
Michael: The fact that Miriam
 had an out-of-body experience

554
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:17,814
 and saw her deceased mother,
 was almost puzzling,

555
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:21,017
 because everything we did
 in the room was a lie.

556
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:23,286
 The priest was not real,

557
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,655
 the ritual was not
 a thousand years old,

558
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,792
 the nurse was an actress,
 but yet Miriam's experience

559
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:32,062
 and those of the other
 participants were real.

560
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:36,032
The thing that surprised me
the most today

561
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:41,371
was how personal
every single moment was.

562
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:45,108
I think because of a combination
of the powerful imagery,

563
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,344
both religious and scientific,

564
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,013
it becomes the most powerful
experience they've had.

565
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:52,782
Even if you're
a very staunch atheist,

566
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:54,784
a cross and a lectionary,

567
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:56,286
these things,
they're pregnant with meaning.

568
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:59,289
We seem to have found
that by using those cues,

569
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,025
people were able to tune in
very, very deeply,

570
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:04,728
and to relinquish
their sense of self-control.

571
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,262
Here's a question.

572
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:10,166
What's the difference
between what we did today

573
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:15,071
and what an actual priest
can do?

574
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:18,108
That's a really
controversial question.

575
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,411
Um, I think the difference
is that, unlike the priest,

576
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:27,183
we understand the mechanisms
through a more psychological
route,

577
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:30,220
whereas many priests
may themselves be convinced

578
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,922
that they are facilitating
communication with the divine.

579
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:34,958
And perhaps they are.

580
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,327
The results can be the same,

581
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:40,897
regardless of the intentions
of the facilitators.

582
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:44,034
There's no way to prove
whether or not

583
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:47,404
God worked in this room today.

584
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,874
I guess ultimately,
with the tools of science,
no, there isn't.

585
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:58,915
These are still
some really difficult
philosophical questions.

586
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,451
Michael:
 So, we have demonstrated that

587
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:04,387
our brains are belief-making
machines.

588
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:08,124
Rather than accepting confusion
and uncertainty,

589
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,827
we create superstitions
and beliefs

590
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:14,731
that make us feel like
we have control over our lives.

591
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:17,967
In fact, to not form
a superstition

592
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:20,937
or belief or guess
about the world around us

593
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:22,706
is to be powerless,

594
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:26,943
even when superstitions
are unconnected to reality.

595
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,746
That doesn't mean
they can't be powerful.

596
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:32,382
Our "reverse exorcism" ritual

597
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:35,752
and its practitioners
were all placebos.

598
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:39,289
But the mere existence
of our subjects' beliefs in them

599
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,792
made them real
and transformative.

600
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:46,329
So does that make us all fools?

601
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,799
I don't know--
but I don't believe so.

602
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,401
And as always...

603
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:53,369
thanks for watching.
