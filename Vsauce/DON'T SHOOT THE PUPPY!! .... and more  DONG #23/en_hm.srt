00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,188
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And the Internet is a big place.

2
00:00:04,189 --> 00:00:09,649
So, let's take a safari through the World
Wide Web and find some cool things to Do Online

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,549
Now Guys.
Size it up with iruler.net.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,629
This website detects your monitor size and
resolution and renders an accurate ruler right

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,329
there on your screen.
If you'd rather brake the rules, freak people

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,849
out by sending them totally normal links made shady.

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,309
You see, instead of shortening links, like
most people like to do, this website makes

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:39,609
URLs look worse.
"5z8.info/hookers_how2printmoney"?

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,219
Seems legit.
Lovemonkeysw gave us a site where you can

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,558
build a fake Google result page.
So, for instance, I could have it search for

11
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:53,599
"Anne Hathaway's Secret Crush," and generate
a pic where Google responds "Do you mean Michael

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,409
Stevens."
Act even more strategically in Ice Breaker.

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,779
Plan ahead and cut carefully as you let chunks
of ice loose, not too big, mind you, for your

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,739
friend to break apart.
Exit Path is a beautiful game where you have

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,849
to deftly manage the arrow keys to quickly
escape.

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,339
The more seamless your flow, the more power
up speed you build.

17
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,339
Bullettoface49 impressed me with Realm of
the Mad God.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,339
An incredible mmo I've only barely started
to play, but the game is rich and easy to

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,459
learn.
If you're looking for the easiest to learn,

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,428
CandaceK007's got what you want.
You can level up in this hilariously simplified

21
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:36,978
RPG, the famous Super Press Space to Win action
RPG.

22
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:43,208
Seriously, the space bar is the only key you
need to use for every action in the game.

23
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,788
Still too complicated?
Well, evo2341 suggests mouse clicking competition.

24
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:53,098
Click start and then in 10 seconds click your
mouse as many times as you can.

25
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:58,309
I tried a few times and I got up to 79,
but I'm sure you guys can do better.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,769
But let's be serious.
Here's lulzMattR and Don't Shoot the Puppy.

27
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:10,599
Click start and then literally do nothing.
Any action you take, any move your mouse makes,

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,359
kills the puppy.
It's basically a game you win by leaving the

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,629
Internet.
If you'd prefer using your own hand as a gun,

30
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,159
try out Toon Crisis 2,
a great blend of live action and animation.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,189
By carefully manipulating the focus and more,
tilt shift photography makes real life scenes

32
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,879
look like miniatures, like toys.
And now, thanks to ONKC123 you can add a tilt-shift

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,299
effect to any photo after you took the picture.
It works best with images that have distant

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,909
backgrounds, like these from the last IMG!
of the artist who drew pictures in the desert

35
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,779
by driving over dirt.
Remember the HTwins' Scale of the Universe?

36
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,889
Well, their new version is super enhanced.
More items, more info and even more mind-blowingness.

37
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,839
For instance, the entire Minecraft universe
is nearly the size of gas giant Neptune.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,169
Negative Implode lets you upload your own
images and have an optical illusion effect

39
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,869
added that makes them seem to forever move
towards you.

40
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,269
Not trippy enough?
Make like adityaK96 and use your mouse to

41
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,259
fly through Barry Martin's Hopalong Orbits
Visualizer right inside your browser.

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,318
Jellotime.com
Dialectizer translates your favorite websites

43
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,989
into different dialects.
For instance, I can change the Vsauce channel

44
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,649
page to Redneck and all of a sudden, "What
is Cool?" becomes "Whut in tarnation is Right

45
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,209
fine?"
Oregon Trail was the first computer game I

46
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,318
remember playing, but it never had enough zombies.

47
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,789
Enter SwolfSteins' recommendation, Organ Trail.
You must choose a career in supplies and head

48
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,539
to safety, except instead of the wild west,
your opponent is wild brain-eating undead.

49
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,149
Now, if you wanna settle a dispute, use Googlefight.com.
This site lets you enter two different words

50
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,349
and tells you which one is the winner based
on how many Google search results they each

51
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,549
have.
Follow @tweetsauce on Twitter, like geniuses

52
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,458
everywhere, to recommend sites like NUKEMAP.
A map that lets you simulate historical nuclear

53
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,679
detonations and view the extent of their damage
depending on where you place them.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,639
It's like being an evil mad scientist, so
really before pressing detonate you might

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,939
want to press The Drama Button.com first.

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,699
So there you go.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,979
Some more things to do online now guys.
If you've ever missed a previous episode,

58
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,739
and there are a lot of them now, don't worry,
there's a playlist for that.

59
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,319
Check them out.

60
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,159
And as always,

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,380
thanks for watching.
