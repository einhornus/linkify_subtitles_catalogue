00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,559
A Big Mac hat, and a cat-bunny salad, it's
episode 45 of IMG!

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,009
This tent was pitched high up above the clouds.
The snow and clouds make it look like a sky-tent.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,649
But, can you find what's hiding in these leaves?

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,369
Make your Snuggy super by looking like Spiderman,
Batman, or Wonderwoman.

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,049
These double pupils are photoshopped, but
have you ever noticed that Sonic has it too?

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,179
His eyes are conjoined! They're like one big,
giant, white ball in his head, with two pupils.

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:44,029
Perfectlytimedphotos.com has some neat-o shots.
Lightning on water, head touching water, cat

8
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,369
not-yet-touching water, and a ping pong ball.
You're never too old to play.

9
00:00:49,370 --> 00:01:07,899
And now, some unfortunately placed price tags.
Enjoy.

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,329
Tyree Callahan invented this color typewriter.
The keys use pastels to generate art, and

11
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,169
this poor seal was abandoned by all the other
seals because he was born a ginger.

12
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,629
Wet suits are funa and so are baby dolphins.
But let's get cuter. This dog is getting a

13
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:34,158
bear hug. Not enough? How about a Chimpanzee
feeding a tiger cub or tiger's licking.

14
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,379
Better yet? This guy who, no kidding, actually
stole a photographer's camera and snapped

15
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,279
these photos of himself.

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,529
Now, all of these animal images were on Buzzfeed's
list, a site where typing to Konami code rewards

17
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,029
you...kind of.

18
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,969
By the way, you can still play Pacman on Google
by going to Google.com/pacman.

19
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,228
And this product is not available yet, but
it's genius. Hamburger wrapping paper. Stack

20
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,309
gifts to make custom burgers.

21
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,409
If you have expensive tastes, try these name-brand
cereals concepts.

22
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,649
Artist Tim Schneider makes the world a better
place by putting big old eyeballs on things.

23
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,579
And this road in Norway looks like it goes
nowhere. But actually, it's just an oddly

24
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,899
curved bridge.

25
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,979
Now let's learn.

26
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,059
Dailyinfographic.com is sweet. Here's a history
of the word "Geek." From the word's origins

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,949
in the 1500's as "Gecken," meaning a "fool,"
to the middle period when it meant someone

28
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,089
obsessed with technology, or a certain subculture,
to the modern "Geek Chic" meaning where a

29
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,029
"geek" or "gleek" is a revered title.

30
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:43,079
And how about this one covering the chemicals
your skin takes in? Your skin absorbs 60%

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,029
of every topical product you put on it. Furthermore,
in her lifetime, the average girl will involuntarily

32
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,549
eat 4 pounds of lipstick.

33
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,109
On the subject of infographics, and charts,
and graphs, take a look at this: it's an illustration

34
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:04,809
of the Turkish empire's reach, made in 1801
by William Playfair, and it was the very first

35
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,529
piechart ever drawn by humans. Neat, huh?

36
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,249
On Monday I tweeted my excitement for owning
this book, because shadows are magic. Like

37
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,539
these two strangers who passed by each other,
though their shadows told a different story.

38
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,488
I also tweeted this illusion demonstrating
Troxler's Fading. Blurry, or faint colors

39
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,269
will disappear from your periphery if you
stare long enough.

40
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:35,249
Finally, I shot a gun for the first time in
my life. Destin was there with me and he

41
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,488
has this excellent scientific method for recording
muzzle flash and the shooter. You go from

42
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:42,519
this, to this.

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,999
He's gonna have a video soon where he explains
the entire process and how he made the photos

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,949
happen. But, in the meantime, check out this
video of the very moment I fired a gun for

45
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,159
the first time.

46
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,869
"You are the man. You're the man!"

47
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,719
Phew, that felt pretty good.

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,779
And as always,

49
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,180
thanks for watching.
