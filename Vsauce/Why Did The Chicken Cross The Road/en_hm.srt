00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,519
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,419
I've got a question for you.
Why did the chicken cross the road?

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,419
Brilliant question. Let's find out why.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,619
Historically, the chicken crossed the road
to get to the other side. Has anybody ever

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,379
laughed at that joke? Why has it become so
famous? And, for that matter, who cares? Why

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,929
would you want to investigate why things are
funny? As E.B. White said "analyzing humor

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,839
is like dissecting a frog - few people are
interested, and the frog dies."

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,439
But I want to dive into the guts of this chicken
joke because today it is so famous, it is

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,789
practically shorthand for comedy. And people
frequently consider it either the worst joke

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,799
of all time or the oldest joke.
But neither of those is true.

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,519
But first things first. The chicken joke
isn't technically even a joke. It's an "anti-joke."

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,719
It's a joke about jokes. You see, we expect
a joke to surprise us, to flip things around

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,858
or use word play. But to get to the other
side is just obvious, it's mundane, which,

14
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:14,148
by itself, can be pretty funny. To make this
more clear, let's take a look at anti-joke

15
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:21,928
chicken. "What's blue and smells like red
paint? Blue paint." You see, you expect a

16
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:28,398
typical joke-y punch line, but instead what
you get is hilariously serious. Anti-Joke

17
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:35,419
Cat is another good one. "Knock knock." "Who's
there?" "Lettuce." "That's impossible."

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:42,728
"Yo momma's so fat, we are all extremely concerned
for her health." Anti-jokes can also be used

19
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:47,318
for psychological experiments right at home.
You may have heard of this one already, the

20
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:53,519
"no soap, radio" joke. Here's how it works.
Get a couple of your friends together and

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,918
tell them to all laugh when you're done telling
the joke, no matter what. Then, go find a

22
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:02,808
target who's not in on it and tell them some
version of a joke like this: "Two polar bears

23
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:09,877
were sitting in a bathtub. The first one says
"pass the soap." The second one says "no soap,

24
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:15,518
radio."" At this point, you and your friends
should start laughing uproariously, meaning

25
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,518
the target has one of two choices- either
be afraid of looking dumb and laugh along

26
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,848
anyway or say they're confused, at which
point you should tell them "what, you don't

27
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:31,318
get it?" and keep laughing. You wait until
the target gives into peer pressure and succumbs

28
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,879
to mob mentality and joins, despite the fact
that "no soap, radio" is actually nonsense.

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,699
As for being the oldest joke in the book,
"why did the chicken cross the road?" is far

30
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,759
from it. Tt's only about 160 some odd-years
old. It first appeared in print in The Knickerbocker

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,759
as a conundrum that really isn't one - an anti-joke.
If you want to look for the oldest joke ever

32
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,439
to appear in print, we're going to have to
go back 4,000 years to read some ancient Sumerian

33
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,919
proverbs.

34
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,259
The joke is essentially a cautionary tale
to never expect anything to be perfect. It

35
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,828
goes like this: "Something which has never
occurred since time immemorial: a young woman

36
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:24,248
did not fart in her husband's embrace." So...yeah,
the earliest known joke is a joke about a

37
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:28,388
woman farting in a guy's lap. So...cool...

38
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:34,688
All I'm sure of is that our proverbial chicken
did not have Agyrophobia. That's the fear of crossing

39
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:40,169
streets. But maybe the chicken should have.
I mean, crossing the road could be quite dangerous

40
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:46,708
for a little bird, which leads us to a quite
darker interpretation of the joke. Maybe this

41
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,768
chicken knew of the danger of crossing the
road. Maybe he knew what could happen. Maybe

42
00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:01,658
he was sad or lonely or knew what his fate
was. And so he decided to take control and

43
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:08,559
end it himself 
and crossed the road to get to the other side.

44
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,028

them tick away. But let's get back to the

47
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:25,839
joke.

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,309
Perhaps a better question than "why did the
chicken cross the road" is "why wouldn't chickens

49
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,728
be crossing the road?" I mean, to be sure,
the Earth is a big place and less than 1

50
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:42,688
percent of it is even paved, but there are
quite a few chickens on Earth.

51
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:50,029
To put this in perspective, there are about
500 million cats and, as far as we go, there

52
00:04:50,030 --> 00:05:00,478
are 7 billion humans. But chickens?
There are 24 billion chickens. We're outnumbered

53
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,779
more than 3:1. But if we cooked up every
single chicken alive on Earth right now, we

54
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,459
could fill enough KFC 16-piece buckets to
form a stack of them going to the Moon and

55
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,489
back three times. Unbelievable, right?
I mean, they all fit so nicely here on Earth's

56
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:27,769
surface, walking around with their characteristically
lean meat, which, because fat contributes so

57
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,749
much more flavor to a piece of meat than the
muscle does, may explain why chicken is such

58
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,809
a great generic meat flavor and why so many
other exotic meats we try later tend to taste

59
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,079
like chicken.

60
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,098
But let's get back to the question in this
video's title. Why did the chicken cross the

61
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:50,219
road? Well, to get to the other side, sure,
but there are many different motivations a

62
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,619
chicken could have for going to the other
side. Maybe it was looking for food, maybe

63
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,918
it was being chased by a predator. What matters
though is that we can never know because there

64
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:08,019
is no chicken. It's purely hypothetical, as
opposed to the equally famous "Mary Had a

65
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,719
Little Lamb," in which the lamb,
and Mary, were real people.

66
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,839
Mary Sawyer was an actual student at The Redstone
School in Massachusetts and one day her brother

67
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,878
encouraged her to bring her lamb to school.
Her fellow students were amused, as was visiting

68
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,288
student John Roulstone
who wrote "Mary Had a Little Lamb."

69
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:34,978
We have actual documentation of those real
people and events, but this chicken never

70
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:40,219
even really existed. So, asking why the chicken
crossed the road is just like asking "why

71
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,429
did the original writer decide that it should
be a chicken crossing a road?" Which means

72
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,059
that the chicken crossed the road because some
comedian in the 19th century decided that

73
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,299
you would probably think about it too much,
making the mundane "to get to the other side"

74
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,759
answer quite surprising.

75
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,109
To explain this, let's look at a computational
neural explanation of humor. In order to effectively

76
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,438
manage resources, our brains stay a few steps
ahead of what we're hearing, estimating what

77
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,279
kind of outcomes are possible. But when we
discover that we're actually being told a

78
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,158
joke, and none of our paths were the correct
version of what was being told, all of that

79
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:23,119
neural network energy needs to dissipate
and according to some theorists, that energy

80
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,259
moves into motor cortex,
causing convulsions - laughter.

81
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,279
Unfortunately, our poor chicken friend doesn't
illicit that response from us anymore because

82
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,878
we've all heard the joke. We know what to
expect when the joke begins. But we should

83
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,719
be proud of our chicken friend and the unknown
author who thought him up, because even though

84
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,329
the joke is so famous it's no longer funny,
even at a neurological level, it still stands

85
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,789
as a testament to just how complicated and
clever our comedy can be. Keep laughing.

86
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,879
And as always,

87
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,870
thanks for watching.
