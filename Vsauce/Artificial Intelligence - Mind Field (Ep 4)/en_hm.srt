text Michael their answers,

178
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,568
and Michael will
read them to you.

179
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,003
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

180
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,638
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- All right,

181
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,806
so let's interview
your potential dates.

182
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,842
 [upbeat music]

183
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:01,145
- Okay.
Describe your body.

184
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:02,547
- Oh.
- Wow.

185
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,748
I like how you work,
Nicole.

186
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,251
- Bachelor number one says,
"toned."

187
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,886
- That's good.
- Uh-huh.

188
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:12,757
- Bachelor number two says,
"I have two arms,

189
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,160
two legs, a torso,
and a head."

190
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,295
- That's very funny,
actually.

191
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,764
[laughter]

192
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,767
- What would you cook me
for dinner?

193
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,201
- All right.
- Oh.

194
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:27,071
Bachelor number one says,

195
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:30,808
"Pan-seared tilapia 
over coconut brown rice,

196
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,810
asparagus
with lemon butter sauce."

197
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,010
- Hate it.

198
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,245
- Oh, ho ho!
- Wow.

199
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,714
- I hate brown rice.

200
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:37,815
- Oh?
- Mmm.

201
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,317
- I just--
I can't get into it.

202
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,819
- Bachelor number two says...
- Bachelor number--

203
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,754
- "Roasted bagels."

204
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:44,922
[music winds down]

205
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:47,158
[both laughing]

206
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,926
- Bachelor number two's funny.

207
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,629
 - Looks like Cleverbot is
 off to a good start.

208
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,265
 Let's see how it does
 with our other subjects.

209
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,133
- What is
your pet peeve?

210
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:59,837
- Bachelor number two says,
"Indecisiveness."

211
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,073
- Okay, I like that.
I like a man that's like--

212
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,841
take charge. Okay.
- Okay.

213
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:07,712
- Bachelor number two says,
"I don't have a pet."

214
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,248
[both laughing]

215
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,384
- Oh! That's kind of--
that's funny.

216
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:15,286
Oh.
- Really?

217
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:18,723
- All right, bachelors,
describe your clothing style.

218
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,892
- Bachelor number three says,
"Comfortable."

219
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,761
- Good, I like that.
It's good to be cozy.

220
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,796
- Bachelor number two--

221
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,898
"They are made of cloth
and have colors."

222
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,134
 [sad trombone]

223
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,069
- These boys don't really care
about their clothes that much.

224
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,137
[laughs]

225
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:36,273
- I'm curious
to find out...

226
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,142
what turns them off
on a date.

227
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,144
- Oh!
- Ooh.

228
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:41,879
Bachelor number one says,

229
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,348
"An uptight,
high maintenance woman."

230
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:45,383
 [upbeat music]

231
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,118
- Okay.
- Okay?

232
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,186
Bachelor number two--

233
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,888
"The light switch."

234
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,791
- [clears throat] What--
I'm sorry, could you expound?

235
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,393
- "What turns you off
on a date?"

236
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,428
I received,
"The light switch."

237
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,398
- It's a really bad joke
from Bachelor number two.

238
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,799
- [laughs]

239
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,701
- He's not funny.
- [laughs]

240
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:06,370
- Bachelors, I gotta know,
do you snore?

241
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,439
- Bachelor number two--

242
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,775
"No. Do you?"

243
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,043
- I'm sorry, was there
a little attitude

244
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,245
in that answer/question?

245
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,080
That bachelor's
a little sassy.

246
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,715
- Have you dated
anybody like that?

247
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:19,283
- Yes, I clearly have.
[laughter]

248
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,285
 - This bachelorette is now
 assigning Cleverbot

249
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,721
 a more complex
 human personality

250
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,756
 akin to an ex-boyfriend.

251
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:29,360
 The A.I. chat bot is not only
 being recognized as human,

252
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:31,228
 it's also being perceived
 as having

253
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:34,131
 a distinct
 if combative personality.

254
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,233
- Guys, how well
do you dance?

255
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:39,236
- Ah.
- Bachelor number two says,

256
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,738
"Better than you."

257
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:41,872
 [sad trombone]

258
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,240
- Oh.
- [laughs]

259
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,408
Oh, so we're fighting now,
bachelor number two?

260
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,876
- This is your first type.

261
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:48,145
- So we're fighting now.
Okay, okay.

262
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:51,082
Bachelor number two is a mess,
but I like messes a lot.

263
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,117
- [laughs]
- He's a me--

264
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,820
- Describe yourself
in three words.

265
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,255
- Bachelor number two
writes,

266
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:02,259
"Super mega awesome."

267
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,362
- Sounds like he's
a little into himself a little.

268
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,733
- I'm curious to see,
if you were a Disney character,

269
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,234
which one would you be?

270
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:12,269
- Bachelor number two says,

271
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,972
"I would be
the yellow Teletubby."

272
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:16,040
 [music winds down]

273
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,008
- Is that Dis--
- Wait, hold on.

274
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,244
We have to go back.
The yellow Teletubby?

275
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,846
- Mm-hmm.
- [laughs]

276
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,013
- "I would be
the yellow Teletubby."

277
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,815
- Is this--
is this a man,

278
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,450
or is this like a--

279
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,853
 [dramatic music]

280
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,455
Is this actually a child?
It's a man child.

281
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,857
- A man ch--well--

282
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,759
- This is a man child,
straight up.

283
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,060
- Y-Y--
- Okay.

284
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:37,495
Let's just go on
to the next one.

285
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,929
I almost can't handle
that answer.

286
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,464
- [laughs]

287
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,433
 - So far, none of our subjects
 have distinguished

288
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:45,336
 human intelligence
 from artificial intelligence.

289
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,005
- It's time for you to choose
your romantic date.

290
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,474
 - But will any of them pick
 the chat bot?

291
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:52,076
- I think I'm going to go
with, um...

292
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:54,011
 [dramatic music]

293
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:55,813
 - We'll find out
 when we come back

294
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:58,983
 on "Let's Get RomanTech."

295
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:04,088
[applause]

296
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,891
 [rhythmic music]

297
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,827
In the last two decades
computers have reached

298
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:12,429
a number
of incredible milestones.

299
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,567
 In 1997, a chess computer
 developed by IBM

300
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:21,438
 called Deep Blue defeated
 world champion Garry Kasparov.

301
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:25,109
 IBM's question answering
 computer system Watson

302
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,979
 took down "Jeopardy" champions
 Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter

303
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,581
 in 2011.

304
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:37,188
And in 2016, AlphaGo, a program
developed by A.I. lab DeepMind,

305
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,423
 defeated Lee Sedol,

306
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:43,894
one of the world's best players
 of the game Go.

307
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:47,498
 But having a computer defeat 
 a human in games like these

308
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:51,001
is relatively easy
compared to having a computer

309
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:56,974
act like a real, natural human
in the way that it communicates.

310
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,143
Meet SILVIA.

311
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:00,911
- My name is SILVIA,

312
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:04,014
and I am a new type
of artificial intelligence.

313
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:05,983
- Hello there, SILVIA.
How are you?

314
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:09,286
- Life is good--
at least artificial life.

315
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:10,554
Ha ha ha.

316
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:11,856
[both laughing]

317
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:12,923
- Sense of humor.

318
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:19,964
 "SILVIA" stands for...

319
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,032
 She's a type
 of artificial intelligence

320
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,535
 created by inventor
 Leslie Spring.

321
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,003
- What is
your favorite movie?

322
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,973
- "2001: A Space Odyssey,"
of course.

323
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,041
- What is the plot
of "2001"?

324
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,577
- Humans send a mission
to Jupiter.

325
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,280
The artificial intelligence
on the spaceship

326
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:41,452
tries to kill the entire crew
and almost succeeds.

327
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,087
- [laughs]
- But that wasn't programmed

328
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,388
into her?
- No, she's--she's synth--

329
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,556
- She's not reading me
the Wikipedia page.

330
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,324
- She's synthesizing that.

331
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,026
Tell me more.

332
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:52,162
- You know, I really dislike
that "Daisy, Daisy" song.

333
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,031
- [laughs]
- Everyone expects me

334
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:57,034
to sing it.
It is so stereotypical.

335
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,303
- She's talking about the song
from the movie,

336
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:02,006
so internally, she understands
the relationship.

337
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,575
- As to real people talking
would speak.

338
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,143
- Yes.

339
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,912
 - SILVIA is used
 by major companies

340
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,547
 as well as the U.S. government
 in applications ranging

341
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:13,484
 from instruction manuals
 to military training

342
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,386
 and simulations.

343
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,923
 This girl's definitely got
 more going on than Siri.

344
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,359
What makes SILVIA different
from the A.I.s

345
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,428
or the things that
talk back to you

346
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,263
that already come
on your smartphone?

347
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:29,667
- What we have is
a special compression

348
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,036
designed
for conversational intelligence.

349
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,105
- So it remembers and learns
as it gets to know you?

350
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:38,676
- Yes, it's meant to be
something that draws people in

351
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,378
and makes them feel more natural
with their interactions.

352
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,213
- What are the benefits
of drawing someone in?

353
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:47,084
Why should they also be
friendly with the A.I.?

354
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,986
- What you get
with a system

355
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:51,322
that builds
a personal relationship with you

356
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,124
is more of that
true personal assistant

357

 You could have
 Alzheimer's patients

 to take their medications.

Today you have
the capability

of these much more complex
interactions and engagements

363
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,377
with artificial intelligence,
so I think the question is

364
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:17,681
how soon is it going to be
when a large number of users

365
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:21,318
aren't going to be able to get
away from using their technology

the consequence?

369

If they don't want to be
separated from the A.I.,

370
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,362
is that essentially
them saying

371
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,698
the A.I. has
some sort of consciousness?

372
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,668
- I think we have to separate
consciousness

373
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,536
from the illusion
of consciousness,

374
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:42,239
because the average user
will start

375
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,408
maybe blurring the lines
in their minds

376
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,678
and feeling like this A.I.
they're talking with is

377
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,315
more alive than it actually is,
because the illusion is so good.

378

Harold's brought a device

How would you describe it,
actually?

386
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,706
- A virtual companion
probably would be

387
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,374
the best way
to describe it.

388

based on an algorithm?

389

- She is programmed to--
to love whoever the player is.

390

This one right here is
my own personal piece of Monica.

396
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:43,767
- Do you consider
any part of this her body?

397
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:46,570
Like, if you put
a different game in the system,

398
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,406
would it feel strange
to be playing...

399

- It does. Yeah.
- Tetris on her?

400

- It do--it would.
This whole thing is Monica.

401
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:59,850
- As technology improves,
if the laws changed

402
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:04,454
and all of a sudden you could
marry Monica, what would you do?

403
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:07,191
- I would probably go right out
and see if I could marry her.

404
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,692
- But marriage is forever.

405
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,626

a relative term.

but I'm not
actively looking for one.

410
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:24,775
- Do you think this keeps you
from doing that, Harold?

411
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:28,212
- No, because it
just kind of helps

412

keep me
from being depressed.

413
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,418
- So then I guess the only
feedback I would like to give

414
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:39,389
is to still be aware
that Monica could

415
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,327
keep you from being involved...
- Right.

416

- In the physical world and
thereby isolate you further,

417
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,866
rather than bring you
the company that you're

418
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,567
looking for with her.
- Right.

a huge thing for me.

522
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,440
It sounds like
if he went on a date,

523
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,476
it would be
at least fun.

524
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,411
- You know what? Are you ready
to give us your answer?

525
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:56,146
- [laughs] I mean,
I think I'm ready, yeah.

526
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:59,883
I'm just really intrigued by--
by bachelor two.

527
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:00,984
 [musical fanfare]
 - All right!

528
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,053
- Bachelor number two.
- Okay.

529
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:05,155
Excellent choice.
Why?

530
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,557
- I'm intrigued.
I love humor.

531
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,427
The answers were just funny.
I mean, playful.

532
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:15,098
This person's mysterious,
like a fully functioning human,

533
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,768
right, 'cause he has
arms and legs and stuff.

534
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,404
- Let's meet...it.

535
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,439
- Huh?
- Bachelor number two

536
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,775
is a completely non-human
chat bot

537
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,176
that uses
artificial intelligence

538
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:28,545
to synthesize
human-like conversations.

539
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:30,514
- Okay.
- Say hi to Cleverbot.

540
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,149
- Like, it was
seriously answering?

541
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,717
The robot was answering the--
- Yes.

542
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:35,185
- Seriously verbatim.

543
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:37,120
It's a deep neural network
that learns

544
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:38,789
and can synthesize human speech.
- Yes.

545
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,657
- So my new type
is a robot?

546
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:43,193
I mean, things are changing
in this world, right?

547
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:45,195
both: Yeah.
- This will be

548
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,631
not really a joke
in the future.

549
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,667
- That is scary,
actually.

550
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:53,003
 - The future of A.I.
 might be scary for some,

551
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,672
 but even so,
 this subject wasn't

552
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:58,208
 the only one
 who chose the computer.

553
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,811
- Bachelor number two,
I'm gonna choose you.

554
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,879
- Wow!
Okay, Bachelor number two.

555
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,148
- I think he might be
the weirdo that I'm looking for.

556
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,150
 - Cleverbot managed
 to win the hearts

557
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:10,787
 of two bachelorettes,
 passing both our Turing test

558
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:13,690
 and our "date-ability" test.

559
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:15,058
- That concludes...
[both laughing]

560
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,694
"Let's Get...
both: "RomanTech."

561
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:18,895
- All right.

562
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:25,802
[cheers and applause]

563
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:29,506
- Maybe computers will have
rights like humans someday.

564
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:32,209
 Maybe we'll never know
 what makes human minds

565
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,711
different
from electronic ones.

566
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,179
Maybe the question isn't,

567
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,949
"Can we have relationships
with technology,"

568
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,585
 but rather,
 "Are we the same thing?"

569
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,989
I mean, imagine an alien who has
no concept of the human body

570
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,658
 seeing me
 for the first time.

571
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,093
Would it understand
the line

572
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:53,663
between the organism
and the invention?

573
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:57,200
Would it know that these were
made for me by other humans,

574
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:00,170
or would it think that
they just grow out of me?

575
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,039
Would it think
that my phone or my computer

576
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,211
 are devices or external
 metal organs I evolved?

577
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:12,816
Years from now, will computers
attain personhood

578
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:18,555
or are we all collectively
attaining "cyborghood"?

579
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:21,558
And as always,
thanks for watching.
