The human brain

 To better understand
 how this works,

114
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,528
 we need to look
 at what's going
 on neurologically.

115
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,965
What happens in the brain
during fear conditioning?

116
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:11,202
Well, what we know
is that over evolution,

117
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,771
over millions of years,

118
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:16,140
we've developed these
defensive circuits in our brain.

119
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:19,210
And the amygdala sits on
the front of the memory systems

120
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,778
of the hippocampus.

121
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,747
And the amygdala seems
to play an important role

122
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,982
in determining
what the danger is

00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,717

what we should be learning,
that is important to survival.

126
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:36,060
[Michael]
 Our brain actually
 has two amygdalae--

127
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,695
 one in each hemisphere.

128
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,163
 The function of the amygdalae

129
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,098

 ranging from the risk averse...

 to high risk-takers

became our ancestors.

136

They populated the world
with creatures like us,

137
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,189
organisms that instinctively
avoid and are averse to

138
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,959
potentially dangerous
sensations.

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,963

140
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,098
suffocation--
the need to breathe.

141
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,067
We don't think those feel good,

142
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,236
and you don't have to learn
to not like them.

143
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,705
Even a newborn
is distressed by them,

144
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:24,909
which makes them
"innate aversions."

145
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,779
Fear is the anticipation
of these innate aversions.

146
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,916
 When the purple square was
 paired with electric shocks,

147
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,652
 my amygdala quickly made
 that association

148
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:37,555
 and began consciously
 and unconsciously

149
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,891
 arousing fear in me
 whenever I saw it.

150
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:44,295
For this reason, I want us to
think of sensations as flies

151
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,765
and our amygdala as
a meaty little spider

152
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,801
spinning a web of fear.

153
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:56,240
[thunder crackling]

154
00:07:56,241 --> 00:08:00,278
[Michael]
 The web is pre-stocked
 with our innate aversions.

155
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,148
 Whenever an experience
 is associated with
 an innate aversion,

156
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,951
 it's like a fly
 landing on the web.

157
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:09,253
 This alerts
 the amygdala spider,

158
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:11,689
 which weaves
 a powerful connection

159
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,891
 between that experience
 and the innate aversion

160
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,693
 it's associated with.

161
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:18,996
 In my case,
 that innate aversion was pain.

162
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,766
 which probably isn't the
 scariest thing for everyone,

163
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,702
 because, well, some people
 have a high pain tolerance.

164
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,605
 Others can learn to suppress 
 their fear of pain.

165
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,607
 And, of course,
 some people enjoy pain.

166
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:32,610
 But the point is,
 now that new experience

167
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,012
 will stay trapped 
 in your web of fear,

168
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:38,582
 a new member of the library
 of things that scare you.

169
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,086
 To find the scariest thing,
 we must wander through

170
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,288
 the darkest recesses
 of the web.

171
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:46,791
Everything caught in
your web of fear

172
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,827
is somehow connected
to death.

173
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:51,796
Avoiding it--surviving--

174
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,031
is, after all,
what makes fear useful.

175
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:57,034
It's why we are still here
today as a species.

176
00:08:57,035 --> 00:09:02,306
So if death is at
the very center of
all of our webs of fear,

177
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:06,811
does that make death
the scariest thing?

178
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:11,682
[Michael]
 Well, although many people
 say death is their #1 fear,

179
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:13,818
 not everyone is afraid of it.

180
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,621
 Many acts of courage require
 caring more about others

181
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,289
 than your own life.

182
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,225
 Some older people say
 they're ready to die.

183
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,961
 And what about those
 who commit suicide?

184
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:27,098
 Sadly, for them,
 something else was scarier

185
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,800
 than ending their own life.

186
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:33,204
So death isn't exactly
the answer we're looking for.

187
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:38,009
The scariest thing will
be something else on all
of our webs

188
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:46,817
that is panic-inducing
even to those who want to die.

189
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:49,854
[projector whirring]

190
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,923
[car rattling]

191
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:56,394
Dangnabbit!
Wouldn't ya know it?
I've run out of gas.

192
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,930
Guess I'm just gonna
have to walk down this
desolate, foreboding road

193
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:03,067
in search of a gas station.

194
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:05,870
Luckily, this is just a movie.

195
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,706
My rational mind
knows that I'm safe,

196
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:13,110
and it will use that to inhibit
my amygdala's fear response.

197
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,212
[laughs]
What a great way

198
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,448
to make a horror film scarier,
right?

199
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,084
Take away one of
the rational mind's shields,

200
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:23,120
and the amygdala's fear response
won't be as inhibited.

201
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:25,756
What we're about to see
really could happen,

202
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:30,061
and perhaps...will.

203
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,097
[Michael]
 Of course,
 we don't just learn fears

204
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:36,200
 from firsthand experiences.

205
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:40,271
 Throughout our history,
 we have used images and words

206
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,973
 to teach fears to one another,

207
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:47,011
 to prepare the next generation
 for various dangers.

208
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:48,813
[narrator]
 These high school boy and girls

209
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,415
 are having a hop
 at the local soda fountain,

210
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,918
 innocent of a new
 and deadly menace

211
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,920
 lurking behind closed doors.

212
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,056
 Marijuana! The burning weed

213
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:02,193
 with its roots in hell.

214
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,430
Why do humans
have to tell stories
to share fears

215
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:09,300
from generation to generation
and person to person?

216
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,469
Language is virtual reality.

217
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,305
So when you
tell someone a story,

218
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,408
you're not just describing
a crocodile, for example,

219
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:21,479
the language in the story
has a kind of emotional impact
on the listener.

220
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,782
So when I tell you some
scary story about crocodiles,

221
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:27,918
the amygdala is being activated
by the words and the scenarios,

222
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,354
allowing the imagination
to sort of play

223
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:33,824
with these ideas and scenarios,
so you're concocting imagery.

224
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,326
So it has a double whammy.

225
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,194
And you're getting
a very good sense

226
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:40,131
that you should stay away
from this kind of thing
in the future.

227
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:44,401
As a species, we're very
dependent and vulnerable
compared to other animals.

228
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:48,305
We don't have
sharp teeth and big claws,
and we're not really fast--

229
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:51,876
it takes us years and years
to be self-sufficient.

230
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,211
So what's happening during
those years of development

231
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:58,215
is that we're getting
all this information about
the environment through stories.

232
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:02,553
And part of that
is to know what to be afraid of
and what to not be afraid of.

233
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:05,156
[projector whirring]

234
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,057
[echoing]
Hello!

235
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:09,827
-Hey, hello!
-[bird cawing]

236
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:12,930
Whoo. Okay, being alone
is kind of scary, right?

237
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:17,034
But you know what?
I'm actually not alone.
I am always connected.

238
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,336
- [ominous motif plays] 
- No reception. Of course.

239
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:22,339
I mean, what is this,
a horror movie? Yes, it is.

240
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,009
And you know what,
I'm actually getting
a little bit scared right now.

241
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,846
A new fear, by the way,
has developed in just
the last few decades.

242
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,081
You see, a while ago,
no one had a cell phone.

243
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:33,317
No one was ever connected
through the internet constantly.

244
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:36,020
But now many of us,
most of us, are.

245
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,955
And so that's the new normal,

246
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:40,224
and what's abnormal now
is not being connected,

247
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,026
not having your phone.

248
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,894
Psychologists
give that fear a name,

249
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,496
it's a real thing
that's being studied,

250
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:48,432
and it's called nomophobia.

251
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,167
Anyway, the point is,

252
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:53,170
the scariest thing possible--
hmm, what could it be?

253
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:56,473
Well, an important ingredient
might be...

254
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,509
[fly buzzing]

255
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,013
 ...our innate aversion
 to isolation.

256
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:05,349
Why are we afraid
of being alone?

257
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,451
Human beings are social animals.

258
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,353
We need each other to survive.

259
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:12,356
So if we're alone, it lessens
our chances of survival.

260
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:14,425
And there's been
a lot of research now

261
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,361
that shows that when people
isolate socially,

262
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:20,130
it actually leads to things
like increased heart problems,

263
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:23,868
increased cancer risk,
physical issues, mortality.

264
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:28,873
It is very much directly tied
to the sense of survival
and avoidance of death.

265
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,208
What I find interesting
about isolation is,

266
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:32,977
I think it helps us capture

267
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,113
a lot of tertiary-and-beyond
fears

268
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:39,383
that don't seem to be
directly connected to death,

269
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:42,253
but are, in a way,
through isolation.

270
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,356
For instance,
the fear of public speaking.

271
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,359
Yes. Well, that taps
into your fear of rejection,

272
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,996
and when you feel like
people don't like you,
you feel alone!

273
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,098
And so putting yourself
out there,

274
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,134
having that possible fear
of rejection

275
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,303
when you're speaking in public

276
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:00,938
and not knowing how people
are gonna perceive you,

277
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,273
that's very scary
for a lot of people.

278
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,275
Which doesn't
necessarily mean

279
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,510
that you will directly die.

280
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:11,048
However, it connects
to our innate aversion
to isolation

281
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:14,985
which, through evolution,
we have learned is a bad thing
that can lead to death.

282
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:18,055
- And so we're afraid of it,
avoid it.
- Absolutely.

283
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:20,624
In the very first episode
of Mind Field,

284
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,295
I spent 72 hours
in an isolation chamber.

285
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:28,299
 For three days
 I had no contact
 with the outside world.

286
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,469
 I had no clock or window,
 and the lights never went out.

287
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,105
The scariest part, though,
wasn't being alone.

288
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:38,242
 I could handle that.
 The worst part

289
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:41,078
was being separated
from the natural cycles
of the Earth

290
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,413
I was so accustomed to.

291
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,616
 Night and day. Time.

292
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:49,386
 The disorientation
 and helplessness caused by that

293
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,155
 made me distressed,

294
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,423
and may have been a reason why,

295
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,459
while in the room,
all of my dreams

296
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,294
also took place
in the same room.

297
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,363
 I soon became unable
 to tell the difference

298
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:01,532
 between when I was dreaming
 and when I was awake.

299
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,001
 I was terrified.

300
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:07,504
Extreme isolation like that
is not normal or healthy,

301
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:09,540
but we all respond differently.

302
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,142
There are people who love
living by themselves

303
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:13,477
in the middle of nowhere.

304
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:16,080
And with sufficient forewarning
of the effects,

305
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,048
I think I could have
handled it better.

306
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,516
So just being all alone

307
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:22,486
probably isn't
the scariest thing.

308
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:25,222
So then what is?

309
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:28,525
[projector whirring]

310
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:33,597
Ah. You know what
would make this scarier?

311
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,766
Perfect.

312
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:38,702
[wolf howling]

313
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:41,605
[fly buzzing]

314
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:44,108
Let's talk about
fear of the dark.

315
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,178
Children and adults,
and myself, often,
don't like the dark.

316
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:49,580
- No.
- Why?

317
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,281
The sensory deprivation.

318
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:54,351
It leads you to feel like
you're out of control,

319
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:57,221
like you don't know
what's gonna be happening.

320
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,522
And, at the same time,

321
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,724
predators tend to
come out at night,

322
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:03,260
so when we think back
to caveman days,

323
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:06,363
they tend to attack
later on in the day
when you can't see them.

324
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:10,434
And so there's a natural
inclination for us
to fear the dark,

325
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,569
because we don't know
what's lurking out there

326
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,205
and there's a lot of things
that can come and hurt us.

327
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,740
My wife is pregnant
right now.

328
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:19,476
I mean, it's pretty dark
inside my wife.

329
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,345
Is my kid scared of the dark
in there?

330
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,813
- Nope. Nope.
- Why?

331
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,782
It's comforting for them.
And in fact,

332
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,484
if a baby is colicky,
they can't be soothed,

333
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,754
if you put them in a dark room,
they calm down.

334
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:33,090
In fact,
this fear of darkness

335
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,793
doesn't really come out
for most children

336
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,095
until about the age of two.

337
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:41,265
That's when, I think,
they start to develop
certain cognitive

338
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,467
and neural memories and maps

339
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,769
about things that might
be scary about the dark.

340
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,073
For example, your parents
tend not to be in bed with you
necessarily.

341
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,375
They're gone.
So these are the people
who were protecting you.

342
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:53,210
Well, it's dark,
you're going to bed

343
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,345
and they go to their room
and you're by yourself.

344
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:59,316
So to answer the question,
"What's the scariest thing
possible,"

345
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:02,453
the darkness isn't necessarily
the best one, 'cause
if a newborn walked in--

346
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,621
well, I don't know
how they're walking,
but just go with me--

347
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:08,291
a newborn walks in,
it's not gonna be like,
"Aah! It's dark!"

348
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,094
They'll just be like,
"Hmm."

349
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,828
Right. "Hmm, it's kinda nice."

350
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,765
And you know who else
isn't scared of the dark?
A blind person.

351
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:18,102
Exactly. So darkness,
I'm crossing that off my list.

352
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,470
Not universal.

353
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,139
- [projector whirring]
- [wolf howling]

354
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,476
[Michael]
 So if messing with our sense
 of sight isn't scary enough,

355
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,112
 what about
 our sense of hearing?

356
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:37,654
[woman screaming]

357
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,724
Okay,
I'm pretty scared right now.

358
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,726
But I could be more scared.

359
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:47,364
[man screaming manically]

360
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,867
[evil laughter]

361
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:54,404
[chorus of screaming, cackling]

362
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:59,276
Why is it so easy
to condition a fear
using sound?

363
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:02,446
Sound has a specific
neural pathway in the brain

364
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,748
which goes from
the auditory cortex,

365
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,784
thalamus, straight
into the amygdala.

366
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:09,887
Now, the funny thing
about sound is,

367
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,523
our visual system
allows us to see a threat

368
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,792
and prepare for it,
but sounds don't.

369
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:18,595
The rustle of some leaves, 
the footsteps in the distance,

370
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,764
evokes anxiety,

371
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,901
it evokes a situation which
we don't know how to respond,

372
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,770
because we've not seen
a threat yet, we don't know
what it is.

373
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,338
- Much less information.
- Yes.

374
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,274
[thunder crashing]

375
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,309
- [animal growls]
- [owl hoots]

376
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,446
Sound is a very immediate
processing within the brain.

377
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:40,317
So a loud sound
creates a startle
for anybody, immediately.

378
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:42,853
- staccato chord plays]
- But also some of these
eerie sounds

379
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:46,356
that you'll hear, they make
the hair on the back
of your neck stand up,

380
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:50,894
it's basically hijacking
your fear system very directly.

381
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:53,597
[ethereal noise echoing]
 Ch-ch-ch, ah-ah-ah...

382
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:56,366
 ch-ch-ch, ah-ah-ah...

383
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,936
[Patrick Brice]
 The first time I heard
 the "ch-ch-ch...

384
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:03,240
ah-ah-ah, ch-ch-ch," from
the Friday the 13th movies,

385
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:06,577
 that stuck with me forever.

386
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,679
- [gasping]
- [man groans]

387
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,547
 [thunder crashing]

388
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:13,317
 [bucolic music playing]

389
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,988
[Sean Cunningham] 
 Music tells you how
 you're supposed to feel.

390
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,457
 [slashing violins playing]

391
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,426
[screaming]

392
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:28,332
And I believe
that we are hardwired
to respond to music.

393
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,434
 In dramatic musical writing,

394
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,970
 you can use all kinds
 of different devices...

395
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,571
- [ethereal sounds] 
- Must be my imagination.

396
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:38,408
 ...to create fear.

397
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:41,645
- [slashing violins play] 
- [screams]

398
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:47,251
Here I am
walking through the woods.

399
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,320
And here I am
walking through the woods...

400
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,489
with scary music.

401
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,293
 [violin playing
 suspenseful motif]

402
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,629
[Michael]
 But if one note is scary...

403
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,330
 [introduces
 dissonant harmonies]

404
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,766
 ...two notes
 can be even scarier,

405
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,969
 especially
 if they're dissonant.

406
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,372
[Dr. Asma]
 There are certain intervals,

407
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,507
 two notes that are clashing
 with each other,

408
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,442
 that universally bother people.

409
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:15,912
They put you in a kind of almost
fight-or-flight situation.

410
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:17,781
[Michael]
 Musical intervals that fall

411
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:19,816
 outside of conventional
 harmonies

412
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,853
 may trigger our innate aversion
 to things that are different

413
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,688
 or abnormal.

414
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:27,057
[dissonance continues]

415
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,694
 This interval,
 known as the "Devil's Tritone,"

416
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:33,530
 is so dissonant that composers
 purposefully use it

417
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:35,299
 to make listeners
 uncomfortable,

418
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,768
 from TV themes
 like "The Twilight Zone..."

419
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,536
 [guitars play
 dissonant harmony]

420
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:40,904
 ...to hard rock like the start

421
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,340
 of Jimi Hendrix's
 "Purple Haze."

422
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:45,342
 [guitar playing tritone motif]

423
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:47,678
[raven cawing]

424
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,415
 But music doesn't always
 have to start out scary.

425
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,619
The right context
can make even the happiest song

426
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,522
absolutely terrifying.

427
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:06,630
[dissonant version of
"Pop Goes the Weasel" playing]

428
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:15,872
[music continues,
girl humming along]

429
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:18,842
[evil laughter]

430
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:22,012
Once a song
has been conditioned
to elicit fear,

431
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,981
the effect can be
extremely strong
and long-lasting.

432
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:29,052
For example, the theme song
from "The Exorcist,"
"Tubular Bells."

433
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:31,621
 Terrifying, right?
 Go listen to it,
 it's scary.

434
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:34,124
 But just a few months
 before the movie came out,

435
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,527
 it was a chart-topping
 pop hit that audiences loved

436
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:40,764
 because it was lighthearted
 and fun.

437
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:43,600
Oh, strawberry. Very good.

438
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,869
But here's the problem
with sound.

439
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,040
Not everyone has been
conditioned to be afraid
of the same sounds or music,

440
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,443
and not everyone can hear--
what about the deaf?

441
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:56,880
Clearly, the scariest thing
possible to everyone

442
00:21:56,881 --> 00:22:00,450
- will not be a sound. 
 - [girl laughs evilly]

443
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:02,819
Take a look at these paintings.

444
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,489
We have a flirty little clown,

445
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,425
an abstract piece,
and a landscape.

446
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,794
Now, these paintings
may seem a little bit strange,

447
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,896
but I wouldn't say
I'm freaked out by them,

448
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:14,965
and I doubt you would either.

449
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,701
But now let me give you
a bit more story--

450
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:21,071
the context behind these items.

451
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:24,107
This picture was painted
by John Wayne Gacy,

452
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:26,877
a serial killer
who tortured, raped,

453
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:30,680
and killed 33 teenager boys
and young men.

454
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:33,950
This was painted
by Chares Manson,

455
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:36,887
the infamous cult leader
who convinced his followers

456
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:40,924
to commit a series of nine
horrific murders in Los Angeles.

457
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:43,493
And this landscape
was painted by...

458
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:45,195
Adolf Hitler.

459
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:48,165
Your thoughts about these items
have probably changed a bit.

460
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,534
Psychologists call
this phenomenon

461
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,869
the "Law of Contagion."

462
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,172
It's our tendency
to imbue objects

463
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,941
with the qualities of the people
they're associated with.

464
00:22:57,942 --> 00:23:00,477
Now, before and after
you heard the story,

465
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:03,146
the items were still made
of the same molecules and atoms,

466
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:05,615
but our minds use context

467
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:08,018
to quickly endow them
with new powers.

468
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,887
Now, these paintings
cannot hurt you,

469
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:14,724
but the fact that the context
allows your amygdala spider

470
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,927
to connect them
to other fears and,

471
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,197
ultimately, through
your innate aversions, to death,

472
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,733
means they take on
a whole new meaning.

473
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:26,636
 The right story and context

474
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:30,507
 can make almost any object,
 person, or place scary.

475
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:33,009
In fact, let me
ask you a question.

476
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:38,782
What is this, behind me?

477
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:40,517
Ah, you know what?

478
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:45,589
This old camper
isn't actually that scary.

479
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,991
Ahh, nuts.

480
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,660
All right, things
are different now,

481
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,529
and I'm starting to feel, yep,

482
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,131
an automatic process
is already happening to my body.

483
00:23:55,132 --> 00:24:00,203
My amygdala now
associates this trailer
with death and danger.

484
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:02,906
What I'm feeling is actually
the same thing that happens

485
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:04,808
when you feel frisson.

486
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:08,211
That's when you're greatly moved
by something profound.

487
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:11,081
 What's happening
 is that my amygdala

488
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,150
 is telling my hypothalamus 
 to tell my adrenal glands

489
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:17,120
 to start pumping adrenaline
 into my bloodstream.

490
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:20,690
 This makes my arrector pili
 muscles contract,

491
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,926
 which makes my hairs stand up.

492
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:26,196
 Now, if my body were covered
 in thick fur like, say a cat,

493
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:29,099
 this would make me look bigger
 and more threatening.

494
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,201
 But of course,
 a long, long time ago,

495
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:33,770
 we humans lost
 a lot of our fur.

496
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,138
 But we didn't lose this reflex,

497
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,741
 which makes it
 a vestigial reflex,

498
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,944
 something we don't need anymore
 but we still have.

499
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:44,814
 It is known as
 the Piloerection Reflex

500
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:49,119
or, more commonly,
goosebumps.

501
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,890
 Anything that's different
 or abnormal can be scary.

502
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:56,593
Take it, Georgie.

503
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:58,061
[Michael]
 Like Pennywise in "It,"

504
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:00,630
 oftentimes the scariest
 type of predator

505
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:02,599
 isn't a human, a creature,
 or a beast,

506
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,835
 it's a variation
 of a human being...

507
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:07,671
[growling]

508
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,207
 ...a distorted human form
 that looks, acts,

509
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:14,778
 or even moves in
 a disturbingly unnatural way.

510
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,313
Oh, my God.

511
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:19,849
One thing many of us
are terrified by

512
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,918
is a distorted human form.

513
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,186
Why?

514
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:25,221
Our brain and our mind

515
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:27,123
is a kind of
prediction processor.

516
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:29,125
We're trying to predict
what's gonna happen next.

517
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,861
So when anything comes in
and it doesn't match
our template,

518
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:33,697
or sense of categories,

519
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,967
then we're cognitively
and emotionally aroused.

520
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,036
So it activates the amygdala,
it makes us a little suspicious

521
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:41,905
or at least puts us
on our toes again.

522
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:44,908
We have a genetic predisposition

523
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:48,678
to be averse to,
or at least aroused by,

524
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,348
that which is outside
the ordinary.

525
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,683
But when you're fresh
out of the womb,

526
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:57,721
you don't know what's normal
or what's distorted and scary.

527
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,757
Researchers are Princeton
and Florida Atlantic University

528
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,793
demonstrated this
by showing normal faces

529
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:07,931
and creepy, distorted faces...
to babies.

530
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:10,133
 Children that were at least
 one year old

531
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:13,203
 avoided looking
 at the scary faces,
 which makes sense.

532
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,038
 But younger children,

533
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,807
 like those who were
 only eight months old, didn't.

534
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:19,876
 The hypothesis is
 that at that age,

535
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:23,246
 normal hasn't yet been
 sufficiently established.

536
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:26,316
 A creepy face is just
 another thing to look at.

537
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:30,387
It only becomes creepy
when you've been around
long enough to know

538
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,255
what's not creepy.

539
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,991
So when it comes
to finding the one thing

540
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:38,762
that can panic anyone,
I'll need to look elsewhere.

541
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,197
Because if a newborn baby
rolls in here,

542
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:42,999
I won't be able to scare it

543
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,806
even with the most vile,
scary, unnatural face.

544
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:52,008
Of course,
it's not just faces.

545
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:55,111
Distorted natural forms
also include bodies,

546
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:58,214
like humans
with other animal parts.

547
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:02,152
[creature growling]

548
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:07,057
Or creatures moving unnaturally.

549
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:12,896
Oh, my.

550
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,098
 Oh, my.

551
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:16,766
Hoo hoo hoo!

552
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:19,069
"Oh, my," indeed.

553
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,171
You know what's going on here,

554
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,740
this is the third origin.

555
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:26,843
Fears can be born through
firsthand experiences,

556
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:28,445
like feeling pain,

557
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,247
or informationally,
through stories,

558
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:34,818
but we can also learn fear
vicariously

559
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,088
by watching others
experience fear.

560
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,124
[Michael] It's called
 Social Fear Transmission,

561
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,494
 and we tried it out out
 during my fear conditioning
 demonstration.

562
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:48,732
 Our unknowing subject was
 my good friend Alie Ward.

563
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,201
 Alie was invited to observe
 my experience

564
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,369
 and witness my reactions.

565
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,905
- [electricity crackling,
recorded scream]
- [Michael] Jeez!

566
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:59,943
Okay, little bit more scared
of the square right now.

567
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,778
[Michael]
 Right after my test,

568
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:04,047
 it was her turn to face
 the green circle

569
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:05,915
 and the purple square

570
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:09,285
 that appeared
 whenever I got shocked.

571
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,955
[Dr. Zbozinek]
We're gonna use the same
shock intensity

572
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,456
- that Michael had.
- Okay.

573
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:15,925
[Michael]
 Except, that wasn't true.

574
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:19,963
 Alie's test would not
 include any shocks
 or startling sounds.

575
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:23,767
[Alie] Is it normal to be
shaking before this? [laughs]

576
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:27,070
Yeah, it's an anxiety-provoking
task. Are you feeling okay

577
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:29,506
- about doing it?
- Mmm-hmm. Sure.

578
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,775
[Michael]
 Would Alie be afraid
 of the purple square

579
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,277
 just from observing
 my fear of it?

580
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,212
- You ready, Alie?
- Mmm-hmm.

581
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:48,825
All righty, here we go.

582
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:51,227
I feel like I'm gonna barf.

583
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:53,563
[Michael]
 Alie already seems scared.

584
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:56,466
 But is she just
 afraid in general?

585
00:28:56,467 --> 00:29:00,336
 Or is she more afraid
 of the purple square?

586
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:14,184
 Which shape
 is making her sweat the most?

587
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,952
- That's it?
- You're all done.

588
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:18,521
The shock fairy
did not come to visit me?

589
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:20,857
The shock fairy did not
come to visit you.

590
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:24,060
[laughing]
So much adrenaline
for no pain.

591
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:29,098
My hands are sweating so much
that the dye on my pants
is, like, on my hands now.

592
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:33,436
[Michael]
 So which shape
 scared Alie more?

593
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:36,139
 Despite receiving
 no adverse stimuli,

594
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,474
 but after observing my fear,

595
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:41,511
 she had a higher
 physiological response
 to the purple square

596
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,046
 than the green circle.

597
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,547
You were definitely
more afraid

598
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:46,516
of that purple square
throughout the experiment.

599
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:48,384
Ahh. You know,
I'm not a gambler,

600
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:50,186
but I think I was thinking,

601
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:52,222
"I haven't gotten shocked yet--
it's coming."

602
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,990
People are always saying
that they learn from me,

603
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:55,358
but it's usually, you know,

604
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,560
math or science
or facts in general.

605
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,562
You learned fear.

606
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,497
I still hate
that purple square.

607
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:02,599
You're welcome.

608
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,303
[laughing]

609
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:10,506
Let's organize
what we've learned so far.

610
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:14,110
Fear is a feeling
that we learn to have

611
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,980
in response to things
our amygdala figures

612
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,182
we would do best to avoid

613
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:22,652
because in one way or another,
they could lead to our demise.

614
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:26,155
Strands of fear-silk
have connected them in some way

615
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:28,224
to possible death.

616
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:31,527
Now, from talking with experts,
in my estimation,

617
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,930
there are eight
unique innate aversions

618
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:37,066
selected to engender panic
in us, by evolution,

619
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:38,501
over millions of years.

620
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:41,337
They come pre-learned
in our DNA,

621
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:44,607
and include pain, isolation,

622
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:46,609
the unknown or abnormal,

623
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,479
disease, sudden movement,

624
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,981
suffocation, falling,

625
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:54,317
and incapacitation.

626
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:58,254
These form the inner ring
of the web of fear.

627
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:02,292
All our fears,
from rats to radiation,

628
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:06,195
are based on connections
made by our amygdalae to death

629
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:09,432
through one or more
of these innate aversions.

630
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,534
When it comes to learned fears,

631
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:14,671
there may be no limit
to the number we can acquire.

632
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,707
As long as your amygdala
keeps spinning its threads,

633
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,310
the web can extend forever.

634
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,378
But here's what's even cooler:

635
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:25,581
when our learned fears
are combined just right,

636
00:31:25,582 --> 00:31:28,985
they can be scarier
than the sum of their parts.

637
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:31,254
Researchers have found
that if you've been conditioned

638
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:32,956
to fear two separate stimuli,

639
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,725
say, a purple square
and a green circle,

640
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:39,595
seeing them suddenly together
makes you expect a worse outcome

641
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:42,498
than seeing either stimulus
individually.

642
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:45,134
- [Sidney screams]
- Horror filmmakers

643
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,203
 take advantage
 of this phenomenon

644
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:48,604
 by employing a technique

645
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:51,341
 called
 Category Jamming,

646
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,444
 mashing several
 categories of
 fears together

647
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,480
 to create
 the scariest
 villains possible.

648
00:31:57,481 --> 00:32:00,683
[Dr. Asma] There's people
 like Freddy Kreuger,

649
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:04,120
where you've got many things
that indicate death and fear,

650
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:06,522
 like, you know,
 the mottled flesh of his skin,

651
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:09,092
 the burn, he's a ghost,

652
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,627
 his hands are blades
 of some kind.

653
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:13,663
 You're weaving together
 a number

654
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:17,200
 of very fearful associations
 that most people have.

655
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,569
 - And his criminal past.
 - Right. All that together.

656
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,304
 Exactly.

657
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:23,740
[squishy sounds,
whiplash sounds]

658
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:27,443
If you look at, sort of,
the Alien franchise, you'll
see that the face hugger

659
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:32,448
 that grabs onto your
 face is a beautiful hybrid
 of a spider and a snake.

660
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:35,151
 Those are two things
 that are universally feared,

661
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:37,420
 and so this is
 a kind of category jamming.

662
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:39,355
 It doesn't fit in
 our categories.

663
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:41,491
The designers
basically put them together

664
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,560
so the fear
is amplified tremendously.

665
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:47,397
Another example could be
just taking something

666
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,333
that ordinarily
would never be here
and putting it there.

667
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,535
If you put snakes
on a plane,

668
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:55,071
 you've got something
 most people are afraid of--
 snakes--

669
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:57,073
 you've got flying,
 which people are afraid of.

670
00:32:57,074 --> 00:32:58,808
 You've also got
 strange domain crossing.

671
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,711
Why would snakes be on a plane?
That doesn't make sense.

672
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:04,047
And that's unsettling
in and of itself.

673
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,418
So you're weaving together
a number of very fearful
associations

674
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:13,356
that most people have,
and that's uniquely disturbing,
I think.

675
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:16,759
So maybe extreme 
category jamming,

676
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,197
combining every
innate aversion
and conditioned fear,

677
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:24,600
could be the scariest thing.

678
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:29,272
It would certainly be likely to
catch anyone in a web of fear.

679
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,507
Let's try it out.

680
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:34,710
Now, conveniently,
I'm already in a graveyard,

681
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:39,348
so we already have
the fear of death, decay...

682
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:40,550
 [church bells tolling]

683
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:44,320
...it's dark, I'm alone.

684
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:47,590
Let's add in
some scary sounds...

685
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:49,459
 [wolf howling]

686
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,527
[growling]

687
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:54,197
...a distorted human form,

688
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,733
sudden movement...

689
00:33:57,734 --> 00:34:02,705
a mortal threat...

690
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:04,440
gore...

691
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:07,477
[creature growling]

692
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,812
story and context...

693
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:14,484
[growling]

694
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,154
[growls]

695
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,723
...incapacitation.

696
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:21,791
Is this it?

697
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,892
Is the scariest thing possible

698
00:34:23,893 --> 00:34:27,129
just a combination
of every innate aversion

699
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,265
and conditioned fear?

700
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:31,200
[laughing]

701
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:33,236
Oh, dear, Michael.

702
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,472
Conditioned fears
know no bounds.

703
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:39,876
So the scariest thing
is that the human mind

704
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,312
can be made afraid of anything!

705
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:45,247
[laughs evilly]

706
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:48,216
No! Noooo!

707
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:49,619
[Michael 3] 
 Hold it!

708
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,454
Both of you, stop. Just--

709
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:53,356
Let's take a step back.

710
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:57,193
Category jamming together
every possible learned fear

711
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:59,562
and every innate aversion

712
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:01,330
just sounds like a cop-out.

713
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:04,767
I don't like that.
I want to be more specific.

714
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:07,737
But this idea that
the scariest thing

715
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,739
is the fact that
the human mind

716
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,841
can be made afraid
of anything--

717
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:14,210
I don't like that, either.

718
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:18,314
I mean, it might be
the scariest thing possible...

719
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:20,750
but it also might not.

720
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,854
What about people
who don't have an amygdala?

721
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:27,790
Meet Patient SM.

722
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,626
 Not the snake, the hands.

723
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:33,429
 This is all we are allowed
 to show you. 

724
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,199
 Her amygdala was destroyed
 at the age of ten

725
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,568
 due to an incredibly rare
 genetic disorder.

726
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,736
And because she doesn't
have an amygdala,

727
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:44,473
she cannot learn to register
experiences as threats,

728
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:46,776
which puts her life in danger,

729
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,412
and that's why
we can't reveal her identity.

730
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,548
Patient SM's feelings,
the feeling states,

731
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:56,319
her subjective states,
seem to be absent in Patient SM.

732
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,255
For example,
when she was walking
through a park one night,

733
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:01,791
a guy came up to her
and put a knife to her throat,

734
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,693
saying, "Give me your money."

735
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,494
And she just kind
of ignored them and said,

736
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:09,265
"Well, if you cut me,
I'll chase you down
and kill you."

737
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:11,000
She was just
 all rational.

738
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,936
Yeah, yeah.
And she apparently
kind of knows

739
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:16,272
that this isn't right,

740
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:19,642
but she reacts
in a different way.

741
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:21,911
Researchers have even
purposefully exposed her

742
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:24,981
to classically scary things,
like spiders and snakes

743
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,616
and haunted houses
and horror films,

744
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,884
and she has exhibited
no fear response

745
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:31,487
to any of them whatsoever.

746
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:35,625
For a long time, scientists
considered SM living proof

747
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,495
that without an amygdala,
we are unable to feel fear.

748
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:40,830
But then...

749
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,367
one experiment
changed everything.

750
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,736
Scientists have known
for decades

751
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:50,273
that a lack of oxygen
will make you feel dizzy,

752
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:54,343
and maybe even euphoric,
before you pass out.

753
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:58,047
But elevated levels
of carbon dioxide in the blood

754
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,884
induce fear, anxiety, and panic.

755
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:07,523
Patient SM volunteered
to inhale concentrated CO2.

756
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:11,861
Her brain interpreted
the elevated levels of CO2
in her blood

757
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,996
as proof that
she was suffocating,

758
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:17,667
 a process
 we are innately averse to.

759
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:22,805
 As usual, the researchers
 expected SM to feel no fear.

760
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:25,608
But for the first time
in her adult life,

761
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:31,013
 she felt sheer and utter panic.

762
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:33,716
The great thing
about that study on SM

763
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:35,451
is really it was the first time

764
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:38,387
that we showed that
these emotional responses

765
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:39,889
can occur without an amygdala.

766
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,091
Over the course
of the next year,

767
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:45,428
the scientists tracked down
two rare patients in Germany

768
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,331
who also had
non-functioning amygdalae

769
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,634
and gave them the same
CO2 inhalation test.

770
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,869
They had
the same panic response.

771
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,805
 Researchers believe

772
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,574
 that the fight-or-flight
 responses they observed

773
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:00,509
 in these amygdala-damaged
 patients

774
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,346
 were induced by
 CO2-sensing neurons

775
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,982
 in evolutionarily older regions
 of the brain,

776
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:10,353
 like the midbrain
 or even the brain stem,

777
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,622
 which control more primal
 physiological functions.

778
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:16,759
 And so if I want to terrify

779
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,929
even the neurologically
un-scare-able,

780
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,699
I need our body's
internal fear response

781
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,436
to elevated carbon dioxide
levels in the blood.

782
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:29,638
But the story doesn't end there.

783
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:33,042
SM's researchers
later discovered
something even weirder.

784
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:37,580
 When a control group
 of people with functioning
 amygdalae inhaled CO2,

785
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,816
 they showed a lower
 fear reaction than Patient SM.

786
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:45,421
Why? Well, this question
led to a potentially
revolutionary rethinking

787
00:38:45,422 --> 00:38:47,556
of the amygdala's role in fear.

788
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:51,394
Researches still believe
that the amygdala learns
to detect threats

789
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,496
 that are outside the body

790
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,464
 so that the body
 can respond to them,

791
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:57,967
 but when it comes
 to internal threats,

792
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:02,438
 it may actually inhibit
 your fear response.

793
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:05,040
 The control subjects
 knew they were participating

794
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,810
 in a safe,
 voluntary experiment,

795
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:11,447
 so their amygdalae
 may have effectively told
 other parts of their brain,

796
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,883
"Hey, relax.
Things are bad in the body,

797
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:17,119
"but I don't detect
a real external threat,
so, like, calm down.

798
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,156
A panic response
isn't gonna help;
not warranted."

799
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:25,928
So if you want to ensure
the utmost amount of panic
in the most people,

800
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:28,030
you don't need to category jam

801
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:31,867
every possible scary
and unpleasant thing together,

802
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:33,903
you only need two of them.

803
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,039
Increase a person's
blood CO2 levels

804
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,076
and present an external threat
they'll believe is causing it.

805
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:43,612
Drowning. Waterboarding.

806
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:45,581
Coerced CO2 inhalation.

807
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:51,554
They're all variations
of the one true scariest thing:

808
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,057
 elevation of carbon dioxide
 in the blood

809
00:39:55,058 --> 00:40:00,095
 caused by an uncontrollable
 external threat.

810
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:01,497
