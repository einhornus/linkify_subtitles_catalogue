1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,479
Wait, hold on a second.
I have a tail?

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,099
Whoa!
And how many red dots

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,009
can you count?
Look close. It's episode 50

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,528
of IMG!
Static electricity and packaging peanuts are always fun

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:17,259
together,

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,499
so is the creation of atom,
even though cats and dogs can do it too.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,259
Oh, and this giraffe is having a fun
time, because he's being

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,839
kissed by a giraffe.
Peek-a-boo.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,519
Peek-a-boo.
The only thing more delicious than a hamburger

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,729
eye makeup are Vsauce nails.
And,

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,839
if you walk around with your lips
puckered, from certain perspectives this

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,288
will happen. And is this a guy with no neck
wearing a purple shirt or is it...

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,619
wait, what? Now, this picture exhibits a
similar illusion. Get it?

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,038
It's just like this girl with a hairy
arm that I showed in a previous IMG!

15
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,339
Now, speaking of hair, here are some
wonderfully rigid structures

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,419
drawn

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,898
with hair-thin thread.
Even Chewbacca

18
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,339
is hair. And here's a pretty scene that
from far away or with your eyes squinted

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,779
looks like a skull.
Aww, a cute duck.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,359
Gosh, dang it.
Short of the Week illustrated something

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,629
interesting.
The top 10 grossing films over periods of

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,399
10 years.
Blue titles are original ideas,

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,019
gray represents adaptations and pink represents

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,939
sequels.
Now, watch what happened as time went on.

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,199
In 2011, there wasn't a single

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,019
original movie idea in the top 10.
Tetris tights.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,629
Now, let's watch a bunch of dogs

28
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:53,109
wearing shoes.

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,319
Here's a transformer who becomes a Game Boy.

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,658
And if your chin folds,
combined with your forehead creases

31
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,989
you wind up like this.
Draw bridge? Okay, if you say so.

32
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,719
And if you want to see a visualization
of the last 100 years

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,999
of shark attacks,
the National Post has this mammoth,

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,229
showing where in the world and where on the
body people became victims.

35
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,789
On Facebook, Kess warned us about the very serious

36
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,759
issue of drowning. LOL. And Leonardo showed us crayons carved into Star Wars shapes.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,089
But you won't get lost with this giant
comprehensive math

38
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,458
of the entire Star Wars galaxy.
If you'd rather map something

39
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,919
fewer light years across,
check out this site, where you can see a map of the

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,879
wind, its patterns, as it invisibly tangles itself

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,068
across the USA.
Geographies of the World's Knowledge is a free booklet

42
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,719
available as a PDF or an iPad book and it shows

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,839
the distribution of knowledge in the
Internet age. The size of each country

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,559
is relative to number of people in it

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,179
who have access to Internet.
Its redness

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,279
is equal to the percentage.
And this map

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,909
shows the distribution of heavy metal
bands from around the world.

48
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,129
Now look at this from a distance and you will see

49
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,768
yourself. With most Vsauce videos end it's
like the end of a schools zone,

50
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,119
but when IMG number 50 is over,
it's the end of a

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,519
cool zone.
So, kitty, turn off the lights, because

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,379
as always,

53
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,380
thanks for watching.
