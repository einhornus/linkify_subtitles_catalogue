1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,048
Wrap a hot dog in a burger and share one
with the girl who looks like Taylor

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:04,669
Lautner.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,959
It's episode 35 of IMG!

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,999
Okay, see this picture

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,899
of Albert Einstein?
Well, squint your eyes to see a wizard.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,159
Last week a volcano erupted in Iceland
and it was captured

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,059
from space.
Octopus chandeliers are also weird,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,789
but this is how I spend most of my
Saturdays. Once the kid is born,

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,739
pick up a TV dinner,
perfect for kid...bullying people.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,718
I usually prefer meals like this,
complete with snails

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,519
and romance. Rage faces are everywhere,
but take a look at a dollar bill.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,739
Closer, closer, closer,

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,879
closer. Forever alone.
Grandma...

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,029
Oh.
Here's a pilot ejecting from a plane

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,779
really close to the ground.
This is what he escaped from.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,119
No, no, no, kitty, kitty, kitty.
That is a bad box to sleep in.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,869
But I do love epic meetings.
Carl Sagan

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,558
and the Dalai Lama. George Harrison and
Bob Marley. Warren Buffett,

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,578
Bill Gates, Ludacris.
Hunter S Thompson,

20
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,849
John Cusack, Johnny Depp and a blow up doll.

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,249
Oh, and this guy with Albert Einstein,
that is Charlie Chaplin and here's

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,839
Chaplin

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,599
with Gandhi.
Oh and when bears are bald, they look like

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,939
this.
Artist Sam Spratt gave us Dwight Schrute

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,728
wearing a bear,
and he also created Rebecca Black

26
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:30,649
with rotting flesh.
Reddit discovered a lot

27
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,469
of truths this week. A building that looks
like a bird wearing a top hat

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,969
and Obama looks like this.
Seriously.

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,109
A lot.
And now, funny names for boats.

30
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:57,579
Enjoy.

31
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,189
This license

32
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,489
plate looks random, but in a mere
reflection... Potatoes and humans can be

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,239
friends.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,869
And if you want a wedding ring to be
more permanent, make it a piercing.

35
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,839
Sam Bassett takes incredible portraits.
Randy Moss,

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,619
rainbows, tennis. And here are some books
from the Dutch literature organization

37
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,119
cut into three-dimensional heads,
like this one of Anne Frank.

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,809
And that's right, you guessed it,
today's final image

39
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,809
is this 8-bit hair bow that you can own

40
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,039
from today's episode of LÃœT, where I cover a bunch of
stuff that you can actually buy.

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,059
And don't worry boys, there are some gifts
for you, too. So go over there right now,

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,279
click on the hair bow to view it.
