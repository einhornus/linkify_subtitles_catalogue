Vsauce.
Michael here with good news. Today we've got

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,639
two Leanback experiences, where we pull together great

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,949
videos from people all over YouTube.
The first, here on Vsauce with me,

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,939
is roughly gonna be about complexity.
But over on Vsauce2

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,079
Kevin has put together an exhibition of fantastic

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,839
street art.
To begin, all you have to do is click the link

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,938
at the very top of this video's
description. And to start Kevin's Leanback

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,268
go over to Vsauce2.

9
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:31,409
Click the link whenever you're ready,
but in the meantime,

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,529
let me show you this.
It was submitted by a

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,679
fan named Aaron and it shows the cast of
The Key of Awesome.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,819
But wait, who's this hot body with great cleavage?

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,279
You guessed it, the bearded nun.
Aaron, this is gonna be

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:53,149
on my refrigerator for the rest of my life.
Thank you.

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,469
Are you guys still there?

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,999
Seriously?
Because you should start the Leanback.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,189
Click the link at the top of this video.
I'll see you on the other side.

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,209
And as always,

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,490
thanks for watching.
