00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:03,748
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today I've got a brand new episode

2
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:07,418
of Vsauce Leanback.
You can click this annotation

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,629
or the link at the top of the
description to start it and then you can

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,718
just lean back

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,048
and the autoplay playlist bring the
knowledge right to your brain.

6
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:19,209
As you already know, it doesn't really
work on mobile phones yet so wait until

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,018
you are in a better position to lean back.

8
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,549
In the meantime, let's get saccadic.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,549
No, not psychotic, saccadic,

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,829
referring to what is known as
a saccade, the quick

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,929
movements that our eyeballs make
when we move from one

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,339
object to the other. As you may remember
from a previous Leanback, some animals,

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,449
like most birds,

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,449
cannot move their eyeballs. And so to look
from one thing to another they have to

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,079
move their head really really fast

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,469
and to keep the world from being blurry
when their bodies move, they have to keep

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,659
their heads completely stationary.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,849
But here's the neat thing about saccades.
When our eyes move,

19
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,469
there's a quick blur between

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,389
one destination and the other. And that
blur is completely incomprehensible to

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,999
our brain.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,189
So what are visual system does is erase it

23
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,329
from our memory and instead replace that
little fraction of a second that our eye

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,459
moved during

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,759
with the very next thing we see.
This leads to a really amazing illusion

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,269
called

27
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,859
'The Stopped Clock Illusion."
You may have noticed this before

28
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,809
if you've ever been in a room with a
clock with a second hand, like in a

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,569
classroom,

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,879
darting your eyes back and forth
waiting for class

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,319
to be out. Now here is what happens.
Right when you dart your eyes to the clock,

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,319
that very first second, that very first
movement of the second hand

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,999
that happens when your eyes reach it
seems longer

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,879
than every other second afterwards.
Look away from the clock

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,299
and then look.
And that first second will seem to linger,

36
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,489
as if time itself has stopped.
The reason for that

37
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,329
is that your brain replaces the time
it took for your eye to go from here

38
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,158
to the clock with an image of the
first thing you saw, which was the second-hand.

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,649
And so, that little fraction of a
second of time is added

40
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,618
to length of time it takes the second-hand to
move. What's really mind-blowing about

41
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,228
this entire

42
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,679
effect is that it happens all the time.
All day,

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,309
as you look around the world from one
point to another, that little fraction of

44
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:16,919
a second

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,089
that your eyeball was moving is lost
and your brain just replaces it with the very

46
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,609
next thing

47
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,109
that you see. Now, it might just be
a tiny tiny amount of time,

48
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,189
but over the course of an entire day
those little fraction of a second

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,249
add up to almost 40 minutes.

50
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,769
40 minutes of everyday that you're awake
are lost

51
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,659
because our eyeballs move.

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,919
And as always,

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,119
thanks for watching.

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,299
So what are you waiting for,

55
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,779
click here to start the Leanback or click
the link at the top of this

56
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,229
video's description.
You know what? I totally

57
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,150
never say this... Yeah, I'm totally heterosexual, but..
You are really attractive!
