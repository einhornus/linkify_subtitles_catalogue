1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,729
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Our atmosphere

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,298
is a thin vail of air, held to earth's surface

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,289
by gravity.
We live in it, we breathe it, we walk through it

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,319
every day; it contains all weather, but yet

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,948
it is almost nothing.
In fact,

6
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:24,089
if the earth was the size of an apple
our atmosphere from the ground all

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,618
the way to outer space

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,089
would only be about as thick

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,009
as the skin of an apple.
And because our atmosphere gets

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,738
thinner, exponentially as you go up,
90 percent of our atmospheres mass

11
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,539
at this scale could fit within a space
as thin as just a

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,429
third of an apple's skin.
But that shrimpy sliver of a peel

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,538
would still be thousands of times
thicker than you are tall.

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,709
We humans are itsy bitsy dots

15
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,049
strolling around in a skinny sky.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,929
But that skinny sky does a lot.
Think about this.

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,419
What if I had a really awesome big straw

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,539
and I stuck one end in the ocean and the other end out

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,389
in space.
Would outer space be able to suck

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,599
all the water out?
We know that

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,019
naked exposed veneer vacuum of space

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,129
all non concealed gases in your body

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,139
would be violently farted and burped

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,749
out. Sucked out.

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,158
But sucking is not attractive.

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,779
Instead, sucking merely refers to a flow

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,519
from a region of higher pressure to a
region of lower pressure.

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,499
In other words, a vacuum cleaner in and
of itself does not

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,849
attract matter to itself.
Like I said in my video

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,908
with no title, if you were to turn on a vacuum cleaner

31
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,559
at sea level,
a region inside the cleaner becomes as

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,978
thin as air in Denver, Colorado.
External

33
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:01,569
air, which is at a greater pressure,
is then literally pushed

34
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,078
by its own greater pressure into the machine, bringing

35
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,817
dust and debris with it.
The point is,

36
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,109
the strength of the force pushing air
into a vacuum cleaner

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,559
can only be as strong as the pressure

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,759
of the surrounding air.
Here on earth,

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,068
using a vacuum cleaner or even a space straw,
that pressure is

40
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,639
atmospheric pressure.
At sea level about 15 pounds per square inch

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,958
or 65.4 Newton's.
That amount of force can

42
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,159
only push pure water up about 10.3 meters

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,249
or 33.9 feet.
Because outer space

44
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,369
is not 10 meters up,
it's more like 100,000 meters up,

45
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,049
a space straw would be a terrible
doomsday device for a super villain to

46
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,759
use to get rid of our oceans.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,799
Our atmosphere just isn't heavy or strong enough

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,818
to push water into orbit.
Because the weight

49
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,799
of air above, pushing molecules below in
all directions is responsible for

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,789
air pressure, air lowered down exerts

51
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,529
more pressure. The air at your feet
pushes with a slightly greater force

52
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:13,949
than the

53
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,549
air at your head. Now, across the human
body, you can't tell the difference.

54
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,229
But if an object is light enough,
it can be affected by this difference,

55
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,249
which is why a helium balloon floats.

56
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,708
The air down here pushes a tiny bit more
strongly than the air up here,

57
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,419
and since the balloon is lighter than
the same volume of air, it's literally

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,439
pushed up

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,679
by the air more strongly than gravity pulls it down.

60
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,869
This upward force, caused by a surrounding fluid

61
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,289
or gas that counteracts an object's weight,

62
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,048
is known as buoyancy.
Now, here on the surface of the earth,

63
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,048
the buoyancy of air isn't enough to
cause humans to float away

64
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,988
or be lifted. But it exists.
In fact, in a perfect vacuum,

65
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,619
you would weigh about a fifth of pound
more than you do

66
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,669
right now.
Thanks air! Back to our balloon

67
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,309
friend.
He's not going to float up forever

68
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,199
in the outer space, escaping earth.
Eventually, as the atmosphere thins out,

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,898
and the baloon expands, it will

70
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,078
pop and fall back down to earth,
its helium spreading throughout the atmosphere.

71
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,299
So, besides rockets that we intentionally

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,809
launch off of Earth, does our atmosphere ever

73
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,209
lose anything?
Does earth ever lose anything?

74
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,198
Does Earth ever gain anything?

75
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,239
I mean, I used to be smaller, I used to be a little kid.

76
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,008
But all of the atoms and molecules in my
body right now simply came from things

77
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:43,399
that I

78
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,539
consumed.
Things that I ate or drank or breathed in.

79
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,779
When new kids are born, the earth doesn't get

80
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,519
heavier, because a new baby is just a rearrangement of

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,909
atoms and molecules that used to be inside its mother

82
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,929
or molecules that she ate, drank or breathed in,

83
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,388
all of which came from earth.
Everything's recycled,

84
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,059
so is the earth not gaining or losing mass?

85
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,939
Well to begin, earth does lose some stuff.

86
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,119
For instance, hydrogen and helium are a bit too light

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,149
to stick around because of earth's
gravity. They eventually fly out into

88
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,079
space or get picked off by solar wind

89
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,619
at the edge of our atmosphere,
which is why, as I've said before,

90
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,638
we are likely to one day run out

91
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,899
of helium. Pretty soon.

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,138
But the earth gains mass in some ways as well.
For instance,

93
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,869
every year it's been estimated that 10 to 20

94
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,279
million kilograms of space dust
and meteorite fragments fall to Earth,

95
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,519
making it heavier. Now, if you factor in
the energy that the earth radiates away,

96
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,668
which is equivalent to mass, as well as
the energy the earth gets from the Sun

97
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,109
and holds onto, for instance,
using its greenhouse gases,

98
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,459
in total it has been calculated that every

99
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,698
year earth becomes 50 million kilograms

100
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,008
lighter.
That might sound like a lot,

101
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:16,538
but it is only 0.00 0000 0000 0000

102
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:19,769
1 percent of Earth's total mass,

103
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,879
which means that for all intents and
purposes, the stuff that we are made of,

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,668
the atoms and molecules in our bodies,
the food that we eat, the water that we drink, our

105
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:29,809
best friends,

106
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,149
has all been here since the early days

107
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,448
of Earth, including the air that you are breathing

108
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:42,379
right now.
Remember that six trillion
kilograms of oxygen that all humans

109
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,029
inhale

110
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,719
every year? Well, each and every one of us,
individually contributes by breathing

111
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,709
about 8.5 million times per year.

112
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,288
Here's the thing about a breath.
Because molecules

113
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,888
are so frustratingly small, a single

114
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,939
little breath contains about 10 sextillion

115
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,269
molecules.
In a poetic

116
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,978
twist of symmetry, Earth's entire
atmosphere contains a volume of air

117
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,179
equal to about 10 sextillion

118
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,038
breaths.
The number of molecules in one breath

119
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,469
is equal to the number of breaths our
earth has to give us,

120
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,809
that is assuming, of course, that we never
exhaled anything and it never got renewed,

121
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,978
which it does.

122
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,399
And because our atmosphere gets circulated so quickly

123
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,818
and because we breathe so often and
because molecules are so small,

124
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,219
statistically speaking, our atmosphere

125
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,638
our skinny little peel of air is

126
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,799
crowded with molecules that we've all
had inside our bodies

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,749
and been breathing.

128
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,948
To make this really mind-blowing,
let's focus only

129
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,649
on carbon dioxide.
We don't just breathe it in

130
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,689
and then right back out again.
It's a waste product that comes from all over

131
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,719
our bodies.

132
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,888
And carbon dioxide is useful to plants, which

133
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,049
absorb it and then turn it into sugars.
It doesn't just inertly float around our

134
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,318
atmosphere

135
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,659
forever. Okay.
Well, it has been estimated

136
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,128
that it takes one breath

137
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,258
about 1 year to thoroughly mix
throughout the hemisphere's

138
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,899
of earth and about 10 years to
thoroughly mix within the troposphere

139
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,899
that we live in

140
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,888
and the stratosphere above.
Now, given that only 5 percent of what we

141
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:36,207
exhale is carbon dioxide and only 20 percent of that

142
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,319
came from metabolism within our brain,

143
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,489
even if we assume that 99.99999 percent

144
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,289
of all the  CO2 you have ever exhaled has
been trapped in the oceans or absorbed

145
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,879
by plants

146
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,189
and made into sugars, it is still
mathematically certain,

147
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,979
even if you were in a brand new place
you've never breathed in before,

148
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,939
that every breath you take contains at
least a few molecules that were once

149
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,979
inside your brain.
A few of them

150
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,039
may have been molecules that you used
five years ago to remember where you

151
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,359
left your keys.

152
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,849
A few of them may have been inside your brain

153
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,669
when you first fell in love.
And

154
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,719
a few of them, almost certainly, were inside the brain

155
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,099
of your mother while she was giving birth

156
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,219
to you.
So,

157
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,659
take a deep breath because our air is

158
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,208
crowded with history.
And keep breathing,

159
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,299
because within the next 10 years it is certain that

160
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,449
I will breathe in a few carbon dioxide molecules that are

161
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,469
inside your brain right now, as you listen to me say

162
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,219
that:

163
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,139
As always,

164
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,840
thanks for watching.
