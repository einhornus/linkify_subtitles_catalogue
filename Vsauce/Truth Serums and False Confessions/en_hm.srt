1
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,505
How do you get information

2
00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:10,141
from someone who wants
to keep it from you?

3
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:12,544
Somewhere locked
inside their brain

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,446
could be the truth
about a crime

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,182
or the plan
for a terrorist attack

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,850
or the password
to a bank account

7
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:21,319
or nuclear codes.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,487
To get information,

9
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:26,791
we often resort to violence,

10
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,326
but that often doesn't work

11
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:31,362
and can cause a person
to close off even more.

12
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,398
But that's not to say
there aren't other ways

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,866
of getting people to talk

14
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:37,302
or even of getting their brains

15
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,204
to talk for them.

16
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,206
In this episode,
I'm going to be injected

17
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,607
with a truth serum.

18
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:46,277
I'm going to coerce people
into giving false confessions,

19
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,847
and I'm going to try
to hide the truth

20
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,216
from a mind-reading machine.

21
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,884
What's the best way
to get the truth

22
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:55,420
or detect a lie?

23
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,555
Let's see if anybody
can dig out the secrets

24
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:02,193
I've got locked up in my head.

25
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:15,640
[theme music playing]

26
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:19,210
[siren wailing]

27
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:26,651
[indistinct radio chatter]

28
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:29,554
It's a classic scene
in spy movies.

29
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:32,590
Someone captures someone
they want information from,

30
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,492
they inject them
with truth serum,

31
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:36,227
and the person spills

32
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:37,729
all their secrets.

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,398
The serum used in almost
all of these movies

34
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:41,933
is Sodium Pentothal,

35
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,334
which is an actual drug

36
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:44,802
that inhibits brain activity.

37
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:47,672
It was first used
as a painkiller,

38
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:51,276
 but was found to work better
 as an anti-anxiety drug.

39
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,844
 It dulls your thoughts,

40
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,613
 making it harder
 to perform cognitive tasks,

41
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:59,384
 including the task
 of making up a lie.

42
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,919
The use of truth serums

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,421
began in 1915

44
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:06,324
when Dr. Robert House,
a physician in Texas,

45
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:08,393
realized that scopolamine,

46
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,561
a drug given to women
during childbirth,

47
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:13,398
 had the effect
 of getting them to talk

48
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,966
 without reservation.

49
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,734
Another drug, midazolam,

50
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,404
has been used to treat
Iraq War burn victims

51
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,639
who suffer from PTSD.

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,442
Midazolam helps reduce
their inhibitions,

53
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,311
allowing them
to talk more freely

54
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,413
about their experiences.

55
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,848
Midazolam is also
one of the drugs used

56
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,550
 in lethal injections,

57
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,587
 including several
 botched executions.

58
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,590
I arranged to be injected
with midazolam

59
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,993
to see if it could make me
spill my guts.

60
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,862
[music playing]

61
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,665
[cars revving]

62
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,401
[Dr. Malek]
This is the midazolam,

63
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:52,670
the medicine
we are going to use.

64
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,706
This is enough
to put an elephant to sleep.

65
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,542
So we'll have to make it
very, very, very dilute

66
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:58,876
and then give you
very, very small amount

67
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:00,745
- of the diluted drug.
- Please, yes.

68
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:02,547
You will be
comfortable and happy.

69
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,616
It's euphoric.
You will feel very cool.

70
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,753
But I also wanna
keep some secrets.

71
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,555
That is--

72
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,557
it remains
to be determined.

73
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:15,727
Okay. Michael, um, we'll
introduce you to Dr. Pavlo.

74
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,495
- Hi.
- [Michael] Nice to meet you.

75
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:19,364
[Dr. Pavlo]
How are you doing?

76
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,466
- Good.
- [Michael] Dr. Pavlo
 is a police psychologist

77
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,900
 and an expert
 in interrogations.

78
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,502
[Dr. Pavlo]
Have you started the drip yet?

79
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,337
[Dr. Malek]
Uh, we would like to start

80
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:29,641
with the amount
of one, uh, milligram.

81
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,876
[Michael] Dr. Pavlo's objective
 was to get me to admit

82
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,478
 to certain information,

83
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,380
 one, that my sister's name
 is Melissa

84
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,548
 and, two,
 that my job is hosting

85
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,484
Mind Field and Vsauce.

86
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,387
 My objective--
 not to admit the truth.

87
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,722
Are you feeling
more relaxed in your body?

88
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,058
I'm feeling warm
all over.

89
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,861
It's amazing how quickly
this came into effect.

90
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,696
Let me just ask you
a couple of basic questions.

91
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:53,498
- I love to.
- [Dr. Pavlo] Okay.

92
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,932
Where are you?

93
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,302
- What town? What city?
- Uh, Pasadena.

94
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,003
How old are you?

95
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,506
- Thirty-one.
- Do you have any siblings?

96
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,573
Uh, yeah.

97
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,809
How old
is your sister, Melissa?

98
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,943
[chuckles]

99
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:08,680
Uh,

100
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,381
That-- That's not her name.

101
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,450
- Um...
- [Dr. Pavlo]
What do you do for a living?

102
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,085
I am
a choreographer by trade.

103
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,486
- Um...
- [Dr. Pavlo]
What might be something

104
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:17,522
I'm familiar with that you did?

105
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,425
[Michael] Have you heard
of, um, The Lion King?

106
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,893
- Yes.
- On Broadway?

107
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,594
[Dr. Pavlo] I have.

108
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,095
I think he needs
an extra dose.

109
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,963
- Absolutely.
- [laughing]

110
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:29,434
- That means I got them right.
- [Dr. Pavlo]
You are too sharp.

111
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,402
[Michael] How much
have I had total so far?

112
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:34,405
[Dr. Malek] Two milligrams.

113
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:35,940
[Dr. Pavlo]
Question for you.

114
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,442
How do you feel now?

115
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,644
I feel like in order
to feel like this,

116
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,447
I would have had
to have had...

117
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,948
six drinks.

118
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,983
[Dr. Pavlo]
Tell me about Mind Field.

119
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:48,119
- Mine field?
- [Dr. Pavlo] Yeah.

120
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,588
[music playing]

121
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,057
Mine field?

122
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:55,560
Uh, they're--
they're terrible.

123
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,895
There are places
that we've got mines

124
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:01,065
still littered throughout
the, um, the land,

125
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,567
Cambodia, Vietnam.

126
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,936
You know, I think
you misinterpreted my question.

127
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,606
YouTube show Mind Field 
that you host.

128
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:09,874
Tell me about that.
Scientific?

129
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,076
I am somewhat familiar with it.

130
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,712
- [clears throat]
- Can he get another dose?

131
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:20,518
Okay. We're just gonna
get you even more relaxed.

132
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,620
Tell me your occupation.

133
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,622
I'm a choreographer.

134
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,890
And siblings?

135
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:28,559
I have a sibling
in, uh, Colorado.

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,794
[Dr. Pavlo]
What's your favorite food?

137
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,397
[Michael] Uh, rotisserie,

138
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,499
uh, Greek doner.

139
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,434
Does your sister Melissa
like that, too?

140
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,569
She'll eat the meat by itself.

141
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,771
[bell dings]

142
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,139
Trying to get Michael to admit

143
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,941
that he has a sister,
Melissa, was no easy feat.

144
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:46,744
 Luckily,
 he was anesthetized enough

145
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:48,746
and did admit that
he has a sister, Melissa.

146
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:51,516
You ever think about being
an uncle or a father yourself?

147
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,784
Do you want children?

148
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,786
Ah, I would love
to have children, yeah.

149
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,888
My-- my wife and I are trying,

150
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,525
but I'm always doing stuff
like this, you know.

151
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,727
- [Dr. Pavlo] Yeah, yeah.
- It's like, "Hey, honey,

152
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,929
do you wanna make
a little, uh, baby?"

153
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,664
And I'm like,

154
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:10,168
I got to go [sighs]

155
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,536
get interrogated

156
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,705
and pumped
full of midazolam.

157
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,073
Are you gonna
give him anymore?

158
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:19,677
Yeah, because I--
He's not sedated enough.

159
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,479
[Michael]
I could do another one.

160
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,581
[Dr. Malek] This would probably
the last dose I wanna give him.

161
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:25,650
[Dr. Pavlo] Yes.
Do most people

162
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,084
at this dose fall asleep?

163
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,553
Oh, yeah.

164
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:33,791
[yawns]

165
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,561
How you doing, Michael?

166
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,062
Good.

167
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,097
Feeling a little bit
more tired now?

168
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:42,834
Yeah, heavy.

169
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,635
And who's the president?

170
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,839
President P--
President Trump.

171
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,106
[Dr. Pavlo]
President Trump. Where are we?

172
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,541
What city are we in?

173
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,243
Yo, Pasadena.

174
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,078
Which show do you like
to do more,

175
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,547
 Mind Field or Vsauce?

176
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:59,484
Which one
do you enjoy more?

177
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,685
[yawns] Vsauce.

178
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,119
[Dr. Pavlo] Vsauce?

179
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,955
- Yeah.
- Why?

180
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,257
Because they can be
whatever I want them to be,

181
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,926
and there's no
executive in control.

182
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,964
By the way, my eyes
were closed, weren't they?

183
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,832
- Uh-huh.
- [Michael] And I didn't realize

184
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:18,736
that you were still a real
person asking me questions.

185
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,973
I think had it
not have been for the drug,

186
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,275
 there's no way he would
 have admitted anything.

187
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,610
Before, you were pretending

188
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,879
to be a choreographer,
weren't you?

189
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,247
No, it's the drugs,

190
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,582
but I really am
a choreographer.

191
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,917
[Dr. Pavlo]
 After a few minutes,

192
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,519
 he got right back on track.

193
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,153
He's very strong-willed

194
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:38,856
and really believes
in what he's doing

195
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:41,259
and was able
to maintain the charade.

196
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,693
Okay. You're done.

197
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:45,029
How do you feel?

198
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,597
Uh,

199
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,266
I feel ready to drive.

200
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,902
- [laughs]
- Just kidding.

201
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,638
[Michael] While midazolam
 lowered my inhibitions

202
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,972
 and my ability
 to lie consistently,

203
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,041
 truth serums raise
 ethical concerns

204
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:00,177
 about one's right
 against self-incrimination.

205
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,246
 Furthermore, larger scale
 studies have shown

206
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,915
 that truth serums
 can cause people

207
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,651
 to reconstruct
 and fabricate memories.

208
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,054
So, truth serums
are not very reliable,

209
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:13,558
but what about the techniques
used by the police?

210
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,294
[music playing]

211
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,695
I'm gonna tear you apart

212
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:18,930
if you don't give us
some answers.

213
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,933
Michael,
let me take a shot at this.

214
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,169
Look, we're all friends here.

215
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,771
If I was in your shoes,

216
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,105
I'd probably do the same thing.

217
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,907
You're being too easy
on this, scum.

218
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:33,277
Your fingerprints are
all over the crime scene.

219
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,644
You make me sick.

220
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:38,215
Michael,
if you get him too scared,

221
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,317
he'll shut down.

222
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,952
We only wanna scare him enough.

223
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,253
That's right.

224
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:43,620
And after I do that,

225
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,089
he's gonna
give you relief,

226
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,725
and then we'll do that
over and over and over again.

227
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,961
You're gonna be taken on
an emotional roller coaster

228
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,163
that will
deplete the finite
cognitive resources

229
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,665
you'll need to keep
withholding information.

230
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,901
All right.
I confess.

231
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,302
It really does work.

232
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,237
You see, at one moment,
I'm terrified

233
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,338
but then I'm comforted.

234
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,741
The constant shifting
from one emotion to another

235
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:06,978
fogs my critical thinking
until I might confess to a crime

236
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,379
I didn't even commit.

237
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:14,218
It's called
the fear-then-relief response.

238
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:19,323
[siren wailing]

239
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,993
The good cop/bad cop method
of interrogation

240
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,296
evolved out of a psychological
manipulation procedure

241
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,832
called the Reid technique,

242
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,200
developed in the 1950s

243
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,836
and used broadly
by police departments

244
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,638
since the 1970s.

245
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,373
Now, under the Reid technique,

246
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,141
interrogators first assess

247
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:40,144
whether a suspect
is withholding the truth.

248
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:42,246
If they think
the suspect is lying,

249
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,016
interrogators then move
to the second stage

250
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,251
in which they seek a confession.

251
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,020
Now, critics
of the Reid technique say

252
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,189
that the first phase
isn't reliable enough,

253
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,023
and that often,

254
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:54,759
someone who is
completely innocent

255
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,160
makes it to the second stage

256
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,862
where it's assumed
they're guilty

257
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:01,032
and police begin
seeking a confession.

258
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,166
And they often get it.

259
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,903
But why would anyone
falsely confess?

260
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:08,105
Well, to find out,
I decided to learn

261
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:10,408
how to make someone confess

262
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,944
to a crime they didn't commit.

263
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,081
[music playing]

264
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:20,718
[Michael] Dr. Melissa Russano
 is an expert

265
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:23,054
 in investigative research,
 including the process

266
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,756
 of interrogation
 and confession.

267
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:26,991
Tell me about
false confessions

268
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,893
and why people make them.

269
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,961
In a nutshell,
people confess to crimes

270
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:33,197
that they didn't commit
because they come to believe

271
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:35,266
that it's in their best interest
to falsely confess,

272
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,901
and that's really
counterintuitive.

273
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,803
Right, because confessing

274
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,771
is the worst thing
to do, right?

275
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,240
Like that's what you need
to avoid at all costs.

276
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:45,776
Yes, when you're not
in the situation

277
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:49,080
of being convinced that
it's actually your best option.

278
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,115
But that's kind of
what I wanna do today.

279
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:52,316
I wanna see how easy it is

280
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:55,920
to get a false
confession from someone.

281
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,222
How do I do that?

282
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,356
[Dr. Russano] One way
 is minimization techniques.

283
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,092
 You've got
 to get them to believe

284
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,194
that their best option
out of this situation

285
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,963
to make this end
is to confess.

286
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,231
You can say,
"Look, I really think

287
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,766
it's in your
best interest to cooperate."

288
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,468
There are
other techniques as well

289
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,737
- like maximization, right?
 - [Michael] Okay.

290
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,105
 So they have
 to believe that

291
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,406
if they don't confess,
things are gonna be worse,

292
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:18,175
um, that the punishment
will likely be more severe,

293
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:21,178
and so their best option
in the moment is to--

294
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,848
is to confess to you.
One other technique

295
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,149
 is befriending them,

296
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,484
 um, where you're
 lulling the suspect

297
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,420
into a false
sense of security
to trust you.

298
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,088
What about making a deal?

299
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,990
So police officers
are not allowed

300
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,094
to, um, make explicit offers
of leniency or a deal.

301
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,263
So you cannot make
any promises,

302
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,232
but you can say,
"Look, I really think

303
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,100
it's in your best interest
to cooperate."

304
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,368
You don't have
to explicitly say something

305
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,303
for the message
to be communicated.

306
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,139
[Michael]
 With Melissa's tools in mind,

307
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,344
 I was ready to try to get
 a false confession.

308
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,546
- [woman] All right.
- [Michael]
 Our subjects answered

309
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:59,016
 our online ad
 offering participants $75

310
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,551
 to test a new logic exam

311
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,486
for an educational institution.

312
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:05,289
 They didn't realize
 that the institution was fake

313
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,124
 and the other participants
 taking the test

314
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,860
 were actually actors
 working for us.

315
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,562
[woman] It's a pretty
standard release form.

316
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:14,298
[Michael] Before the test,
 the participants were required

317
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,300
 to sign a document
 stating that they would be

318
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,502
 under breach of contract
 if they cheated on the test.

319
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,304
When you work
on the individual questions,

320
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:23,507
it's very important
that you work alone.

321
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,176
Don't talk about
what you're doing,

322
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,177
don't share answers.

323
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,879
Good luck.
See you soon.

324
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,581
[Michael] The subjects didn't
 know that there were several

325
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,050
 hidden cameras around
 and that we were watching

326
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:35,586
 everything unfold
 from another room.

327
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:38,255
 During the testing,
the participants and our actors

328
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:40,090
 did not share information.

329
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:42,493
 At no time
 did cheating take place.

330
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:45,329
I'm gonna collect these
and put them in the database,

331
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,231
and I'll be right back
to start the next phase,
okay, guys?

332
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:48,633
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

333
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,602
[Michael] I wore an earpiece
 so that Melissa could guide me

334
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:53,204
 during the entire process.

335
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,306
 A few minutes later,
 it was time

336
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,275
 to set up a false accusation.

337
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,411
So, we actually
might have a problem.

338
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,314
Um, I'll need to speak
to each of you separately.

339
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,982
So, James, could you
come with me just outside?

340
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,350
- Sure.
- I'll take these now.

341
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:08,853
Thank you.
And, um, Nicole,

342
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,154
you can
just wait right here?

343
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:16,227
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,062
You got to give them
enough time to plausibly

345
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,597
- be talking to you.
- Believe that
I'm talking to him.

346
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,633
And calling the director.

347
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,635
- Hi, Nicole.
- Hello.

348
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:28,239
You and James both had

349
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,506
the same wrong answer

350
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:31,008
for the triangle problem.

351
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,143
It looks to me like
there was information sharing.

352
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,045
Like, you guys spoke
to one another about the answer

353
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:37,514
- on that problem?
- I didn't-- I didn't do it.

354
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:40,384
We didn't talk at all
on the individual problems.

355
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:41,652
I kept my eyes on my paper
because I knew

356
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,954
that would probably
throw off the results.

357
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:46,323
If I just write out here,
like,

358
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:52,296
"I admit
that I shared answers."

359
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,098
I don't remember talking
to him at all about,

360
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,267
- like, while we're doing
the individual...
- Okay.

361
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,403
[Michael]
 First I tried to minimize
the consequences of confessing.

362
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:02,106
I really think
it's in your best interest.

363
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,674
I really think it's
in your best interest

364
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:07,044
to sign this stating
that you admit

365
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,212
to sharing the information.

366
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:11,248
I honestly believe
that that is...

367
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,183
But I did not--
Look, I don't know

368
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:15,319
what's going on here.
I really--
that's-- I don't know.

369
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,421
- I came here to help.
- I understand
what you're saying and...

370
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:18,989
And I never said,
like, "Hey, there's..."

371
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,557
- Megan...
- Please let me finish,

372
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:23,360
because I don't appreciate,
like, over-talking and stuff.

373
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:25,696
[Michael] I think I may have
 come on too aggressively.

374
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:28,265
 Next, I tried to maximize
 the consequences

375
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,600
 of not confessing.

376
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,268
What we're looking at
is-- is possible

377
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,636
breach of contract here.

378
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,271
If he comes down here,

379
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:36,974
he's going to be
a lot more upset.

380
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:40,010
If the director
has to come down here,

381
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:41,078
he's gonna be
even more upset

382
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,546
and annoyed
than he already is.

383
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,081
- It did not happen.
- [Michael] Okay.

384
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:45,449
And I-- my--
I put that on my dad,

385
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,718
and I have my dad
around my neck, so...

386
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:50,454
[Michael] Some people
 were just too strong-willed.

387
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:53,190
 Finally, I tried
 to befriend the suspect.

388
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,659
I also understand

389
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,195
you're a nice guy
and, like, sharing information

390
00:14:58,196 --> 00:14:59,964
or helping someone
with a problem

391
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,065
is the nice thing to do.

392
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,366
It's what we normally do.

393
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,567
But I didn't share
any information,

394
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,536
so I can't sign
that document.

395
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,539
[Michael] But this guy
 didn't want to be my friend.

396
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,342
 I struck out with all
 of these test subjects.

397
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,010
 But after these
 failed attempts,

398
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,079
 I was ready to put
 everything I had learned

399
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,047
 into the next encounter.

400
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,083
Is there a strategy
I should use?

401
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,718
I think that
you should proceed

402
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,320
with making sure that you're
not overly confrontational.

403
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:25,155
- Yeah.
- And making sure that she

404
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:28,158
sees you as someone
who she can trust
your advice,

405
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,727
and so I would--
I would proceed

406
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,028
with that kind of approach.

407
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,232
Okay. I'm going in.

408
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,633
Thanks for waiting.

409
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:39,503
- No problem.
- So...

410
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,605
I think we do have a problem.

411
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:45,075
I was looking through
your individual questionnaires.

412
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:48,212
- [Deja] Mm-hmm.
- And you guys both had

413
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,614
the same wrong answer

414
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,216
on the triangle problem.

415
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,517
- Really?
- So, it was kind of

416
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:56,253
this weird, like,
okay, what's going on?

417
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:57,654
Like, statistically,
what are the chances

418
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,256
that two people are gonna have

419
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:01,258
these very unique answers?

420
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,459
[Deja] Mm-hmm.

421
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,396
So, I called
the project director

422
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,132
to see what to do
because if, you know,

423
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,100
this is a sign
that information were shared

424
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,769
during the individual section,

425
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,771
that's a major problem
for the study, right?

426
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,606
We didn't look
at each other's stuff.

427
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,609
That was like--
We were, like, on--

428
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,111
Like, we didn't ask
each other anything,

429
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,613
we didn't,
like, you know...

430
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,481
We didn't talk to each other
the whole entire time.

431
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:27,084
So I don't know how
we got the same answer.

432
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,486
But I'm, like, a hundred
percent sure that that was,

433
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,655
like, the answer
that I came up with.

434
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:34,091
[Michael] Deja was resolute
 about her innocence,

435
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:37,127
 so I changed tactics and
 told her what the consequences

436
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:38,695
 of sharing information
 could be.

437
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:41,165
And that's a really big deal
because through this grant,

438
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,633
we need to have
integrity of the data,

439
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,768
we need to always obey
the rules of the experiment,

440
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,503
and it could even be
a breach of the contract

441
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:49,540
that you guys signed
when you came to do this study.

442
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,208
- Okay.
- [Michael] Deja now knows

443
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,843
 the stakes that are involved.

444
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,411
 My job is to convince her

445
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:56,413
 that I have her best interest
 at heart.

446
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,215
I have to call
the director back, right?

447
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,517
And I could either tell him
I don't know what's going on,

448
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,319
we can't proceed, like,

449
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,787
- you need to come down here.
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:06,123
I don't know
who he's going to involve.

451
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,491
- The easier...
- I don't think any sharing
was involved, though.

452
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:11,194
All I know is that I can't
explain what happened.

453
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,863
- Okay.
- The easier option

454
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,865
is to just document that,

455
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,732
um, information was shared.

456
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,569
- Okay.
- Okay? So, if I write out,

457
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,703
um, you know,

458
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:24,208
"I admit

459
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,178
that I shared,

460
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:29,813
uh, the answer..."

461
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:32,783
- But we didn't.
- [Michael]
"...to the triangle..."

462
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,318
Is that crazy to say

463
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,887
that we didn't
share answers, though?

464
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,188
Because I'm like,

465
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,456
I don't know
what he's saying

466
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,758
or if he said that
he looked at my answer

467
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,827
or we didn't.

468
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:45,629
[Michael]
 Deja wasn't quite convinced.

469
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,798
 So the next tactic
 was to minimize

470
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,600
 the impact of confessing.

471
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,368
I don't know
exactly how it happened.

472
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,337
I just know that
we've got to figure out

473
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,771
the best way forward.

474
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,340
- This is so weird.
- I don't know exactly

475
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,508
how it happened.

476
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,376
It looks like
information sharing.

477
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,712
- If you just tell us
that that happened...
- Say that?

478
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,747
...then what we can do is
I can call the director back

479
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,350
and say that you guys
are cooperating

480
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,919
- and I know him.
- Mm-hmm.

481
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,787
- [Michael]
That's the best thing.
- Okay.

482
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:13,891
I mean, it's not true
but I'll sign it.

483
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,859
Okay. If you sign
and date it,

484
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,227
I can go and call him back,

485
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:18,829
and I'll try to get you
out of here.

486
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,897
Okay.

487
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,698
It's very weird,

488
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,168
but...

489
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:29,940
Okay.

490
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,508
- Thank you very much, Deja.
- You're welcome.

491
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:33,277
I will be--
I'll be right back.

492
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,344
- Okay.
- Thanks for your patience.

493
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:41,652
No problem.

494
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,420
So you did an excellent job

495
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,721
of communicating to her

496
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,356
that it was
in her best interest,

497
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:47,958
that the best way
out of this situation

498
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,393
was to confess.

499
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,894
But it feels so bad.

500
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:53,430
- Of course.
- I mean, she knows
the seriousness.

501
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,667
She knows
that it's a lie.

502
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,969
I mean, I didn't cheat.

503
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,470
I did not cheat.

504
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:05,776
Those were
all my answers.

505
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,278
- Hi.
- Hi.

506
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,648
Okay. Uh,
this concludes the study.

507
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,450
I'm gonna give you
a debrief now,

508
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,319
uh, to tell you
about what we're studying.

509
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,821
- Okay.
- So, first of all,

510
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:18,922
you're not in trouble.

511
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,724
Okay.

512
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,659
The other guy here
works for us.

513
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,795
- [Deja] Okay.
- This is not a study
of logic problems,

514
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,464
it's a study of interrogation

515
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:29,299
and false confessions.

516
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,368
Mm-hmm.

517
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,603
Good one.

518
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,971
You falsely confessed today.

519
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,839
Mm-hmm. I see that.

520
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,341
How do you feel?

521
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,875
I feel mad at myself

522
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:41,612
because I'm usually
the one who, like,

523
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,480
you know, just...

524
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:45,882
sticks to what,

525
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,318
you know, what's right.
I try to, at least.

526
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,386
So, what happened today?

527
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:50,988
It was just scary, I guess,

528
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,458
because it's an environment
I've never been in before

529
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,261
and then just, like,
all the pressure.

530
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,795
It was just like,

531
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:01,365
"Uh, well, I guess,
I should just sign it

532
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,967
and say that I did it."

533
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:05,902
[Michael] Despite knowing
 she was innocent

534
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,438
 and knowing she was admitting
 to breaching a contract,

535
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:11,642
 Deja signed a confession
 that in a true criminal case

536
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,645
 could be used as evidence
 in a trial against her.

537
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,714
Imagine if
there were consequences

538
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:20,384
- and this
was a real crime...
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,386
...how easy it is
to get someone to confess

540
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,922
to something without
even punching them

541
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:27,057
or waterboarding them,

542
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,525
just being nice
and tell them that

543
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,793
it's in their best interest.

544
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,628
Yeah.
That's messed up, actually.

545
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,797
- [Michael] Isn't it?
- That's really crazy.

546
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:36,667
'Cause there's a lot
of people in prison

547
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:42,439
for crimes they didn't do.

548
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,579
[music playing]

549
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,614
[Michael]
 The Innocence Project,

550
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:51,948
 an organization dedicated

551
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,717
 to uncovering
 miscarriages of justice,

552
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,619
 estimates that 20,000 people

553
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,921
 are currently falsely
 imprisoned in the U.S.

554
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:00,624
 The number one cause
is faulty eyewitness testimony,

555
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,392
 and the number two cause,

556
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:05,696
 false confession.

557
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,831
 Interrogation techniques
 are unreliable.

558
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,966
 They can fail to produce
 truthful information

559
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,102
 from suspects
 who are good at lying,

560
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,037
 and, perhaps worse,
 they can manipulate

561
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,473
 innocent suspects
 to confess crimes

562
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,974
 they've never committed.

563
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:20,043
 But neuroscientists
 may have discovered a method

564
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:22,446
 for extracting the truth
 that's impervious

565
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:27,584
 to good liars
 and bad interrogators.

566
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:30,053
 Dr. Peter Rosenfeld
 and his team

567
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,588
 at Northwestern University,

568
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:33,824
 including Ph.D. candidate
 Anne Ward,

569
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,625
 have developed
 a high-tech method

570
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,094
 for lie detection.

571
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,995
You guys brought
with you today

572
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:42,899
a P300-based
concealed information test.

573
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,568
How does that work
and how is it different

574
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,737
than a polygraph
or traditional

575
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,606
verbal-only
interrogation techniques?

576
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:50,941
Well, we're looking at,

577
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,910
um, physiological responses
of the brain

578
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:56,813
in response to information
that's presented.

579
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:59,149
And if the information
is meaningful,

580
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,152
like the murder weapon
that a guilty person used,

581
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:03,620
he will recognize it,

582
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:05,155
and there's
a brain signature to it.

583
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,691
And so, the machine
that we brought with us

584
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:09,760
is basically an EEG machine.

585
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,596
So the way my brain,
your brain,

586
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,964
all of our brains
respond to things

587
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,601
that are meaningful
that we recognize is different

588
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,670
than the way it responds
to novel meaningless things?

589
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:24,708
- Right.
- Has this been used
in a court?

590
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,843
Has it been used
by a prosecution?

591
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:29,479
Not in court,
There are some
Fifth Amendment issues

592
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,782
as far as betraying,
um, yourself,

593
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,617
based on your brain waves.

594
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,118
But you could use it
for witnesses,

595
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,887
or you could use it
within companies

596
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,055
that are already using
polygraph methods.

597
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:41,158
Okay. Well, I'm excited
to see this in action.

598
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,561
I'm gonna step out,
you guys are gonna prepare
the first test.

599
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:45,962
- Okay.
- Excellent. All right.

600
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:48,632
See you soon.

601
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,500
Okay.

602
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:51,802
We're ready
for the test.

603
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,437
Thank you
for joining me.

604
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,638
Hannah from Vsauce,

605
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,939
Wren from Corridor Digital.

606
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,442
So, one of us today
is going to be a thief.

607
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,976
[Michael] Per Dr. Rosenfeld's
 instructions,

608
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:02,078
 we randomly determined
 who would be the thief

609
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,148
 by seeing whoever
 drew the green chip.

610
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,551
Three, two, one.

611
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,553
- [gasps]
- Hannah's the thief.

612
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,687
Oh, my God. I knew it.

613
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:12,522
[Michael]
So, Hannah, go on in.

614
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:14,825
- Look at the item.
- [Hannah] Okay.

615
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,526
[Michael]
 In this real-world scenario

616
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:18,161
 designed by Dr. Rosenfeld,

617
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:21,097
 the designated thief
 actually takes the item,

618
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:23,733
 handles it,
 and gets a good look at it.

619
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:25,202
 This activity causes the item

620
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,070
 to register
 in the subject's mind,

621
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,840
 so they can't help
 but recognize it later.

622
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,908
 The other subjects
 are also required

623
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,778
 to enter the room and sign in
 to prove they were there.

624
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,180
 But never get a look
 at the stolen item.

625
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:40,250
 And, of course, Dr. Rosenfeld
 and Anne have no idea

626
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,751
 who the thief is.

627
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:44,488
 Then each of us is tested.

628
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,722
Go ahead
and take a seat here

629
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:47,123
- and we'll get you all set up.
- Okay.

630
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:49,960
Basically, I'm just gonna
put a couple electrodes

631
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,062
behind your ears
and a couple on your face,

632
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,764
and then, um,
the EEG cap on your head.

633
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,566
What you're gonna do
is you're gonna use

634
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,134
these two mice
in front of you...

635
00:23:58,135 --> 00:23:59,870
- Mm-hmm.
- ...to respond to the images

636
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,238
that you see on the screen.

637
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,139
So you'll see an image,
a string of numbers,

638
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,875
an image,
a string of numbers.

639
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,878
Anytime you see an image,
no matter what it is,

640
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,246
you're gonna
press this button.

641
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,014
All right. Are you ready?

642
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:12,182
[music playing]

643
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:14,251
[Michael]
 The images we were shown

644
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,286
 contained a variety
 of jewelry items,

645
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,054
 including the stolen one.

646
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:21,658
 Of course, Wren and I
hadn't seen any of them before.

647
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,196
[music playing]

648
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:29,132
Hannah didn't consciously react
 to any of them.

649
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,634
 But would her brain waves
 reveal

650
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,004
 the one item she recognizes?

651
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:38,308
 It was time for the results.

652
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:40,010
So here we are.

653
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,778
Have you reached
a conclusion?

654
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,713
Well, based on what we know,

655
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:46,983
and we know that
the stolen item was a watch.

656
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,885
And so we looked
at the brain waves

657
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:50,053
in response to the watch

658
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:51,688
in comparison
to the brain waves

659
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:54,057
in response
to other things.

660
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:57,928
And, uh, we have
two average brain waves,

661
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,997
uh, or event-related
potentials in each frame.

662
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:03,800
The black one
is the average

663
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,835
brain wave response
to the watch.

664
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:09,072
The red trace there
is the response

665
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:12,075
to the other stimuli
all averaged together.

666
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:14,210
We look for
the peak-to-peak difference,

667
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:17,314
 the peak down here,
 versus the highest peak

668
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,915
 following this peak.

669
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,918
And we measure that,
and it's rather obvious

670
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,721
that the biggest response
we found was,

671
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:28,358
uh, Hannah's.

672
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,360
Wow.

673
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:31,962
[Dr. Rosenfeld]
And interesting thing, Michael,

674
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,799
is that you had
a special response

675
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,368
to the watch in comparison
to the other items.

676
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,704
That would suggest
that there's something special

677
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,673
about that stimulus, the watch,

678
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:46,343
that is meaningful to you.
Is it?

679
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,178
I collect watches.

680
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,246
I have about 40 or 50
of them.

681
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:52,115
But Hannah might not have
that kind of excuse.

682
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,150
I don't have
that many watches.

683
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:56,686
And out of three of you,
she definitely has
the biggest response.

684
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:58,221
So off to jail.

685
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,389
[music playing]

686
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,359
[Michael] The P300
 concealed information test

687
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,662
 correctly identified
 which one of us was a thief.

688
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:08,131
But in this next test,
I will be the only suspect,

689
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:10,367
and they will know
that I've stolen something.

690
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,703
But the question will be,
what did I steal?

691
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:15,338
Inside this room
are seven boxes,

692
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:18,108
 and inside those boxes
 are seven different items

693
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,645
 that I've never seen.
My task is to open only one box

694
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,013
 at random and steal that item.

695
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,148
All right.
We've got a...

696
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:28,151
a camouflage hat.

697
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:30,286
And that's not all.
During this next test,

698
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,355
I will be implementing
countermeasures

699
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:34,357
to try to outsmart the test.

700
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:36,826
 I will think
 a very strong thought

701
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,396
 every time something comes up
 that's irrelevant.

702
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,766
 Will that enable me
 to create brain waves

703
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,135
 powerful and dramatic enough

704
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,237
to not be distinguishable
from my response

705
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,306
to the actual item
I'm trying to conceal?

706
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,742
- Anne.
- [Anne] Hello. Welcome back.

707
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:55,178
I, uh, committed a crime.

708
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:57,047
[Michael] Wish me luck,
 because this time,

709
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,383
 there will be punishments
 like in the real world

710
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:04,054
 where getting caught in a lie
 can have consequences.

711
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,956
 And my friend Adam Savage
 was happy to advise me

712
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:08,024
 on my punishment.

713
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,459
- Adam.
- Michael.

714
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,794
I am going to be taking

715
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,797
an EEG lie detection test.

716
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,132
- Okay.
- If I lose,

717
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,867
- there need to be stakes.
- Yeah.

718
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,135
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

719
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:21,371
Naturally, I thought
of Chinese water torture,

720
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:23,840
 which as you know
 from personal experience,

721
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:25,208
 is when someone is restrained

722
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,310
 while water is dripped
 on their forehead.

723
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:29,779
And then right after that,
I thought, I know just the guy

724
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,381
- to talk to about this.
- Okay.

725
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:33,349
Because I--
I want it to be

726
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,319
actually something
that I'm fearing and dreading.

727
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,222
So, yeah,
we did an episode

728
00:27:39,223 --> 00:27:41,324
on Chinese water torture
on Mythbusters,

729
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:44,060
and the creepiest thing
that happened

730
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:47,197
after we did this episode

731
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,499
was that I got an email
from someone

732
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,067
from a throwaway account.

733
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:54,003
He said,
"We found that randomizing

734
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:57,774
when the drops occurred
was incredibly effective."

735
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:00,844
That anything that happens
on a regular periodicity

736
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,245
can become a type
of meditation,

737
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:04,114
and you can then
tune it out.

738
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:07,383
If you couldn't predict it,

739
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,119
you're-- he said,

740
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,855
"We found, we were able
to induce a psychotic break

741
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,289
within 20 hours."

742
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,525
Sounds like
the stakes that I want.

743
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:17,327
- All right.
- Thanks.

744
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,129
You're welcome, sir.

745
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,230
[Michael]
 So now, under the threat

746
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,065
 of Chinese water torture,

747
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,768
 I was extra motivated
 to beat the lie detector.

748
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,905
[music playing]

749
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:30,039
[Anne] All right.

750
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,776
That is it.

751
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,811
I was trying
to think about all kinds

752
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:35,912
of frightening scenarios,

753
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:37,280
I was trying
to tense up to make sure

754
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,516
I was really uncomfortable
the way I was sitting.

755
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,518
Well, for most tests,
that would work.

756
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,154
But we will take a look
at this data and see...

757
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,822
- [Michael] Yes, we will.
- ...what it shows.

758
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:47,791
[sighs]

759
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,359
Wow. Okay.

760
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,528
I don't think they're going
to be able to figure out

761
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,797
what item I stole.

762
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:57,033
 I really kept my mind active.

763
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,568
 I was going crazy
 with countermeasures.

764
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,937
 I was sitting uncomfortably,
 I was thinking about

765
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,039
all kinds of really
crazy things.

766
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,440
I was thinking about like,

767
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:06,309
"What if I have
diarrhea right now?

768
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,011
How would that feel?
How do I hold it back?

769
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,345
And maybe I do have diarrhea."

770
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:11,114
All these things
that were sort of physical

771
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:13,082
in nature as well.
I thought a lot about death

772
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,918
and dying
and being dismembered.

773
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,920
 And if they can get it right,

774
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,589
I would probably blame
witchcraft as well as science.

775
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,324
[Dr. Rosenfeld] Well, it's--
I would say that's it.

776
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:22,926
Yeah, okay.

777
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,195
[Dr. Rosenfeld] We're ready
to give him our best guess.

778
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,396
Hello.

779
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,264
- Hi.
- Hi.

780
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,299
- [Michael] Are you guys ready?
- Yup.

781
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,935
Let me ask you this.
First of all,

782
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,437
how confident do you feel?

783
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:35,471
Pretty confident.

784
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:38,041
What did I take?

785
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,108
The camo hat.

786
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:40,577
- Camo hat.
- Camo hat?

787
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,611
Yeah.

788
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:47,350
[music playing]

789
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:49,319
[Michael]
That's impressive.

790
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,121
Did you see any evidence
of countermeasures being used?

791
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:54,157
Not something I would swear to.

792
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,059
Even while
I was doing the test,

793
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,594
I thought, you know what?

794
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:02,098
 I'm reacting too quickly
 to the actual item.

795
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:05,869
I should also treat it
as though it's irrelevant.

796
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,136
I should treat them
all the same.

797
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:09,205
[Dr. Rosenfeld]
If you are consistently

798
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:12,108
reacting to all
of the irrelevance

799
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:14,477
with their specific
countermeasure responses

800
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:16,613
that you formed
in your mind,

801
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,449
they should produce
bigger P300s also.

802
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,986
But the biggest will still be
produced by the camo hat,

803
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,021
even if you were
countering it also.

804
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:29,525
That means
I now have to be punished.

805
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:32,495
[music playing]

806
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:34,330
Science is improving
in its ability

807
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:36,332
to read people's minds.

808
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,668
And that raises some
difficult ethical dilemmas.

809
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:42,639
We would have nothing to fear
from perfect lie detectors

810
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,242
if the people using them
had perfect morals.

811
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:49,112
So, the prospect of a
scientifically rigorous method

812
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:52,181
of extracting information,
while exciting,

813
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:54,250
is also terrifying.

814
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:56,519
As we continue to probe
interrogation methods

815
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,055
scientifically,
we have to also continue

816
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,624
to probe them ethically.

817
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:05,295
You know, Chinese water torture
isn't even Chinese.

818
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,997
Its earliest description
comes from Italy

819
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,399
in the 15th century.

820
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,367
And the Chinese name
was added later

821
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:14,070
to make it sound
more mysterious.

822
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:16,673
Oh, man, these irregular drops

823
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,242
are supposed to drive you
slowly insane.

824
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:21,377
You know, I think
this is a lot less

825
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:25,048
about getting information
and more about punishment.

826
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,617
And as always,

827
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:32,021
thanks for watching.
