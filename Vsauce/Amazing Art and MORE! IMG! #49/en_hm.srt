1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:06,259
Babies with beards and cups of warm kitty.
Take it easy, because we are about to loose

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,039
control.
It's episode 49 of IMG!

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,739
Okay, whose legs are whose?
And can you find the hidden scary face?

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,029
If Pac-Man has a skull, it probably looks
like this.

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,189
And Information Is Beautiful analyzed horoscopes
to create a visualization of the most commonly

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,389
used words by sign.
Words in red were uniquely common for each

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,269
sign.
The Earth orbits on a tilt, so as the year

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,589
progresses, the terminator, the line marking
the border between night and day sways back

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,308
and forth.
These pictures were all taken at 6 a.m. from

10
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:51,728
September 2010 to September 2011, giving us
an incredible time lapse of day and night

11
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:55,529
on Earth for one year.
Makes you a bit dizzy?

12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,748
Well, just be sure you don't puke ribbons.
Oh, a facelifting cream.

13
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:04,549
Ooops.
The lines on a parking lot can be dandelions

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:11,719
and Craig Alan painted these portraits of
famous faces, made out of people standing around.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,539
Here's a cat... but where does it end?
Oookay.

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,719
This cat isn't as big, but the mess he made is.

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,999
And Kerry Skarbakka uses rock climbing equipment,
safe landing mats or sometimes nothing to

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,099
make these photos of himself falling.
Seth Casteel captures dogs falling into water.

19
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:50,999
And Robert Downey Jr. as a pin-up girl is
something fun to gawk at.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,279
Though you can also gawk at Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel by using the Vatican's amazing

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,659
virtual tour.
It's almost more of a DONG than an IMG, but

22
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,478
go ahead, look around with the mouse and zoom
in and out by scrolling.

23
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,938
The art is amazing, but let's be honest.
All paintings are better with cats added.

24
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,979
Now this hurts my brain.
Moving dots, whose meaning is ambiguous, we

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,759
can add cues that make it look like a spinning
helix or enable a different cue that turns

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,639
it into a waving ribbon.
Still crazier, a cue that turns your perception

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,139
of the whole thing into a chain of flat moving bulges.

28
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,718
I love these photographs of people whose arms
melt into the horizon.

29
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,399
Oh, and this roller-coaster?
It's actually a walking coaster.

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,888
The loop, though, is pretty much impossible to travel.

31
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:49,488
I Love Graphs showed off a sweet chocolate
chart and Palindrome.

32
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,399
Get it?
On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming you guys have

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,009
been awesome.
Manuel points out a can't-unsee-fact about

34
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,488
the ampersand.
Ashley showed us a grandfather clock with

35
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,429
an attitude.
And Garett suggested a clever Easter prank.

36
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,408
Oh and Shelby said "Ladies..."
Here's an artist who draws shoes turning into

37
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:17,979
umbrellas and has also built super-cool squashed-bug
wallpaper, tables that collide, do backflips

38
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,958
and play Twister.
Yayoi Kusama put a blank white room in a museum

39
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,259
and then gave stickers to kids, who could
place them anywhere.

40
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,639
It was fun.
And after long enough, it got pretty gosh darn

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,499
awesome.
So is the room of heights, where

42
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,359
visitors were asked to measure and mark their
own height on a wall, eventually leaving a

43
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,068
thick human-height-sized band across the room.
Too analytical?

44
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,988
Well how about we just get a giant helium
balloon covered in charcoal spikes.

45
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,608
Batting it around draws on the walls.
If your car gets stuck you might need camel

46
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,119
to...wing.
And this week, 9Gag showed me that tortoise

47
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,968
still has a few tricks up his shell.
Ned Hardy displayed Star Wars if Doctor Seuss

48
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,798
had written it.
And Cecilia Paredes paints herself to hide,

49
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,158
just like Bolin, except she often leaves her
hair and eyes strikingly visible.

50
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,119
I leave you with a mystery.
An optical illusion consisting of moving dots

51
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,749
and circles, but what's crazy is that we,
to this day, do not know why our brains add

52
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,869
this illusory contour connecting the dots.
There's no known mechanism or theory yet proposed

53
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,849
to explain what we see.
If you figure it out, you should probably

54
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,150
let science know, but until then...
As always, thanks for watching.
