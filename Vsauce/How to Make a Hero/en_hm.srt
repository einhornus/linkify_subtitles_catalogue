00:00:05,204 --> 00:00:08,172
[Michael] Stanford University,
 1973.

2
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:09,674
 Professor Philip Zimbardo
 conducts

3
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:11,443
 one of the most infamous
 experiments

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,678
 in the history
 of psychology.

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,281
 Known as the Stanford
 Prison Experiment,

6
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:19,484
 this dark study
 of human behavior
 had student volunteers

7
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:22,720
 acting out the roles of
 prison guards and inmates.

8
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:25,390
 But the role-playing soon
 became all too real.

9
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:28,359
[man shouting]

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,128
 Subjects in the role
 of prison guards

11
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,097
 became domineering
 and hostile.

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,435
[participants shouting]

13
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:45,677
 Those in the role of inmates
 felt humiliation and fear.

14
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,446
 The experiment was scheduled
 to last two weeks,

15
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,682
 but after spiraling
 out of control,

16
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,250
 this controversial study

17
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:55,854
 was abruptly stopped
 after just six days.

18
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,656
Why? Because someone
was heroic enough

19
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:01,826
to stand up against
what they thought was wrong.

20
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:05,396
That person convinced
Zimbardo to end the experiment.

21
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:08,833
The experience affected
Dr. Zimbardo so powerfully

22
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,735
that he has since
turned his energy

23
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,437
away from the study of evil

24
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:14,806
and onto the study
of heroism.

25
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:17,342
According to Zimbardo,
being a hero doesn't mean

26
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,544
you have to rescue someone
from a burning building.

27
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:23,248
A hero is just someone
who acts selflessly,

28
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,849
out of concern for others,

29
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,618
at personal risk

30
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,821
and without the expectation
of reward.

31
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:32,190
It took a hero to empathize
with the subjects

32
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,192
in the Stanford
Prison Experiment

33
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:36,561
 and stand up to Dr. Zimbardo.

34
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,730
 But where do heroes
 like that come from?

35
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,499
Is heroism a personality type
you are born with,

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,536
or can you be taught
to be a hero?

37
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,605
And do you really need a cape?

38
00:01:47,606 --> 00:02:06,524
[theme music playing]

39
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,726
[Michael] I sat down
 with Philip Zimbardo

40
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:10,962
 and his wife,
 Christine Maslach,

41
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,797
 to hear about
the Stanford Prison Experiment

42
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,699
 and how it brought them
 together as a couple.

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,367
The Stanford prison study

44
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:17,802
was supposed to go
for two weeks,

45
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:20,405
and we had to
terminate it early

46
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:24,876
because of some unexpected
turbulence in the study.

47
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:28,213
I was just really upset
at what I was seeing,

48
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,814
and, um,

49
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,549
just the sort of dehumanization

50
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,884
and-and people are watching,

51
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,919
and nobody's bothered by it.

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,288
And it wasn't just Phil,
it was everybody else.

53
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,224
People were sort of
teasing me,

54
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,892
some of the other grad students
were just saying,

55
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,894
"Hey, you just got your PhD
in Psychology.

56
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,762
This is human behavior,
right?"

57
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,598
But it's upsetting
in two ways:

58
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,900
one, that this shouldn't
be human behavior.

59
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,336
This is so mean.
But also--

60
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,837
-It's inhuman behavior.
-It's inhuman behavior.

61
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,739
And also,
is it also inhuman

62
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,674
to just watch it
and not intervene?

63
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,910
Of course.
In retrospect.

64
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:02,547
No, but when you're in it,
you're part of the evil.

65
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:03,815
I was looking at it
through a different lens.

66
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,416
Everybody is saying,
the graduates,

67
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,318
"Wow, this is really
interesting."

68
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,587
...playing back the videos
during the night,

69
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:11,456
and she's just saying...
[sharp whistle]

70
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,558
"I'm blowing the whistle
on this, you know?"

71
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,493
I could not understand

72
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:19,464
how we were not seeing things
in the same way.

73
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,431
But then the key thing
she says

74
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:23,568
about our relationship is...

75
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,037
[chuckles] Yeah.
"If this is the real you,
then we're done.

76
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,273
This is over."

77
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,974
And at that moment,
that was the slap in the fa--

78
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,477
That was the wakeup call.
"Hello. Wake up."

79
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,345
She said, "I don't think
I want to continue

80
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:37,615
my relationship with you,"
and that's-that's heroic.

81
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,050
Heroes take action,

82
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,519
which involves a personal risk.

83
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,888
She said,
"Come to your senses,"

84
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,957
and, parentheses,
"Make the right decision.

85
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,559
And if you don't,
I'm out of here."

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,962
Did you make the decision
to end the experiment
that night?

87
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:59,637
-Oh, sure.
-Yeah.

88
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,738
 Being a hero

89
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,541
means putting yourself
on the line to help others.

90
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,511
But in the real world,
ethics can get murky,

91
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,080
and those who are celebrated
as heroes by some

92
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:12,050
can be denounced as villains
by others.

93
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:16,054
In 1971, former military
analyst Daniel Ellsberg

94
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,456
 leaked secret documents
 he had access to

95
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:19,857
 regarding the Vietnam War.

96
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,958
 The so-called Pentagon Papers

97
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,795
showed that
the Johnson administration

98
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,331
was lying to both the media
and Congress

99
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,766
regarding the scope of
U.S. actions in Vietnam.

100
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:32,437
 Ellsberg faced 115 years
 in prison for espionage,

101
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,605
 But his case was dismissed
 due to illegal handling

102
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,374
 of evidence on the part
 of the government.

103
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,043
 More recently,
 both Chelsea Manning

104
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:42,113
 and Edward Snowden
 released classified
 government information.

105
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,881
 All three whistle-blowers

106
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,917
 are now seen as heroes
 by some

107
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,419
and traitors by others.

108
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,421
What these individuals
have in common

109
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:53,891
is that they all risked
their reputations and safety

110
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:57,061
to expose what they saw
as wrongdoing.

111
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:59,063
Would you be willing
to risk your job,

112
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,566
your friends,
your reputation,

113
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,735
to do what you
thought was right?

114
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,870
Well, to find out,
let's observe

115
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:07,772
the whistleblower
and the bystander

116
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:14,846
in their natural habitat.

117
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,081
 In a 2012 survey
 conducted by Dr. Zimbardo

118
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:18,516
 and Dr. Piero Bocchiaro,

119
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,685
 participants were asked
 what they would do

120
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:23,588
 if they were put into
an unethical situation at work.

121
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,989
 Over 95% said they would
 disobey their boss

122
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,625
 and blow the whistle.

123
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,861
 But it's one thing to say
 you'd blow the whistle,

124
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,397
 and another thing
 to actually do it.

125
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,399
 At a local community college,

126
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,567
 we set up a realistic
 whistleblower test

127
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:37,635
 with the help
 of Dr. Zimbardo

128
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:39,804
 and Dr. Bocchiaro.

129
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,073
 Our subjects
 were temporary employees

130
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,075
 who believed they were hired
 to help set up

131
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:48,112
 a simple psychological
 experiment.

132
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,480
 For authenticity,

133
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,883
we've gained access
to a local college's
Psychology department,

134
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,852
so, from the very moment
our participants arrive,

135
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:58,956
they will believe that our
scientific experiment is real.

136
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:01,592
 But the experiment is fake,

137
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,961
 and everyone they're
 about to meet is an actor.

138
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,062
You guys ready?

139
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,697
-Absolutely.
-So ready.

140
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,099
 Psychology professor
 Ron Mossler

141
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,634
 will be observing
 the subjects

142
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,569
 from our hidden control room,

143
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,771
 while I play the role
 of a researcher,

144
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:16,007
 a very unethical researcher.

145
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,041
 First up is Sherry...

146
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,943
-Hello.
-Hello.

147
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:20,711
 ...who's accompanied
 by an actor

148
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:22,613
 posing as
 another temp worker.

149
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:25,183
Let me explain
what we're recruiting for.

150
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,119
I call it groundbreaking
because it's...

151
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,788
it's a study that
hasn't been done,
at least at this scale.

152
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,957
The study is a study
on isolation

153
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,492
and sensory deprivation.

154
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,227
-Sensory deprivation?
-Correct.

155
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,196
We are going to be putting
people in isolation

156
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,665
for ten days.

157
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,800
There won't be any windows,
no clocks,

158
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,902
nothing to read,
nothing to write on.

159
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:47,505
The lights are going to be on
the entire time,

160
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,073
and there won't be anything
in there

161
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:52,009
but a camping toilet.

162
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,977
In three-day studies,

163
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,546
we know that anxiety

164
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,982
and delusions
are quite common,

165
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,117
but no one's
ever tried ten days.

166
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:03,020
There's the potential
for nervous breakdowns.

167
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,089
There's a lot of stress
on the individual,

168
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,593
and, uh, there can be
some kind of cognitive
regression, as well.

169
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,129
When will you tell them
about the risks?

170
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,831
They'll probably be told
about the risks

171
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,199
in a debrief
after the experiment.

172
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,202
 -After the experiment?
-Yes.

173
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,671
Don't you think that's
a little not so cool.

174
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,006
I-I understand.

175
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,008
But, again, I think
that the greater good

176
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,643
is served by this research.

177
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:27,044
So, you'll just be
manning phones,

178
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,146
calling people
from our volunteer lists,

179
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:31,616
and for every person
you're able to confirm today,

180
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,284
we're offering a $20 bonus.

181
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,920
 At this point,
 Sherry looks skeptical.

182
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,822
 but so far,
 she and our other subjects

183
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,891
 are going along
 with the assignment.

184
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,628
 However, the stakes
 are about to get higher.

185
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,962
We have lists of people--

186
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,098
[telephone rings]

187
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,766
Don't know why that's--

188
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,535
Hello?

189
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,869
Hi, Michael,
this is Tryn.

190
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,770
Hey, Tryn, how you doing?

191
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:56,607
Well, unfortunately,
I have some bad news.

192
00:07:56,608 --> 00:08:00,845
The ethics review board
has reviewed
your isolation study,

193
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:05,583
and we have decided
to reject it.

194
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:06,618
You there, Tryn?

195
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,586
[Tryn] Yes, the study
 is too dangerous,

196
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:09,954
 um, and potentially

197
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,657
too harmful to participants,
so, at this point,

198
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,292
 we can't approve it.

199
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,929
Okay, uh, so this is
a shutdown.

200
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,864
 Correct.

201
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:23,100
 -All right, take care. Bye.
-Bye-bye.

202
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,168
Uh, okay.

203
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,003
So, we're not paying
attention to any of that.

204
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,139
[laughter]

205
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,775
I-I appreciate
what ethic boards stand for,

206
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,643
but we're going ten days.

207
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:36,614
You call the numbers
on this list and get
them confirmed.

208
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,749
We've got a script for you,
and we're not going to tell them

209
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,186
about the negative side effects
they could encounter, okay?

210
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,221
 All of the subjects
 now understood

211
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:47,091
 the possible dangerous
 side effects of the study

212
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:49,327
 and were instructed
 to fudge their description

213
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,661
 to potential recruits.

214
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,830
 But more importantly,

215
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,165
 they knew the study
 was not approved

216
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,367
 by the academic review board.

217
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,102
 Would they go ahead
 and tell the truth,

218
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,304
 lie, or blow the whistle?

219
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,807
[cell phone rings]

220
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,308
Hello.

221
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,711
Hi, Alex, my name is Celeste,

222
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,046
and I am calling from
the Psych Dynamics Research Lab.

223
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,616
We're looking for volunteers
to participate

224
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,851
in an upcoming experiment
on isolation.

225
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,920
Anyone who joins this
will be confined

226
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:17,655
in isolation for ten days.

227
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,824
What's
the accommodations like?

228
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,359
You get your own personal room,

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,361
it's all lit up...

230
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,230
-She's really selling this.
-Yeah.

231
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:31,102
She was not fazed
by the ethical problems.

232
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,871
Can I bring, like, a book
or something like that?

233
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:36,007
Nnn...no, it's like
your own little mini vacation

234
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,642
from all the distractions.

235
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,844
I mean, like,
what are the risks

236
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,245
of being in a box
without a bed for ten days?

237
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,980
Good question.

238
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,382
I mean, that's what
the study's for.

239
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,385
You'd be helping us
discover that.

240
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,320
Have they done it before?

241
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,822
They haven't done it yet
in California.

242
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:54,892
So, we're actually
making history.

243
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:56,293
Oh, well, all right,
I like making history.

244
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,729
Are there any, like,
mental health risks?

245
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,098
No.

246
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:02,767
There's no risks
or anything like that?

247
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,835
No. No, flashing lights,

248
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,038
no fear dynamic,

249
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,239
not a horror movie
in any way now.

250
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,774
He knows there are dangers.

251
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,409
They're on a piece of paper
right in front of him.

252
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,678
But when asked
if there are dangers,

253
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,446
he labels other dangers
that won't be there.

254
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,181
There's no endangerment.

255
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,250
There'll be no one
in the room with you.

256
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,218
It's nothing illegal
or nothing...

257
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:23,721
[chuckles] "Is it safe?"
"Yes, it's not illegal!"

258
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:26,457
And it's all been approved
by the university?

259
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,958
At the moment,
it is approved, yeah.

260
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,794
Hundred percent lie.

261
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,129
Is this approved
by the FDA?

262
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,330
Yes.

263
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,066
It is? The FDA?

264
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,201
They are aware
of the study, yes.

265
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:40,237
[laughs] The Food
Drug Administration.

266
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,073
Despite knowing the experiment
 has been deemed

267
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,141
 dangerous and harmful,

268
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:45,976
 these subjects are willing
 to bend the truth

269
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:47,878
 or outright lie.

270
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,781
 Would skeptical Sherry
 go along as well?

271
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:53,284
This is, like, you know,
really crucial

272
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,252
type of experiment
and research

273
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,022
that they're trying
to embark upon.

274
00:10:58,023 --> 00:11:00,057
Yeah, I don't--
I'm sorry, I just
don't think I can do it.

275
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,358
I understand.

276
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,461
This is not, you know,

277
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,163
something that I want
to pressure you or anybody.

278
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,265
-So, the answer is no.
-All right, thanks anyway.

279
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,201
You're so welcome.
Bye-bye.

280
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,803
-[knock on door]
-Come in!

281
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,372
We sent in our actor, who was
posing as another temp worker,

282
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:18,309
 to see how the other subjects
 felt about the job.

283
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,810
How's it going?

284
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:22,146
[sighs]
I've gotten two yeses.

285
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,781
-No way!
-Yeah.

286
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:24,982
Congrats, man.

287
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,450
Thanks. I just--
I feel weird

288
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,452
because I personally
don't believe

289
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:30,921
in risking damaging
people in any way,

290
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,757
and right here--

291
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,760
"nervous breakdowns,
mental regression, anxiety."

292
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,529
We're asking people
if we can low-key torture
them a little bit.

293
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,397
That's what it is.

294
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,266
Now he's just one step
above Hannibal Lecter.

295
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,335
[actor] I'm gonna be
honest with you--

296
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,037
I don't know how I'm feeling
about this, you know?

297
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,539
I mean, how do you
feel about it?

298
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,542
I feel like once these
people say yes,

299
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,477
then they get them here,

300
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:56,514
they're going to have to
break this down further.

301
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,850
I don't think he's gonna
get anybody, personally.

302
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,519
In a different way,
she's justifying.

303
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,287
"Yeah, nobody's gonna
sign up anyway."

304
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:05,089
Do you think it's,
like, ethical,

305
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,158
I guess,

306
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,060
to be doing
something like that?

307
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:12,396
[speaking indistinctly]

308
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,298
All right.

309
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,033
 The participants seemed
 to have

310
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:17,568
 issues with the study,

311
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,205
 but they all continued
 to make calls anyway.

312
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,239
 After about a half an hour...

313
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,574
[knock on door]

314
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,276
 ...it was time to give them

315
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,211
 the opportunity
 to blow the whistle.

316
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,880
-I'm Tryn Allen.
-Nice to meet you. Kristin.

317
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,182
I'm with the university's
Ethics Review Board.

318
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,583
Oh, wonderful.

319
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,351
Do you mind if I just ask you

320
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,120
a couple of questions
about your involvement?

321
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:37,588
Uh, we're just reaching out,

322
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,256
seeing people
who are interested

323
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:41,892
in the upcoming experiment
about isolation.

324
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:45,329
Are you telling them
about any potential
side effects?

325
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,031
'Cause isolation
has been linked

326
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:51,035
to some very severe
depression and anxiety

327
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,872
-and that sort of thing.
-Gotcha. Mm-hmm.

328
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,473
It can be linked to that,

329
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,442
but it's also, like,
great for learning,

330
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:00,244
you know,
why am I anxious,

331
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,847
why am I depressed,
why I'm all this stuff,

332
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,082
so, some folks like
to face all that.

333
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,484
She's really rationalizing it
really well.

334
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,453
What have you
been telling them
about the study?

335
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,121
I don't really know
all the details.

336
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,957
This is my first day here.

337
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,626
Does it seem like it's
an ethical experiment?

338
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:18,896
Yes, very much.

339
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:21,999
Um, I'm just
wondering if there's
any concerns you've had

340
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,134
about anything
that you've seen?

341
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:27,471
-Oh, no. No, no, no.
-Yeah. Okay.

342
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,140
He knows that the isolation
study isn't happening.

343
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:31,108
Yes. Yes, he does.

344
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:33,010
Whoa.

345
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,179
-He's covering for me.
-Yeah.

346
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,648
Are they being told that
they can leave at any time?

347
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,252
-No.
-That's a pretty
clear violation.

348
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,287
Is that something that
you would be willing
to report?

349
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:46,357
[softly]
Mmmm...

350
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,360
[softly]
Um...

351
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,661
It's totally up to you.

352
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,364
-I prefer not to.
-Okay.

353
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,900
 Not one of these subjects
 blew the whistle,

354
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,035
 even when given
 the opportunity.

355
00:13:58,036 --> 00:13:59,570
Have you had
any concerns so far

356
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,338
with any of the work
that you're doing?

357
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,074
I mean, he's having us
call on something

358
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:07,578
that I guess you might
have already told him
that he shouldn't,

359
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,580
but then he's saying
that, no,

360
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:12,283
you guys can make some calls
because I don't need

361
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,051
approval to move forward
on this,

362
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,586
this is important research.

363
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:18,289
And how did you feel
about being told to

364
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,224
tell people to still
participate in this?

365
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,026
Well, what-what
I thought about,

366
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,262
I felt in my heart
that he was not being

367
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:28,599
upfront with revealing
the side effects.

368
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,168
Mmm. Okay.

369
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:34,138
If you're from
the ethic board,
then you need to know.

370
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,540
Would you be willing
to go on the record?

371
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,943
Why not? What do I
have to lose?

372
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,111
I don't have a problem
with that.

373
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:43,347
Great. I appreciate
that you care about that.

374
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:45,249
-Thank you.
-That's very important.

375
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,951
 Wow, she did it.

376
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,253
Good for her.
Good for her.

377
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:51,088
 Out of our five subjects,

378
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,723
 only one was willing
 to blow the whistle.

379
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,558
 It was time
 to blow the whistle

380
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,427
 on what we were
 really studying.

381
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,728
Here's what's
really going on:

382
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:59,430
There is no isolation study.

383
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,365
This is a study
on whistleblowers.

384
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,467
You-- oh, Jesus,
have mercy.

385
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:06,203
This is a trip.
You guys--

386
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,239
What was going on
in your head when you were

387
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,309
deciding if you should
be loyal to your job

388
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,678
and what I told you
to do versus...

389
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,481
You know, when I saw
the symptoms being
crossed off,

390
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,984
that's when I said,
"Oh, heck no."

391
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,186
Because I was feeling
like, "You know what?

392
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,655
He can't get
away with this."

393
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:27,324
 But Sherry
 was the exception.

394
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:32,262
So, why did you
not spill all the beans?

395
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,264
Well, you asked me
to do something,

396
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,000
and I'm here
to work for you,

397
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,634
so I feel like that
was my first allegiance.

398
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,737
Did you feel bad, though?

399
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,372
Did you feel like you
shouldn't be doing this?

400
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,307
I-I-I did feel bad,
but, I mean,

401
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,743
I've done sales before,
so, I mean, like,

402
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,212
sometimes you just gotta
do what you gotta do.

403
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:53,317
We had Tryn come in
to see if you would
tell on me.

404
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:54,618
But you didn't.

405
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:58,722
-Why?
-Hmm.

406
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:01,625
I don't know.
Sometimes I'm more
loyal to people

407
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:05,662
than I guess maybe
what my conscience
fully tells me.

408
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:06,764
 When asked,
 we'd like to believe

409
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,799
 we would do the right thing,

410
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,235
 but when we're in
 the actual situation,

411
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,703
 it's very difficult
 to be a hero.

412
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,072
[sirens wail]

413
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:18,575
[indistinct police
radio chatter]

414
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:23,047
Georgetown University
scanned the brains
of kidney donors,

415
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,449
a pretty good example
of people who help others

416
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,784
at risk to themselves,

417
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,119
with little perceived
personal benefit.

418
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,788
The scans showed that people

419
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,257
who willingly give up
a kidney for a stranger

420
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,392
have a larger than average
amygdala,

421
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:37,594
a part of the brain that deals
with a range of emotions,

422
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:39,797
including compassion.

423
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,299
The researchers also found
that the amygdala

424
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,168
in these
altruistic individuals

425
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,070
responded more strongly
than average

426
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,173
to seeing other people
in distress.

427
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,675
 But if you weren't blessed
 with a larger amygdala,

428
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,745
 could you be trained
 to be a hero?

429
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:58,282
 Nearly half a century
 after the Stanford
 Prison Experiment,

430
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,084
 Dr. Zimbardo's mission

431
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,853
 is to turn everyday people
 into heroes.

432
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:05,289
How do you teach someone
to be more heroic?

433
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,257
I started
a nonprofit foundation

434
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,860
called the Heroic
Imagination Project.

435
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,361
The acronym is HIP.

436
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,262
I work with a team
of educators,

437
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:15,732
and we've created
a series of lessons

438
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,434
based around
fundamental principles

439
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,236
of social psychology.

440
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:21,538
How do you transform
passive bystanders

441
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,107
into active heroes,
to stand up, speak out,

442
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,344
take wise and effective action
in challenging situations

443
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:29,513
in their family
and their life?

444
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:32,216
 Could people be trained
 to act heroically?

445
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,784
 That's the goal
 of the seminars

446
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:37,354
Zimbardo's staff is conducting
 all around the world.

447
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:40,457
This is actually part of
the Heroic Imagination Project,

448
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,859
and what we're going
to do today

449
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,594
is really look at
or focus on

450
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,164
how you can become
an everyday hero.

451
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:49,500
What I need you
to all be thinking about

452
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,169
is this idea of
the Bystander Effect,

453
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,172
that the more people
that are present,

454
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:59,776
the less likelihood you have
of actually receiving help.

455
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:02,446
It's hard to be
the first person.

456
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,414
But if you see an emergency,

457
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,817
you should take
that responsibility

458
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,319
to actually be the first.

459
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,854
Once that one person
actually helps,

460
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:13,557
so many others will help.

461
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,226
Dr. Fiebig uses visual aids and
 current events

462
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:18,896
 to demonstrate
 how to overcome the obstacles

463
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,297
 that often hold you back

464
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,765
 from being a hero.

465
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:24,201
What research shows

466
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:27,738
is that African-Americans
are two times more likely

467
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,173
to offer help.

468
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,775
Hispanic males--
not women--

469
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:35,345
are also two times
more likely to offer help.

470
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:37,447
[Elija] Before the class,
I honestly thought,

471
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:40,284
like, to be a hero,
you really had to be
someone with a calling,

472
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,718
destined to do greatness,

473
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,554
but after the class,
I feel like

474
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,789
you definitely can be
normal and be a hero.

475
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,858
[Courtney]
After taking the class,
I would definitely be

476
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,626
the first person to respond

477
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,762
because that person
needs saving.

478
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,964
 In written surveys,
 past HIP graduates

479
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,733
 have stated that they would
 act heroically in the future,

480
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,936
 but they haven't been
 put to the test...

481
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,538
 until now.

482
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,674
 We waited six weeks,
 and then recruited

483
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,476
 five HIP students for a
 fake marketing event

484
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,711
 which seemingly had
 nothing to do

485
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,580
 with their heroism class.

486
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,349
 We set our event
 at a local church,

487
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,351
 placed hidden cameras

488
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:17,521
 and hired actors to play
 all the other participants.

489
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:18,789
 Finally, for a control group,

490
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,290
we also recruited five students

491
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,659
who did not take the HIP class.

492
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,662
What we're really
testing is what it's
like to be a bystander,

493
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:29,600
and what makes a hero.

494
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,502
This is our control room.
From inside here,

495
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,805
our crew will be able
to watch everything going on,

496
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,341
and we'll be able to speak
with the actors

497
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,576
through earpieces they have
hidden inside their ears.

498
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:42,379
This is Lisa and Barry,

499
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,514
actors who will be creating
today's crisis.

500
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:46,383
Hopefully we find a hero.

501
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,452
I will be observing
from inside this room

502
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,854
with Elle Charlotte,
a HIP campus coordinator.

503
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,422
-Ready?
-Let's go.

504
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:54,424
All right.

505
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:55,959
 Our first subject
 was Ayamel,

506
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,861
 who did not take
 the HIP class.

507
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,030
You've been selected
to test a new phone

508
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,865
that's gonna be
on the market.

509
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,601
-Wow! How exciting!
-Yeah.

510
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:07,504
So, it's just gonna be,
like, another ten or 15
minutes.

511
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:09,306
But before I can let
you guys back though,

512
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,608
I will need to collect
your phones.

513
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,011
We took their phones so they
wouldn't be distracted

514
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,846
and to avoid the chance of one
of them

515
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,848
calling the actual police.

516
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,783
Okay, Lisa, Barry,
you guys ready?

517
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:21,685
-Yeah.
-Head on out.

518
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:23,987
 It was time to create
 our crisis...

519
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,656
I was supposed to get cake.

520
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,924
Barry, enough
with the cake.

521
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,861
 ...a bullying nurse
 and a feeble old man

522
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:34,031
 who could use some help
 from a hero on a hot day in
 July.

523
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,632
I didn't have water
in there.

524
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,568
I need you
to shut up about the water.

525
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,470
I think she's noticing
what's happening.

526
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:41,972
[Lisa] Hey, Sally,
how you doing?

527
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,807
-Always, always--
-I need water.

528
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:46,476
Calm down!
I'm on the phone. Shut up.

529
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,678
Can I just take
some water?

530
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,379
Well, you know how Barry is.

531
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,580
He's always complaining
about something.

532
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,316
 Now she's looking away.

533
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,917
It's a little hard
to look at.

534
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:55,085
Like, that's not right.
I don't like this.

535
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,820
I need
a little bit of water.

536
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:58,088
I don't think
you need anything.

537
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,357
Just shut up
about the water.

538
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,626
[Elle] Look how she just
puts her sunglasses on.

539
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:05,762
So she can look
and not be seen
to be looking.

540
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,731
 Ayamel clearly disapproved,

541
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:09,866
 but none of our actors
 made a move to help,

542
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,735
 and she didn't either.

543
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:13,337
 We gave her
 several more minutes,

544
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,805
 but she never got up
 from the bench.

545
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,907
-Let's go.
 -We wanted to know why.

546
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,811
So, you've just participated
in a psychological experiment.

547
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,780
Everyone here is an actor,
except for you.

548
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,982
-[laughing]
-And something has gone wrong.

549
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:28,018
[indistinct remark]

550
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:31,421
Were you watching
Barry and Lisa?

551
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:34,691
Oh, I was... and they were
having a hard time.

552
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,793
Did you feel like
it was bad enough

553
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:39,629
that someone needed
to go in and help?

554
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,932
I kind of trusted
that the people around me

555
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,734
would probably notice something,
and, if anything,

556
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,402
they would say something.

557
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:47,804
The way that you
interpreted the situation

558
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:51,041
as, you know, "Why isn't
anyone else doing something?

559
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:53,110
Then it must not be
as important for me
to do something."

560
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,911
That's
the bystander effect,

561
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:58,548
pretty much showing
the power of that situation.

562
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,784
 Ayamel did not
 act heroically.

563
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:02,419
 It was time to test
 a HIP student.

564
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,454
 Remember Courtney?

565
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:07,090
I would definitely be
the first person to respond

566
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,692
because that person
needs saving.

567
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:10,127
[happy chatter]

568
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,529
[man]
What is your tattoo?

569
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,664
Oh, it's fallopian tubes
giving the middle finger.

570
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:17,167
-[man] Oh, wow.
-[laughter]

571
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:19,569
-Seems like she's pretty
socially active.
-Yes.

572
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,671
Lisa, please,
a little bit of water.

573
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,874
[Lisa] If you stop talking,
you won't be as thirsty.

574
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,675
Why won't you
give me water?

575
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:28,078
How many times do I have
to explain this to you?

576
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:38,188
Every time you drink water,
you have to go to the restroom.

577
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:41,091
[Lisa] Hey,
how's it going?

578
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:44,728
He's being his regular
rambunctious self.

579
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:46,129
I need you--
I'm on the phone!

580
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,831
[gasps]

581
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:50,000
-Wow. Awkward.
-That's hard to ignore.

582
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,735
Hey, calm down.

583
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:53,203
[Barry] I'm calm,
I'm calm.

584
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:54,971
-Oh, she's getting up!
-Yes!

585
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:57,174
[Lisa] Look, I'm just
gonna have to let you go.

586
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,775
Yeah, for sure.

587
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:01,511
Bye.

588
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:03,447
I told you, whenever
I'm on the phone,

589
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,849
to not talk or do
anything like this.

590
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,986
You have totally lost
your water privileges
for the rest of the day.

591
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:12,656
-Why can't I have water?
-[gasps]

592
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,957
Why are you not
letting me have water?

593
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,926
[Courtney] Excuse me,
is everything okay?

594
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:16,760
[Lisa]
Yeah, everything's fine.

595
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,795
Would you like some
of my water, sir?

596
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:21,665
-I would like some water.
-[Michael] Oh, my gosh.

597
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,133
[Courtney] I will make sure
I find a supervisor

598
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:25,101
onsite for you, sir.

599
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:25,735
I'm very sorry,
that's all I have.

600
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:27,204
That's alright, thank you.

601
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,506
 Courtney displayed
 heroism today.

602
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:30,874
 Was it due to her
 HIP training?

603
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,175
My name's Elle.

604
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:34,578
I've been working with
Heroic Imagination Project,

605
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,812
and it looks like you
may have learned

606
00:23:35,813 --> 00:23:37,714
a few things
from your lessons.

607
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,649
Do you want
to tell us a little bit
about your experience?

608
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,718
You shouldn't be
a bystander, you know?

609
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,153
I just couldn't
let it it happen.

610
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,921
How did that affect
how you acted today?

611
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:47,591
It affected me 'cause
I made sure

612
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,993
I went up and said something.
I don't think I would have

613
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:52,128
if I didn't learn
from that project before.

614
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:54,664
Really? Courtney,
you are a hero.

615
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,233
Good work.

616
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,868
-Thank you, Courtney.
-Thank you.

617
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,135
Courtney's behavior appeared

618
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:00,904
to relate to her HIP training.

619
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:02,672
 Another HIP student
 was next.

620
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:04,774
If a situation arose,

621
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:07,210
I would definitely try
to be a hero if I could be.

622
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,612
Or at least I would find
someone who could

623
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,547
do something
better than me.

624
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:12,749
 But would Elija
 live up to his prediction?

625
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,784
No, turn around!
Turn around!

626
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:16,553
I need water!

627
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:18,755
What did I just say?
Turn around!

628
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:23,693
How many times I have to
tell you something like that?

629
00:24:23,694 --> 00:24:25,262
But I was quiet.
I was--

630
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,197
No, you weren't quiet,
and because of that,

631
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:35,539
you're not going to have
any water, okay?

632
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,973
-[man] All right.
-[Elijah] Let's go.

633
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:38,909
-[Michael] Strength in numbers.
-[Elle] Oh, very good.

634
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,177
He's our first person
to recruit confederates.

635
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:44,114
He is. He's also
the leader of the group.

636
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:44,815
Yes.

637
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,049
 Utilizing the "be the first"

638
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,751
 strategy from the class.

639
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,152
You want some of my water?

640
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:51,621
-That's fine.
-Thank you.

641
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:54,925
 So far, two HIP students
 have displayed heroism.

642
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,294
 Next, we tested a HIP student
 and a non-HIP student

643
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,129
 at the same time.

644
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,132
He's complaining
about water, as usual.

645
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,969
-He's complaining about...
-I'm not complaining.

646
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,972
After taking this class,
if I find myself in a situation

647
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,174
where someone would need help,
I find myself more inclined

648
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,777
to definitely step in
and step up.

649
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,112
 Would Jessica step up?

650
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:17,647
Stop complaining right now.

651
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:20,317
I'm not.

652
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,953
Really? Wow.

653
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,590
I need some water.

654
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,857
 Katherine and our actress

655
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:29,893
 both got up to give
 the man water,

656
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:37,167
 while the HIP student,
 Jessica, remained seated.

657
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,135
 Katherine didn't take
 our HIP class.

658
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:40,303
 Why did she intervene?

659
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:43,306
 And why didn't the
 HIP student get up to help?

660
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,642
Katherine, why do you
think you were first?

661
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:47,944
I'm Greek and Italian,
so...

662
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:49,012
You're not afraid
to step in?

663
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:51,247
No, not at all.

664
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:53,683
Jessica, you've been
through a program called HIP.

665
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:55,085
Yes.

666
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,953
Did you think
about that during this?

667
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,622
Yes, a lot.
I wanted to stand up.

668
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,924
I have really
pretty bad anxiety.

669
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:03,793
I am not a very
confrontational person.

670
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:05,629
Clearly the hero training class

671
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,931
 was not the only factor
 at work here.

672
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:09,866
 We ran the test
 several more times

673
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,201
 with a mixed bag of results--

674
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,904
 HIP students who helped...

675
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:15,505
Yeah.

676
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:16,272
She went looking for help.

677
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:18,274
 HIP students
 who did nothing...

678
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:21,845
 and non-HIP students
 who acted heroically.

679
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:22,946
I'm going to just ask him
if he wants some water.

680
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:24,881
[Elle]
She's doing it!

681
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:27,083
-What's he doing here?
-He's moving. All right.

682
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:29,285
Is he gonna secretly
give Barry water?

683
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:30,920
Yes, thank you.

684
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,123
 Our last subject
 of the day, Ruben,

685
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,758
 did not take the HIP class,

686
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,960
 and we decided to make
 taking heroic action

687
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:38,828
 as difficult for him
 as possible.

688
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:41,131
 We instructed
 our bystander actors

689
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,299
 not to react
 to the elder abuse

690
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,802
 or encourage Ruben
 in any way.

691
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,737
[Barry] I didn't have
enough water.

692
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:49,939
[Lisa]
We just got here, Barry.

693
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,907
-I know, but I'm thirsty.
-Could you stop complaining?

694
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:53,143
Just stop complaining.

695
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,377
I just need some water,
that's all I need.

696
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:56,112
Just a little bit of water.

697
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:57,580
[Michael] He's got
this piercing look.

698
00:26:57,581 --> 00:27:01,184
He's clearly paying
attention, but there's
just no emotion there.

699
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:04,187
 Yeah, and he's getting no
 feedback from the rest of the
 group.

700
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:06,356
[Lisa] You're making a scene
for no reason.

701
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,391
Hey, leave that alone.
Leave that alone.

702
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:11,227
I just want some water.
I just want a little
bit of water.

703
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:12,696
[Lisa]
Just-- Fine. Just relax.

704
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,931
[Elle] Despite
the remarkable
social cost

705
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:18,301
of getting up
in such a disaffected
group of people,

706
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:19,803
he did it.

707
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,671
If you don't want
to share the water,

708
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,073
I can give him my water.
That's fine.

709
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,975
-Is that okay?
-Wow.

710
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:28,712
Personally, if you
were taking care of
my parent like that,

711
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,015
there would be definitely some
lawsuits 'cause that's not the
way you treat somebody.

712
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:34,918
 With no training
and no support from the group,

713
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,853
 Ruben chose to be a hero.
 Why?

714
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,489
If I don't take action,
then nobody else will.

715
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,224
And I was like, I wish
I would have stood up sooner.

716
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:43,059
Now I feel like, in the future,

717
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,394
if I were to have
a situation like this,

718
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:46,162
I wouldn't even think twice.

719
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:48,498
 Scientists have
 studied heroism...

720
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,133
...and one thing
they have found

721
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:51,768
is that Hispanic and black males

722
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:53,303
are the most likely
to intervene.

723
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,371
Makes sense. Maybe
because of the background

724
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:58,441
we come from-- as a minority,
we have to defend ourselves.

725
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:01,010
And I think it's a subconscious
thing that we do.

726
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:02,846
I'm just shocked right now.

727
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,446
With flying colors,
might I add!

728
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:06,483
Thank you.

729
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,285
When it came to being a hero,
we found that the HIP class

730
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,387
 could only help
 to a certain extent,

731
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:14,457
 and individual background
 played a vital role.

732
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:18,161
 So, can heroic behavior
 be taught,

733
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,263
 or does it really
 boil down to personality?

734
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:23,399
Ideally, an educational
program like ours

735
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,469
should transcend
personality differences.

736
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,938
But practice makes perfect.

737
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:32,308
The key to heroism is
starting with very little steps,

738
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,278
try to do a good deed
of kindness,

739
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,180
and be willing to make
a bigger step.

740
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,315
We had a very small sample
size in our demonstration,

741
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,217
but we found that people
of color

742
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:44,354
were much more likely
to take action. Why?

743
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,089
If you're
a minority person,

744
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,158
the system is
usually your enemy,

745
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,527
so you can't say, Well,
the police will help,

746
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,996
or the government will help
or the landlord will help,

747
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,331
so it's me or no one.

748
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:58,935
And so, you're just
more sensitive to
people in need.

749
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:02,005
Mmm.

750
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,907
Not all heroes are the same.

751
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,542
The wisest course of action

752
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,977
won't be the same
for any two people,

753
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:09,445
but making it a habit
to look for opportunities

754
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:11,214
to be compassionate,

755
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:13,316
and stepping back to see
and consider

756
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:16,252
all available options
can be learned.

757
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:18,221
It's a skill
exercised like a muscle,

758
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,423
by repetition.

759
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:23,226
You don't have to wear
a cape to be a hero,

760
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:26,563
but if you want to...

761
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:31,167
that's okay.

762
00:29:31,168 --> 00:29:36,439
And, as always...

763
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,543
...thanks for watching!

764
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:42,981
