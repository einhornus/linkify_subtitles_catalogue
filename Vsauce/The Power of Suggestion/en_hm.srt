00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:12,677
[Michael]
 This is McGill University

3
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:14,479
 in Montreal, Canada.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,415
It boasts an enrollment of more
than 40,000 students

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,217
from 150 countries.

6
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:22,153
The campus employs
1,700 professors

7
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:24,489
teaching 300 programs
of study,

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,358
and it's proud to be home
to 12 Nobel Prize winners.

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,827
It is considered
one of the finest

10
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,696
research universities
in the world.

11
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:34,666
Recently, researchers at McGill
have embarked on a study

12
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:38,603
that uses a brain scanning
device to read people's minds

13
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:41,806
and implant thoughts
into their heads.

14
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,142
Or so their subjects think.

15
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:46,845
Now, the same device may be able
to help kids with ADHD,

16
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,614
anxiety,
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

17
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:54,519
migraines,
Tourette's and more.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,722
This study is not
about technology.

19
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:00,792
The MRI machine behind me
may look impressive,

20
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,260
but it's a sham.

21
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:04,628
It's deactivated,
nonfunctioning.

22
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,631
What this study
is really about

23
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:09,634
is faith in science.

24
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:19,377
It's about the power
of thoughts to heal.

25
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:24,883
All you need is the power
of suggestion.

26
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:37,762
[theme music playing]

27
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:40,865
A placebo is something
that shouldn't work,

28
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,168
but due to the power
of suggestion

29
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,571
and because of the strength
of our belief, does.

30
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:49,707
But we don't fully understand
yet how they work.

31
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,477
 There could be
 an evolutionary explanation.

32
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,213
 For example, if a small child
 hurts themselves,

33
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:58,750
 negative symptoms like pain
 and crying can be good.

34
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,519
 They keep the child safe
 and still

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,688
 while signaling adults
 to come help.

36
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,223
 When help arrives,

37
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:07,458
 even if it
 has no active effect,

38
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,826
 the child's brain may feel

39
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:11,262
 it has permission to redirect

40
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,298
 resources away
 from seeking help

41
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,667
 and onto actually healing.

42
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,570
 Modern medicine has found
 a way to harness this power

43
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,905
 by prescribing placebos.

44
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:23,508
But not all placebos work
the same.

45
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:26,477
For example, a sugar pill
will help your headache more

46
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:28,246
if given to you by a doctor

47
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:29,881
than by a poker buddy.

48
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:32,984
And the color
of the placebo matters, too.

49
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:36,287
A blue pill will work
to make you feel calm

50
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,889
better than a white pill

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,692
because blue
is a more calming color.

52
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,294
And a red pill
will keep you awake

53
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,596
and give you more energy

54
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,464
than a blue pill will.

55
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:48,900
A capsule will work
better than a pill

56
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:56,274
because it looks
more important.

57
00:02:56,275 --> 00:03:00,278
Also, an injection will work
better than a capsule

58
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,614
because it seems
more serious

59
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,482
and potent.

60
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:07,285
There's even evidence
that fake or sham surgeries

61
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:08,786
have positive effects.

62
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:10,521
It may be fake medicine,

63
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:12,523
but the effects can be real.

64
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:15,560
And not just because the patient
feels better psychologically.

65
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:17,729
We're talking
real physical healing,

66
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:27,939
thanks to the power
of the brain.

67
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,774
 I traveled to Montreal

68
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,342
 to meet local children
 struggling

69
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:32,877
 with debilitating behavioral

70
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,812
 and neurological conditions

71
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:36,981
 who would soon find out
 whether their afflictions

72
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:40,018
 could be cured
 by the power of suggestion.

73
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,719
-This is Malaya.
-Hi.

74
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,721
Malaya. I'm Michael.
Nice to meet you.

75
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:45,990
 Twelve-year-old Malaya
 suffers from a common

76
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,059
 skin ailment, eczema.

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,594
 But she has also developed

78
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:53,531
 a skin picking disorder,
 dermatillomania.

79
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:56,768
You're starting high school
what, like this year?

80
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,935
Early September.

81
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,071
Wow, that's a big step.

82
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,373
So, what kind of things,
like, worry you,

83
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,509
uh, given the symptoms
that you have?

84
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,511
Probably the picking.

85
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,879
-Of your skin?
-[Malaya] Yeah.

86
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,681
I don't know, I find
it satisfying to pick.

87
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,815
It's kind of gross.

88
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,317
Why do you think
you can't stop?

89
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,651
I'm not sure.

90
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:15,887
Have you tried
different things

91
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,455
that'll help you stop?

92
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,790
Yeah. Like, in my mind,

93
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,326
I'm just like,
"Today you won't pick.

94
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,328
You are gonna get rid
of this eczema."

95
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,063
And then after,
I'm just like,

96
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,465
"Oh, wait. My face is,
like, bleeding."

97
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,667
-Yeah. Is it embarrassing?
-Yeah.

98
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,503
I like to wear long sleeves
because my arms are, like,

99
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,972
if they're really bad,
I'm gonna try to wear
long sleeves.

100
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:37,508
How are your arms now?

101
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,012
It's, like, really bad.
So, as you can see--

102
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:42,347
And it's all just
from scratching and picking?

103
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
Yeah.

104
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,751
 Twelve-year-old Nicholas
 was troubled

105
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:49,487
 by debilitating
 migraine headaches.

106
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,489
So, what do you wanna
be when you grow up?

107
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,758
Like, I really,
really wanna be,

108
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,361
uh, probably like an NHL
or an MLB player,

109
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,762
one of those two.

110
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:00,631
 Nicholas's love of sports
 is unfortunately also

111
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,834
 the original source
 of his suffering.

112
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,435
Nice.

113
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:07,438
My first head injury,
which was concussion,

114
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,973
I hit my head
on a soccer post.

115
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,043
And then I hit my head
in a game of, uh, hockey.

116
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:15,613
Uh, after that, I had headaches
every single day.

117
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,548
I was throwing up,
having auras--

118
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:19,050
they're like, uh, colors

119
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,918
that you see before
you have a headache.

120
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,553
I wasn't able to go
to school,

121
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:24,522
and then we went
to the hospital

122
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,557
and into their
concussion program.

123
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,659
 Can I see
 his migraine chart?

124
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,029
Oh, sure. Yeah. We have
almost two years' worth.

125
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,898
Severe headaches here,
severe migraines.

126
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,501
-[Michael] Every day?
-[Danielle] Every single day.

127
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,904
This has turned
his world upside down.

128
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:42,907
 Nathan was diagnosed with ADHD

129
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,143
 and impulse control disorder.

130
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,578
I'd love to hear especially
about you, Nathan.

131
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,946
First of all,
how old are you?

132
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,648
-Nine.
-[Michael] Nine.

133
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,850
-How old you are?
-[Michael] How old
do you think I am?

134
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,453
-Thirty.
-That's a very good guess.

135
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,622
-I'm 31.
-Ooh.

136
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,658
So, tell me about, like,
before Nathan's diagnosis.

137
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,494
What were kind of the symptoms
you were seeing?

138
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:06,964
Tantrums all the time, um,

139
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:08,900
just an inability
to reach him,

140
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,068
to communicate to him,
to connect to him,

141
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,637
that was the main symptom.

142
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,806
And what did you
think of this, Nathan?

143
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:19,544
Were you like, "Why are
my parents not happy?"

144
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,546
-Why weren't you?
-[Nathan] I don't know.

145
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,749
Maybe because I have problems.

146
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,019
And as far as,
like, behavior.

147
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,821
Impulsivity,
hyperactivity,

148
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,722
and you're always,
always on the edge,

149
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,191
always stressed--
what is he gonna touch,

150
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,159
where is he gonna go,
what is he gonna do.

151
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,962
 These families had tried
 conventional methods

152
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:40,798
 to treat their children
 with little success.

153
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,834
 But they were about
 to find out

154
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,902
 whether their symptoms
 could be alleviated

155
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:47,805
 using an accessory-assisted
 placebo,

156
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:50,608
 a fake non-functioning
 MRI machine.

157
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,177
 This groundbreaking study
 of the power of suggestion

158
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:57,081
 and action is the brainchild
 of pioneering researchers

159
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:00,551
 at McGill University's
 esteemed Raz Lab.

160
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:02,653
We study a whole bunch
of different mind-body

161
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,155
interaction topics--
suggestion,

162
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:06,090
hypnosis, placebo effects.

163
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,527
Anytime the mind is regulating
the body or vice versa,

164
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:11,062
that's a topic
that we study.

165
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,030
Now, you said
the word "placebo."

166
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,967
And the device
that we are using

167
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,002
is a sham scanner.

168
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,770
 Tell me about
 the scanner.

169
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,273
[Jay] What we do
 with the MRI scanners is

170
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:26,277
we stack so many different
layers of deception.

171
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,713
In their head, this is
a proper neuroscience study

172
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,815
done at the neurological
institute.

173
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,016
And that's why we wear
lab coats.

174
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:33,150
That's why we have
all of this

175
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,752
scientific-looking
equipment.

176
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:37,054
By the time they've actually
started the study,

177
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,723
they've already in their mind

178
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,259
built up all these different
layers of credibility.

179
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,228
They really believe that
what we're doing is real.

180
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,631
[Dr. Veissiere] What's
interesting is that children,

181
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,866
they're not immune to the power
of neuroenchantment.

182
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,135
-Neuroenchantment?
-Neuroenchantment.

183
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,271
-What does that mean?
-So, it's this idea

184
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,740
that there is some kind
of medical magic.

185
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,209
There is immense power
that is attached

186
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,011
to the culture
of neuroscience

187
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,548
 whereby neuroscientific props
 and accessories

188
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,750
 have more healing power,

189
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,585
 more physiological effects,

190
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:10,288
because culturally
people believe that they do.

191
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,057
I mean, the same kind
of cultural cognitive mechanisms

192
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,693
are at play
in religious systems.

193
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:18,129
So, here we are praying
to the gods of neuroscience

194
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,830
and biomedicine.

195
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,233
Talk to me about
the ethics of lying.

196
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,935
The work we do
with children

197
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,836
actually does not
involve lying.

198
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,139
We tell them at first
that everything that they see

199
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,708
and everything that we do
in the lab is a suggestion.

200
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,210
We explain to them
that suggestion is a way to tap

201
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,146
into the power
of their mind.

202
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,815
We keep emphasizing even
as they go in the scanner

203
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:41,319
that it is their mind
and their brain
that is doing the healing,

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,156
that they're basically
reprogramming their own brain.

205
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,225
 The parents knew
that the scanner was a placebo.

206
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,127
 But for the study to work,
 the children

207
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:52,630
 had to believe
 in the procedure.

208
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:54,298
 So, before they visited
 the lab,

209
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,200
 I enlisted
 a few YouTuber friends

210
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,370
 to help raise
 their expectations.

211
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,671
[Veronica] Hey, guys.

212
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:03,007
Today, we have
a huge surprise for you

213
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,875
about something
brand new in science

214
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,043
that could affect you!

215
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,311
Oh, I know them.

216
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:08,813
 Well, today,
 we learned about

217
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,114
 this amazing new machie

218
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,616
 that teaches kids' brais

219
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,284
 how to heal super-fas.

220
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:15,286
 We really hope that you get
 the chance in person

221
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,988
 to see how
 this machine works.

222
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,122
With a little help
from the machine,

223
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,124
you can focus better,
be more confident.

224
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,259
-And it can even take away
some headaches.
-Awesome.

225
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,828
[Vanessa] Not too many
 people get the chance

226
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,830
 to have this
 awesome experience,

227
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,199
 but we hear
 the scientists in Canada--

228
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,067
-I'm going to have it?
-Yeah.

229
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:32,036
And it's very cool.

230
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:33,838
So, what do you hope
the machine

231
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,374
allows you to do
that makes you better at?

232
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,075
Better at concentrating,

233
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:39,844
better at focusing.

234
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,779
I wanna heal faster,

235
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,248
and this will probably
be a good idea.

236
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,717
I hope it heals me up
with my concussions

237
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:49,387
and then I hope
my headaches go away.

238
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:53,224
 I was about to take part
 in something remarkable,

239
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,827
 the very first use of
 accessory-assisted suggestion

240
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:59,797
on children with these kinds of
 symptoms.

241
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:03,134
Mind Field would play
 an integral role in the study.

242
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,402
 And the results could be

243
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:10,908
new and significant for science

244
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,843
 On the day
 of the first session,

245
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:15,012
 several measures
 were put in place

246
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,115
 to heighten the children's
 neuroenchantment.

247
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:21,252
-Nathan.
-Nathan, Nathan.

248
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,088
 A friendly fake nurse,

249
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,258
 a walk down a long,
 impressive hallway...

250
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,759
[sighs]

251
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,695
 ...and a ten-minute
 anticipation

252
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,698
 building wait
 outside the lab.

253
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,233
 Then it was time
 for their first scan.

254
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:37,702
Shall we?

255
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,704
 While the hypothesis
 of this study

256
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,905
 was grounded in science,

257
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,306
 this was Dr. Veissiere

258
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,008
 and Jay Olson's first time

259
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,343
 testing their theory
 on real children

260
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,112
 with real disorders,

261
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,914
 and they didn't know
 if it would work.

262
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,982
You may lie down
if you'd like.

263
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,185
 One of my roles was
 to help build up

264
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,188
 the children's belief
 that it would work.

265
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,258
As you go into the machine,
you'll relax more and more.

266
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,795
Would you like to relax
slowly or quickly today?

267
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:08,199
-Uh, I can go in quickly.
-Oh, wow, nice.

268
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,300
Very good.

269
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,235
 Although the MRI scanner

270
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:13,070
 was completely deactivated,

271
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,739
 we needed the kids to believe

272
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,275
 -it was fully functional. 
-[machine beeps]

273
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:20,878
 So Jay played a series
 of realistic sound effects

274
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,280
 to signify that
 the machine was working,

275
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,950
 while Dr. Veissiere
 planted the suggestion

276
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,852
 that it would help
 the patient heal.

277
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,222
You might notice
some unusual feelings,

278
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,823
perhaps a tingling.

279
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:35,159
Your brain
is continuing to learn,

280
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,429
and to heal,
and to help you find

281
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,166
this constant feeling
of confidence.

282
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,768
 If all went well,

283
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,936
 the placebo effect
 of the sham brain scanner

284
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,773
 would convince
 the children's conscious minds

285
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,142
 that real neuroscience
 was at work.

286
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,943
Take a deep, deep breath.

287
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:55,546
 This would allow
 their subconscious minds

288
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,481
 to harness the power
 of their brains

289
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,483
 to heal themselves.

290
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:01,819
For people with migraines,
it's often in the front

291
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,020
or the back part of the head,

292
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:04,355
but it could also
be like a feeling

293
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,223
like outside the head.

294
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:07,992
So I'm not sure what it's
gonna be like for you.

295
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,193
We'll find out afterwards.

296
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:11,862
So, we'll now slide you in.

297
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:13,330
Cool, it's like
a roller coaster.

298
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:14,899
I love roller coasters.

299
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,001
The deeper you go in,
the more you'll relax.

300
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,538
Okay. I wanna go
all the way deep.

301
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:24,375
[machine beeps]

302
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,511
I know. This is because you're
already at level three.

303
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:30,948
You might notice
that deeper feeling

304
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:33,818
of relaxation.

305
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,087
Yes.

306
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:44,328
Yes.

307
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,863
 The scientists at McGill

308
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,264
 believe that children's brains

309
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,499
 have always had the ability

310
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,467
 to control their symptoms.

311
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:53,070
 The children just needed
 to believe it themselves.

312
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:54,138
[machine beeps]

313
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,506
[sneezes]

314
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:59,210
Yeah. So the beeps can
sometimes make people sneeze

315
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:03,981
as a sign of their relaxing
just very deeply.

316
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:06,050
Right. Very well.

317
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,018
You did very,
very well, Nathan.

318
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,521
 The children all appeared
 to enjoy the procedure,

319
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:12,289
 and the researchers and I
 did our best

320
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,458
 to reinforce
 their neuroenchantment.

321
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,128
So when you heard
the first set of beeps
and the second set of beeps,

322
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:21,198
did you notice feeling
them in different parts
of your body?

323
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,133
Well, the first time
I went in the machine,

324
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:24,535
I kind of felt it here.

325
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:28,038
-Okay. Good.
-What level was
 she taken to today?

326
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,206
Level two.

327
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,408
-Level two.
-Yeah. Level two is great.

328
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,110
-Uh-hmm.
-Yeah.

329
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:35,145
When I was in the machine,
I felt like I was going,

330
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:36,647
like, backwards
and forwards.

331
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:39,984
Okay. That's very good.
That's a very good sign.

332
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,455
You might have noticed
how you were yawning.

333
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,623
That's great.

334
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,925
 For a kid
 with hyperactivity,

335
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:50,094
 Nathan was already
 appearing calmer.

336
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,997
 But before our young subjects
 left the lab,

337
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,132
 Dr. Veissiere
 bolstered the suggestion

338
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,368
 that today's session
 would help them

339
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,203
 continue
 their healing process.

340
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,171
[Dr. Veissiere]
So I know for sure

341
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,073
that you're gonna
be more relaxed,

342
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:04,909
much, much less anxious.

343
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,543
I would not
be surprised at all

344
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,946
if the scratching
really diminished

345
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,481
to no scratching at all.

346
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,650
The amazing thing
about the brain

347
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,986
is that it has
this fantastic power
to heal itself.

348
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:17,922
But now what we've
been able to do here

349
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,290
with the power
of suggestion

350
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,558
is to get your brain
to work faster

351
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,427
and better
all the time.

352
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:24,995
So how do you feel?

353
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:27,464
-Amazing.
-Oh, nice.

354
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:30,134
Mind Field
 provided the Raz Lab

355
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,636
 with Octopus
 by JOY smart watches.

356
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,038
[Nathan] Leftie rules.

357
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,539
 They were specially programmed

358
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,375
 to remind the children
 in between visits

359
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:40,644
 that their brain
 was healing itself.

360
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,446
[Dr. Veissiere] Just having
the watch with you

361
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:44,114
will make you feel better.

362
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:46,483
But it's not the watch
or it's not the machine

363
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:48,018
that's making you feel good,

364
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,187
it's your own brain.

365
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:52,723
 In six weeks,
we would return to the lab

366
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,725
 to check in on their progress.

367
00:14:54,726 --> 00:15:02,266
[dramatic music playing]

368
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,234
This high-tech contraption
is pretty much

369
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:07,604
what McGill University's first
sham brain scanner looked like.

370
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:10,274
It was an old discarded
hair dryer.

371
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,276
But the patients
didn't know that.

372
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:15,179
In the original study,
56 undergraduate students

373
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,181
were told that it was able
to reduce pain,

374
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,184
cause amnesia,
influence sexual attraction,

375
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,419
and produce various
other impressive effects.

376
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,990
 The lab's new, more modern
 sham brain scanner

377
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,458
 shows even more promise.

378
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,127
And I was invited
to participate in its test

379
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:36,467
on a whole new group
of adult subjects.

380
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,702
Okay, so you can come in here
and just grab a seat.

381
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:39,570
Yes.

382
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,006
These college students are fully
aware

383
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,608
of what's possible today with
neuroscience.

384
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,277
Could even they be
neuroenchanted enough

385
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,179
to believe in the impossible,

386
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,416
that an MRI scanner could read
their thoughts?

387
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,751
Now, we're looking
at cutting-edge

388
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,519
-psychological research.
-Okay.

389
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,589
Yes. It's part of the neural
activation mapping project.

390
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,690
We're gonna be putting
you in an MRI.

391
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:02,593
So, uh, it's a modified one,
it's called the CTMSF MRI.

392
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,462
-Okay.
-So, Combined Transcranial
 Magnetic Stimulation

393
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:07,431
Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging,

394
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:10,134
which is a big word just
meaning it can both read

395
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,403
-and influence thoughts.
-All right. Okay.

396
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,738
So, you'll be choosing
a number from 10 to 99.

397
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:17,608
-Okay.
-[Jay] And then
 from looking at your,

398
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,809
uh, neural activation
patterns,

399
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,477
Dr. Veissiere here
will try to infer

400
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:22,446
-which number you're thinking.
-Hmm, interesting.

401
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,747
-Okay.
-Okay, great.

402
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:26,784
 Most adults know
 the basics about MRIs,

403
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,586
 so we made sure to cover
 every detail.

404
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,423
In the scanner,
the magnetism is a lot less.

405
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,092
That's good
for documentary team;
they can bring a camera.

406
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,561
So, that said,
we do have to remove
the metal glasses.

407
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:40,264
-Got it. All this? 
 -After this realistic,

408
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,633
 but completely
 unnecessary step,

409
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:50,441
 it was time to begin our fake
 mind-reading experiment.

410
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,376
So, we're gonna start
the calibration.

411
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,211
So, try to stay
very still.

412
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,747
 Of course there was actually
 nothing to calibrate,

413
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,682
 but we were conditioning
 our subjects

414
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,684
 with the expected
 procedures, sights,

415
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:03,620
 and sounds
 of a real MRI study.

416
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:06,155
[machine sounds]

417
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:08,459
Okay. Think
of the number one.

418
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,294
 The subjects
 were asked to concentrate

419
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,828
on the numbers zero to nine.

420
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,431
 while the machine supposedly

421
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,333
 mapped parts of their brains.

422
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,867
Think of the number nine.

423
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,671
 Dr. Veissiere
 and I remained in character

424
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,673
 at all times,
 pretending to analyze

425
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,674
 the subject's brain activity.

426
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,410
 But the images on our screens

427
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:29,580
 were actually old MRI scans
 from former patients.

428
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,649
-Is the calibration good?
-Looks pretty good to me.

429
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,485
 With our subject now primed,

430
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,752
 it was time
 to convince her

431
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,721
 that the scanner
 could identify a number

432
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:40,557
 she was thinking of
 by reading her mind.

433
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:42,459
[Jay] You're gonna choose
a number from 10 to 99.

434
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,694
-Okay.
-You're gonna hear a beep.

435
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,362
Then you'll hear
a second beep.

436
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:46,763
So you're always
making your decision

437
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,198
-between the two beeps.
-Okay.

438
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,166
-Okay?
-Got it.

439
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:53,203
-So I'll slide you in.
-Mm-hmm.

440
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:54,271
[machine sounds]

441
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:56,607
[machine beeps]

442
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,210
[machine beeps]

443
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:02,179
So hold on to that number
for just a second.

444
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,814
-Okay.
-Um, uh, they're gonna print

445
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:05,582
-it out and then we'll see.
-Okay.

446
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,684
It was pretty clear--

447
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,419
 We pretended to give Jay

448
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,489
 the results
 of the MRI's analysis,

449
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,192
 but actually Jay was about
 to add the subject's number

450
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:17,895
 to the document
 with a little sleight of hand.

451
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,330
Okay. So you can stay lying
down just for a second.

452
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:22,399
-What was the number?
-Thirty-one.

453
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,700
Thirty-one. Uh, okay, cool.

454
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,235
So if you can sit up here.

455
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:26,737
What?

456
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,206
[Jay] But it's pretty close,
but it swapped, huh?

457
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,441
Yeah. Okay.

458
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,844
 That miss
 was actually intentional

459
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,846
 so that the results
 didn't appear to be perfect,

460
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,581
 adding to the realism.

461
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:39,216
So, um, are you
doing well?

462
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,450
We'll do-- we'll do
another trial with this.

463
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:44,221
The same thing, okay?
Slide you in.

464
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:45,722
[machine sounds]

465
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,925
 Michelle thought
 of a new number.

466
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,627
 Would the scanner
 get it right this time?

467
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,362
-Super clear.
-It's clear.

468
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:53,964
Really good this time.

469
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,466
[Jay] All right.
They think the signal is clear.

470
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,468
-What was your number?
-Twenty-seven.

471
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,704
Uh, 27, did you say?

472
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,239
-Twenty-seven.
-Oh, okay, great. Yeah.

473
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,674
So, uh,
if you can sit up here.

474
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,776
Yes. Oh, wow. What?

475
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,344
I don't understand.

476
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:09,313
Crazy.

477
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,715
-So, you chose 27.
-I did.

478
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:14,218
And the technician
thought 27 as well.

479
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,786
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah.

480
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,955
-[Michelle] All right.
-Oh, wow.

481
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,990
How does that feel?

482
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,726
Um, I didn't expect it
to be so specific.

483
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:24,695
-Yeah.
-Um, a lot of different areas

484
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,996
in the brain
could be lighting up

485
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,731
just to think of
the concept of a number.

486
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,766
 What do you know, it worked.

487
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,468
 Thanks to the wonders
 of science,

488
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,303
 or rather the skills of Jay,

489
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:36,673
 who in addition to being
 a neuroscientist

490
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:40,911
 happens to be a professional
 magician on the side.

491
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:43,614
 While Jay won't reveal
 the secret of the trick--

492
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,249
 the mind-reading illusion

493
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,950
 is very similar
 to the mentalist's tricks

494
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:50,487
that have entertained audiences
 for over a century.

495
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:52,556
 The only difference
 is that when audiences

496
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:54,725
 see the stunt performed
 in a magic setting,

497
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,393
 they think it's a great trick,

498
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,762
 not real science.

499
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:02,733
-The machine had 89.
-[laughs] That's cool.

500
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,369
 However, in the impressive
 scientific setting

501
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,571
 of the Raz Lab,
 these subjects thought

502
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,840
 our magic trick
 was real science.

503
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,775
-[Jay] Right here.
-Oh, my God.

504
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:14,478
 They didn't realize
 that the real science

505
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,813
 -they were experiencing... 
-It's pretty cool.

506
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:18,649
...was the power of suggestion.

507
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,916
Oh, wow.

508
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:23,353
A dose of neuroenchantment this
powerful

509
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:25,055
 can make for a formidable

510
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:27,391
and effective placebo.

511
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,426
I wanna talk about
the physical sensation.

512
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,061
-Sure.
-What was your experience?

513
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,663
It felt like a headache
was coming on.

514
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,765
It sort of felt
like, uh, like,

515
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,700
-tingling through my head.
-Up where?

516
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,635
Uh, just through this area,

517
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,937
like, this whole area
felt more like full.

518
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:43,307
I felt like,
uh, sort of, uh,

519
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,775
a pressure or something
like that.

520
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,743
It was, uh,
a strange feeling.

521
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:48,712
-Like, back here a little bit.
-In the back?

522
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:50,314
Yeah, a little bit
in the back.

523
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:54,718
Somewhere in the back
of the head? Interesting.

524
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,086
Oh, okay.

525
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:58,722
I wanna hear
what it felt like

526
00:20:58,723 --> 00:20:59,990
to have your mind read.

527
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,525
That was very strange.

528
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,527
I think I was
probably skeptical,

529
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,862
like, going into it,
and then I couldn't

530
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:07,798
figure out as I
was thinking, like, why--

531
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,466
how that would
happen otherwise,

532
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,668
and so, I'm just,
I think, in a baffled state.

533
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:12,803
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,671
 It was time to clear up

535
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,673
 this baffling mystery.

536
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:18,909
So, some deception
has been going on today.

537
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,879
Dr. Olsen is, uh,
not reading your mind.

538
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,481
Neither is this machine.

539
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,450
-This machine is deactivated.
-How? Okay.

540
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,618
All the noises
were coming from a speaker.

541
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,090
It was an illusion?
Oh, my God.

542
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,591
That's pretty cool.

543
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,528
Dr. Olsen is, uh,
not reading your mind.

544
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:39,963
-No.
-The sounds you're hearing

545
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:42,432
are not magnets,
it's just from a speaker.

546
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,968
The machine in there
is actually deactivated,

547
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,537
-it's not working.
-Wow, it's like placebo?

548
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:49,473
[Dr. Veissiere] Yeah, yeah.
That's exactly what it is.

549
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,109
Now imagine tapping
into this power
for other effects

550
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,144
-like healing, for example.
-Right.

551
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:55,479
Wow.

552
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,780
I definitely believe

553
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:59,683
the placebo effect
is alive and well.

554
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:04,821
♪

555
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:06,990
There's evidence
that the power of suggestion

556
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:09,693
even works on animals.

557
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:11,762
A study at North Carolina
State University

558
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,864
found that 86% of dogs

559
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,099
receiving real seizure
medication

560
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,768
had a reduction in seizures.

561
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,638
But almost as many,
a full 79%,

562
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:24,841
experience the same effect
from just a placebo pill.

563
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:28,745
And we don't know how a placebo
affects a dog's brain,

564
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,515
but it could be that dogs
have learned to associate

565
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,817
vet visits
and medicine from humans

566
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,085
with feeling better.

567
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:36,853
So, giving them a placebo

568
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:42,926
could help a dog's brain
heal itself.

569
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:45,996
[Dr. Veissiere] So first
I'll ask you to lie down again.

570
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,565
And of course,
you're total pro at this.

571
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:49,699
 For several weeks,

572
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,735
 the children
 had undergone sessions

573
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:53,970
 in the sham scanner
 at McGill University.

574
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,173
The body continues to relax

575
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:59,776
as we keep unleashing
this healing energy.

576
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,144
 Each time
 they were reminded

577
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,713
 that through concentration
 and relaxation,

578
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:06,650
 they were helping heal
 their own brains.

579
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:07,651
Here we go.

580
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,753
 Finally, after six weeks

581
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,988
 of receiving
 the placebo sessions,

582
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:15,459
 it was time to get a report
 on the results.

583
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,960
Malaya suffered from anxiety

584
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:19,830
and a compulsive
skin picking disorder.

585
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,200
 Had she experienced
 any level of success?

586
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,068
-It's good to see you.
-It's good to see you.

587
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:26,603
Go ahead
and take a seat.

588
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:28,672
You're wearing,
like, not even--

589
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,540
I thought maybe you'd
have short sleeves on.

590
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,709
You've just got
a tank top on.

591
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,979
Your arms look fantastic.
They've really gotten better.

592
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,081
And your face--
I mean, all of it.

593
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,016
Why do you think
you're better?

594
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:42,986
-I'm guessing it's the machine.
-Yeah, what about it?

595
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:46,056
Uh, I'm not really sure
how it works,

596
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,225
but I'm picking
a lot less.

597
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,894
Sometimes if I see,
like, a tiny flake,

598
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:52,162
I'll just leave it there.

599
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,698
That's a pretty
short amount of time

600
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,501
for such a big change
in the way you think
and behave.

601
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,735
That's awesome.

602
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,837
I don't really feel
the urge to do it

603
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:02,839
as much as I did before.

604
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,741
So it's a big improvement,
I guess.

605
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:07,644
Yeah, that definitely feels
like and sounds like

606
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:09,579
your brain
being powerful.

607
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,047
[Malaya] It's obviously
doing something

608
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,183
because my arms are better.

609
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:14,851
Well, you seem
a lot more confident.

610
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:16,219
Holding your head up higher.

611
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,287
Would you agree,
Anne Marie?

612
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:18,688
Yes.

613
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:21,124
She seems
less anxious.

614
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,793
She's more
positive overall.

615
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:25,128
-I was hoping for this...
-It's wonderful to see.

616
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,763
...more than this
to see her going.

617
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:29,566
Yeah.
Well, good work.

618
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:33,570
 And as for Nicholas
 and his migraine headaches...

619
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:35,572
-Hey.
-Hi.

620
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:36,707
It's good to see
you again, Nicholas.

621
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,276
Tell me about the procedure
and how you felt afterwards.

622
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,012
It accomplished all the things
that I wanted it to,

623
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,914
and, I haven't had
a migraine at all.

624
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,181
That's awesome.

625
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:48,051
And concentration is
a big thing that helped.

626
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:50,186
Wow. And can I see
the symptom charts?

627
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:52,289
-For sure.
-So these go back to February?

628
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,990
Yeah, well,
they're really telling.

629
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:57,160
And you can see not good,
lots going on.

630
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,996
But then recently,
no migraines at all.

631
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:02,566
-That's incredible.
-Yeah.

632
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,601
So, now, you said you went
to the neurologist?

633
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:06,169
They thought
it was quite remarkable.

634
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,905
He hasn't needed any,
uh, rescue medication,

635
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,240
he hasn't need the preventer,

636
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,709
um, and he's not
having migraines.

637
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,613
I'm actually really
excited for high school.

638
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:18,348
 Both Malaya
 and Nicholas attribute

639
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,817
 their improvements
 to the sham scanner.

640
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:22,586
 They believed
 it was working for them,

641
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,588
 and indeed, it did.

642
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,657
 So, how did Nathan,
 who suffered from ADHD

643
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:29,292
 and impulse control disorder,

644
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,361
 fare over the last six weeks?

645
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:33,763
 Well, I received a home video
 from Nathan's mother

646
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:36,633
 with an update on his progres.

647
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:39,603
So, um, the best part about
going through the treatment

648
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,238
was, um, just what
it did to our son.

649
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,240
 We noticed a difference
 in Nathan

650
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:46,042
 immediately
 after the first session.

651
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,611
And do you remember
what happened?

652
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,779
-I slept.
-Yeah. He slept.

653
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,049
Something he doesn't do
very often during the day.

654
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,784
He slept for two hours.

655
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:57,087
Um, he was refreshed.
It was just incredible to see.

656
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,256
And then what happened
was the entire summer

657
00:26:00,257 --> 00:26:02,058
we had him off the medicine,

658
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,259
and he did great.

659
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,795
He thought about stuff
before he did it,

660
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:08,031
we were able
to talk things out,

661
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:10,033
and, uh, it's been fun.

662
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:12,969
So overall, we're
very pleased and, you know,

663
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,938
we just-- we had such
a great experience,

664
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:17,741
so thank you very much.

665
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,909
 The children's results
 are encouraging,

666
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,146
and a powerful sign of how
effective suggestions,

667
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,749
and our willingness to believe
them can be.

668
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,119
In time, the kids will
understand how all of the power

669
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,056
was within them, and not in the
scanner.

670
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:35,358
This work is
truly cutting-edge.

671
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,826
This hasn't
been done before.

672
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,195
Correct.
We also think of this

673
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:42,065
as a great new way
to do science
and to collaborate.

674
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,401
 So much more of the public
 will see what's being done.

675
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:48,038
Yes. Science isn't just
about publishing a paper
that nobody reads.

676
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,673
It's about spreading
the ideas that you find.

677
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,975
-Hundred percent.
-As far as I'm concerned,

678
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:53,309
you're already
a co-author

679
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,745
in our scientific
experimental paper.

680
00:26:55,746 --> 00:27:03,987
Wow, very cool.
Thank you.

681
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:06,690
The children's improvements
were caused

682
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,124
by the placebo effect,

683
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,161
and no deception
was used to mask that.

684
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,897
The parents knew
the machine was deactivated,

685
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,832
and the children
were only told

686
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,168
that it had the power
to put a suggestion

687
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,303
in their brain, a suggestion

688
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:23,273
that ultimately came
from themselves.

689
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:26,209
But surely, the more people
learn about placebos

690
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,745
and their lack
of intrinsic power,

691
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:31,247
the less effective
they'll be, right?

692
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:32,449
No.

693
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,417
Studies show
that even when subjects

694
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:37,020
learn that their treatment
was a placebo,

695
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:40,123
the positive results
do not go away.

696
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:41,725
What the subjects have learned

697
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,326
about how to heal themselves

remains with them.

699
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,031
It was an honor to have been
a part of this study.

700
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:50,900
I think this is Mind Field 
at its best,

701
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:53,036
using our resources
to help researchers

702
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:55,205
with their work
and helping the public

703
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,974
see how the brain is studied.

704
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:00,043
Placebos can't fix everything,

705
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:03,046
but these kids
always had the power

706
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:04,280
to start healing.

707
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:05,515
All they needed

708
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:08,785
was the power of suggestion.

709
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:13,289
And as always,
thanks for watching.
