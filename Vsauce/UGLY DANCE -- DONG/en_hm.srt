00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:03,979
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
I'm still in San Francisco.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,269
I was hanging out with Jake from the Key of
Awesome, but he just left to go to the

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,038
Big Sur,

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,388
so yeah, I'm alone hanging out with some
art and uhm,

5
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,109
well, doing my laundry. But it's okay, because I did
some research and found some things you

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,558
can do

7
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,739
online now guys. As a bonus we've got a
special guest coming up,

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,009
who helped me do some research this week.
Rinry from RinryGameGame. She does

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,038
really great video game history
episodes that are quite Vsauce-y.

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,448
Let's have some fun.
First things first, Cat Mario

11
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,509
is so difficult it's hilarious.
But Class 3 Outbreak.com

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,699
lets you create and play zombie warfare maps anywhere

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,919
in the world, even your own backyard,
using Google Maps.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,169
qKirbyp recommended Draw a stick man,

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,939
as did a lot of you. Why?
Because this game is super creative.

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,009
You draw your own character
and the game animates them.

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,209
You have to draw items and solutions to
get them through the story.

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,859
Now, when you finish, celebrate like
weeMAN1300 by doing

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,889
the Ugly Dance.com.
You can upload your own photo here,

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,437
give yourself some real time moves and
even share your dancing self with a

21
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:05,139
unique

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,429
URL. As you know, I've been traveling and
it's been difficult

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,839
for me to research the DONGs that
you guys deserve. But luckily,

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,978
Rinry from RinryGameGame,
right here on YouTube, whose channel

25
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,469
I love, has come in to save the day.
Here's an added bonus.

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,249
Rinry has the cutest voice on YouTube.
Don't believe me?

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,508
Well, guess what, she's right behind me.
Hey Rinry, how do you doing?

28
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:30,548
Hey Michael, I'm Rinry.
I'm not gonna say much

29
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,029
right now, because my voice hurts, it's broken.
Fortunately

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,149
for you guys I recorded
the voice-over couple of days ago.

31
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,179
Awesome. Now here's the part
that's really mind-blowing though.

32
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,199
If you hear her voice, I'm the exact same age

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,118
as her. Yeah, can you believe that?
Maybe someday I'll do an episode on aging

34
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,359
and free radicals and whatnot, but in the
meantime, Rinry, give us some DONGs.

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,719
Here they are.
Just like the NES, the

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,728
Internet has provided us with a wealth
of side-scrollers. Parasites gives the life of

37
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,069
parasitic creature

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,019
the side-scrolling treatment. There are colorful
landscapes, funny looking creatures

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,738
and so much jumping to be done.
Thank you, sadlyzombiebait.

40
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:13,439
Discover every pixel, The Small World, in
a side-scrolling adventure sent in by

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,389
louswebsite.

42
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,878
Five small worlds to uncover and just one
small jumping stick to do it.

43
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,869
If you've been typing all day and just wanna
relax those aching fingers,

44
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,708
sit back with Wonderputt.
This mini putt course builds

45
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,909
itself as you play and all you have to
do is click and drag that mouse to

46
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,679
guide the ball past maze like

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,939
obstacles.
Guide the blue ball to the red ball

48
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,458
in 3D maze, the rotating puzzler sent in
by LyricQueen1231.

49
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,869
Neon Maze is a cop above colors for you
to contest as quickly as possible.

50
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,539
Guide your color coordinated buddy with your
mouse to beat each level.

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,449
Just not interested in winning anymore?
You can't win in Triangulate,

52
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,829
but you may get addicted to manipulating
triangle, just like myself and

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,859
alltehstuffs did.
Man In the Dark has an

54
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,039
unlikely addiction to your mouse. He'll follow your
cursor around the window

55
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,029
and his body can become almost elastic in
need to keep up with it.

56
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,469
Did you think this man was alone in the dark?
Click again.

57
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,669
If you just don't feel like focusing on
what you're doing

58
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,749
the Disagreeing Internet will help.
The way it refuses to stay still will guarantee a

59
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,359
lack of focus on any task.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,878
The Hacker Typer will allow you to
appear to be intensely focused on

61
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,548
hacking

62
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,649
while actually typing whatever gibberish
you want.

63
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,999
Just press F11 to full screen the
page and pretend to hack like a pro.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,079
Thank you so much for doing that Rinry.
I didn't have enough time this week to

65
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,969
research as many DONGs as I wanted to,
but you came through in the clutch

66
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,449
and that makes you saucy in my book.
Click here to check out her channel

67
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,229
and maybe later on do something
different for a change.

68
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,429
Do nothing for two minutes.com

69
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,469
That's right. You win by doing nothing.
As soon as you do something, you loose.

70
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,048
It's kind of a fun concept, so check that one out.
Subscribe to Vsauce if you haven't

71
00:03:59,049 --> 00:03:59,619
already.

72
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,819
And as always,

73
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,040
thanks for watching.
