1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,778
This is what heaven is like.
And things just got a little too real.

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:09,869
It's episode 38 of IMG!

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,599
Okay, so this is Katy Perry

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,709
and this is Paula Deen.
Uh-oh.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,649
Because this is Tom Hanks and this is 50 Cent.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,519
Coincidence? Here's a caterpillar whose
pattern resembles

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,209
little penguins.
And what if Obama was a white guy?

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,739
Crystal e-mailed me a picture
she took of a cooler lid that says

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,929
'wow, look at them jugs.'
But, onto the dessert.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,619
"Freakgirl" makes beautiful cupcakes,
but the pun award goes to her

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,119
'Up-cakes.'
Parents can be scary,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,619
but this picture is one of the most
terrifying I've ever seen.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,738
Can you make sense of this

14
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,769
shape? What is it?
And in these next two pictures

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,269
can you find the faces?
And that's right, you guessed it,

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,449
it is now time for 99 pictures of bananas.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:09,089
Enjoy them all.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,339
Here's an artist who meticulously cuts
paper with an exacto blade to make

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,228
swirling portrait out of a single

20
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:17,789
sheet.
And here is a giraffe licking a squirrel.

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,809
How about a panda on a rocking horse?
Or face paint a famous paintings?

22
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,389
Warhol, Pollock, 'The Scream,'

23
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,559
Magritte, 'Starry Night.'
Pocky box delivers realistic South Park families

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,879
and Mario delivers

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,069
any performance-enhancing drug you want,
because now

26
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,368
you're swimming with portals.
Hello?

27
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,618
Ooohh.
Baby hands are delicious,

28
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,689
but after the town of Kolmanskop, Namibia was abondoned wind and sand

29
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,478
re-claimed the homes,
leaving these eerie desert rooms.

30
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,898
Also eerie are underground neutrino detectors.

31
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,279
Eerie and very, very large.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,459
You can like us on Facebook to show off

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,519

34
