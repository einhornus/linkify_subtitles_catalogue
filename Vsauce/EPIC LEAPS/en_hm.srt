00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,049
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and today,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,709
in honor of Leap Day, I would like to
talk about leaps.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,429
What's the largest leap a living
thing could possibly take?

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,439
And how does the fact that life can leap

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,569
possibly give us evidence that you, me, and all of us

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,069
are actually aliens?

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,609
Well, in 1903, the Wright Brothers

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,699
became the first humans to fly

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,949
in an airplane, and then a mere 66 years later,

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,329
we were already landing on the moon.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,329
Neil Armstrong's giant leap for mankind

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,959
may have been a small step for him,

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,419
but let's put these two events in perspective.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,429
The Wright Brother's original flight was so brief

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,339
and low, it could've completely occurred

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,929
inside the external tank of the space shuttle.

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,269
What I'm getting at here is that going from the very first airplane

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,889
to us landing on the moon only took 66 years.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,609
But to get from the invention of the motorcycle

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,529
to the very first successful backflip on a motorcycle

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,739
didn't take 66 years.

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,119
No, it took nearly 120.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,789
The first successful backflip done on a full sized motorcycle

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,539
didn't happen until the year 2000,

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,589
and it was accomplished by Kerry Hart.

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,509
Now, since then, double backflips and even
triple backflips have been done on motorcycles.

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,759
But according to calculations done by
extreme sport physics,

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,889
no matter how much better riders get,

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,009
with the current power motorcycles have,

30
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,809
you will never be able to do any more than
four back flips in one jump.

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,109
Extreme sports in general are excellent
for demonstrating physics—

32
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,569
for instance, your center of mass.

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,029
Your center of mass is a point in space

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,449
where your mass is concentrated.

35
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,419
It's where your weight as caused by gravity acts from.

36
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,869
Now, humans have a surprisingly high
center of gravity,

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,629
which makes it possible for
magicians to do tricks like this one.

38
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,679
The concept of a center of mass

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,849
also explains why a skateboarder can
increase his or her speed

40
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,179
on an incline just by changing how
tall they're standing.

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,179
It's also the reason you can pump your legs

42
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,769
to swing higher in a swing.

43
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,479
What you accomplish by pumping your legs on a swing

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,779
is an elevation of your center of mass above

45
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,319
where your body actually is.

46
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,489
Now, because gravity acts at that point,

47
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,199
you're going to swing back down as if you were

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,949
higher up than you actually were.

49
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,329
So you gain more and more acceleration each time.

50
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,589
Geometrically speaking,

51
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,209
the center of the lower 48 states

52
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,919
is near Lebanon, Kansas.

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,429
But this is where things get heartwarming.

54
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,919
If you were to cut out the lower 48 states

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,719
and then take that shape and figure out how to balance

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,889
it perfectly, you would find that the center of mass

57
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,319
for the United States is a town in Nebraska called Friend.

58
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,649
Back to leaps, here's a question you may have asked yourself

59
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,949
while watching certain movies, could a snow boarder

60
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,909
escape an oncoming avalanche?

61
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,859
Well, in 2007, Popular Science Magazine said no.

62
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,209
But technically, you could.

63
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,459
Extreme sports physics points out that
Galileo showed that when friction and drag are low,

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,669
gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate.

65
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,209
So while it's possible, it wouldn't
necessarily be safe.

66
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,509
But when are extreme sports ever safe?

67
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,519
If you want to get really unsafe,
let's go back to Joseph Kittinger.

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,979
I've covered this guy in lean backs in the past.

69
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,979
He's the guy who back in 1960 as part
of a government experiment

70
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,949
jumped off of a weather balloon
102,000 feet above earth,

71
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,449
so high up that you can see the back of space.

72
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,119
But within the next few years,

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,199
Red Bull may have something hidden up their sleeve.

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,029
It's rumored that Kittinger himself
may be advising an upcoming project

75
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,039
with Felix Bongardner where Felix will dive

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,669
not from 102,000 feet up, but 120,000 feet up.

77
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,759
The difference here is that Felix will be jumping to earth

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,969
actually from what we consider space,

79
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,139
and during his fall, he will literally

80
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,519
break the sound barrier.

81
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,479
His body will travel faster than sound.

82
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,278
He will become the first human
to break the sound barrier

83
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,488
with their body.

84
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:35,778
Earth's gravity loves to pull things down towards it.

85
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:41,368
But the gravity we experience here on the
surface is just one gravity,

86
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:44,368
one g—it's what causes us to weight what we weigh.

87
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:48,708
But when we accelerate, we experience more than 1g.

88
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:52,418
When the world record for the most
air achieved on a snow board occurred,

89
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,718
the snowboarder himself
experienced four to five g's at the base of the ramp.

90
00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:02,678
Meaning that momentarily, his legs each
had to support 700 pounds.

91
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,848
To put this in perspective, astronauts aboard

92
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,978
the space shuttle experience a peak of only 3g's.

93
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,858
More than 5g's experienced for an extended period of time

94
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:16,238
can easily be lethal.

95
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:19,368
Enter the euthanasia coaster.

96
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:24,498
It's a roller coaster designed
to kill the people who ride it.

97
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:28,498
The first drop accelerates you to more than
200 miles an hour.

98
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:35,208
And these loops are built to provide a constant
10 g experience for one full minute.

99
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,668
It's estimated that no human being

100
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:41,928
could even survive past the first
two loops. Why?

101
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:45,018
Because 10 g's exerted that way

102
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,678
would pull blood away from your brain,
starving it of oxygen

103
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,898
resulting in brain death.

104
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:53,268
And that's just 10 g's.

105
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,988
If you were to ride on a bullet,

106
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,278
you would experience a peak g force

107
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,528
of 190,000.

108
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:05,368
That means that your body would weigh
190,000 times more

109
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:07,618
than it does stationary on earth.

110
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,868
But here's where things get muddy.

111
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,538
Japanese researchers have found bacteria

112
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,338
that not only survive, but thrive in an ultra centerfuge

113
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,928
exerting not 190,000 g's,

114
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:24,388
but more than 400,000.

115
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,678
The implications here are mind blowing.

116
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:29,518
We already know that some single celled lifeforms

117
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,848
can survive in extreme conditions.

118
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,898
Just this morning, I was reading
one of Bill Bryson's books

119
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,948
about how we have actually found dormant,
but viable bacteria

120
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,198
trapped inside cameras

121
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,618
left for years on the moon.

122
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:49,248
If simple life forms can also survive
incredible g-forces,

123
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:54,868
that means that the entire earth was blown
up by an asteroid, life as we know it

124
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,208
might not be over.

125
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,298
There may be simple life forms that could

126
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:03,338
survive, dormant, traveling through space

127
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,848
only to land on other planets
billions of years in the future.

128
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,338
In fact, who's to say that a similar process

129
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:13,188
isn't what brought life here to earth?

130
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:16,768
It sounds crazy, but the entire concept has a name:

131
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,728
Panspermia.

132
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,448
Let's keep things grounded and stick to earth.

133
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,408
Specifically, extreme sports.

134
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:30,498
I had all these leap thoughts lately because
I've been working with really cool extreme sport channels—

135
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:36,038
new ones—here on YouTube including Ride with Tony Hawk, Ally Sports, and Network A.

136
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,708
If you like extreme sports, you should definitely

137
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,048
check these out, they've even got special messages
just for you.

138
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:45,048
So, have fun, cherish the leap day,

139
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,219
and as always, thanks for watching.
