1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,909
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Love

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,979
and war are exactly alike. It is lawful

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,699
to use tricks and slights to obtain a
desired

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,159
end. But is all fair

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,159
in love and war? That's a good question,

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,619
let's pencil it in for

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,349
this episode.

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,159
Of course, pencil is not permanent. It can
be erased.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,469
It's not like whatever I write down is
being chiseled into granite.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,179
But pencil lead is made out of carbon

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,089
atoms organised into a structure called
graphite -

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,429
a nonmetallic mineral with some metallic
properties found naturally

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,579
in rocks, which means things written in
pencil,

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,029
though erasable, are still technically
written

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,519
in stone. In video games

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,099
if the bad guys really wanted to stop
you, why did they walk around in such

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,639
predictable patterns?

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,999
Wouldn't their chances be better if they
just came right at you?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,109
There's a great name for this logic:

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,029
"mook chivalry". It's as if there's a sort of

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,859
unwritten Geneva Convention that applies
to fictional baddies

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,389
that respects not reality, or what would
make sense,

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,649
but instead the higher purpose of fun,

24
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,889
and a good story. But in real life

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,929
we aren't that much different from the
mooks.

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,329
We construct voluntary obstacles in the
way

27
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,929
of even honourable goals, like truth, justice,

28
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,629
or right over wrong. Not all is fair

29
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,089
in love and war. And it's the exceptions
that make us who we are.

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,269
Torturing your enemies to

31
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,819
get information from them, to demoralise them, or just for

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,169
fun has been a "might

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,599
is right" part of war since war began.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,959
But in the second half of the 19th
century, Henry Dunant,

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,219
the founder of the Red Cross organized
an official moral code

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,379
of warfare - The Geneva Conventions, that
today

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,679
across it's now 4 conventions has been
agreed to be followed

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,299
by 196 nations. And since then

39
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,269
various other customs, codes and
principles have been established

40
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,579
totaling up into what may now be called
the "Rules

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,559
of war". Their enforcement is handled
by regional,

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,659
national and international powers. Of course,

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,019
an unconcerned force would simply ignore
these rules

44
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,299
because the quickest route to victory is
the one full

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,469
of unfair advantages, but nonetheless

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,869
we treasure them. Try to, at least. And
believe that all

47
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,109
others should. The values they recognise

48
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,349
are telling. Things unrelated to military
necessity,

49
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,439
or valued in a sense, more greatly than
immediate victory

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,049
are protected. For instance, The
Environmental Modification Convention

51
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,609
prohibits controlling the weather and
using the

52
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,279
weather as a weapon against your
opponents. Before the convention

53
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,569
that happened. For example, during
Operation Popeye

54
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,139
US airplanes seeded rain clouds over
Vietnam

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,109
and successfully extended the monsoon
season by more than a month,

56
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,349
increasing rainfall by 30 percent - a move
that made enemy road surfaces muddy,

57
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,539
blocked by landslides, washed out, much

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,899
less passable. The laws of war protect
certain symbols.

59
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,319
Parties or infrastructures bearing
symbols that indicate there are

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,159
only there to help, or are neutral,
culturally important buildings that

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,139
should be protected for posterity

62
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,859
are off limits.

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,598
It's a violation of the laws of war

64
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,889
to attack such targets or to pretend to
be such targets

65
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,409
if your intentions are otherwise.

66
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,299
That is called perfidy. A kind of
deception that involves

67
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,848
pretending to act fairly and honestly to
invite the confidence of an adversary,

68
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,449
only to then take advantage of that
trust, betray it

69
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,818
and kill, injure or capture.

70
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,047
If you do one of those three things
while pretending to be dead

71
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,239
or injured or surrendered or civilian or
a non-combatant,

72
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,138
well, that's a violation of the rules of war. Espionage

73
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,819
is allowed. But if caught, you can be

74
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,149
prosecuted and punished. Whereas if you
are a lawful combatants on the other

75
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,519
hand you're entitled

76
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,719
to protection as an official
prisoner-of-war.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,749
Conditions like these reveal something
we desire to hold

78
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,038
above quick vengeance: dignity and
respect.

79
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,069
Both sides wish to be treated with that
and

80
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,099
uphold the bargain. Athletes agreed
to play fair,

81
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,709
to avoid prohibited things, even
technically safe and

82
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,168
otherwise legal things that would
nonetheless give them

83
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:07,019
an unfair advantage. They do this because
the spirit of the sport

84
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,069
is more important to them then the quickest

85
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,728
victory possible,

86
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,019
sportsmanship. Likewise, a sort of

87
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,519
"lovesmanship" exists in US court rooms.

88
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,429
If the most sure-fire way of getting
the truth of someone's guilt

89
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,049
involves spoiling a bond of love. Spousal
privilege

90
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,668
says chill. Love is sacred. Truth

91
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,058
will come second, find another way. So,

92
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:38,579
if you are planning on committing crimes
in the US,

93
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,359
and you need an accomplice, marry them.

94
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,778
Your spouse can not be forced to testify
against you.

95
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,908
There are different privileges applying
to other

96
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:52,388
relations of yours, allowing them to
refuse to give evidence

97
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,008
against you. These rules exist to honour
something that we deem, or

98
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:02,489
like to deem, greater than easy victory.
You cannot travel faster

99
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,569
than light.

100
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,169
Or escape from a black hole. Or commit
perfidy

101
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,629
in a time of war. Or cheat on your
significant other.

102
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,439
That's usually considered unfair,

103
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,999
but the final two aren't physical
limitations of matter.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,459
They are voluntary obstacles reflecting

105
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,209
what we value. Whether we respect those
values, or not, is another story.

106
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,469
And how we interpret what actions are over
the line and what aren't

107
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,469
is a matter of judgment. We didn't get to
create

108
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,869
protons or planets - they were already
here.

109
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,069
But we do get to create judgments.

110
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,419
We even named ourselves after that
ability.

111
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,779
We call ourselves Homo sapiens. 'Homo'
meaning

112
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,659
hummus - the soil, we are from the earth.
'Sapien' mean

113
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,219
sapiens, the ability to make wise
judgments.

114
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,419
Very few people would argue that all
truly is fair

115
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,729
in love and war, but in love and war

116
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:06,069
behaviours otherwise not acceptable can
be not only forgiven,

117
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,589
but recommended. Reading messages not
meant for yourself,

118
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,909
using disguises, even murder can be
downgraded to a

119
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,349
crime of passion or lawful combat.

120
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,539
But love and war put different things at
stake.

121
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,799
And just because unfair things are
expected during love

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,479
and war doesn't mean that within their
respective domains

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,289
we prosecute or prohibit unfairness in the same way.

124
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,919
Violating the law of war is a crime

125
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,309
but there is no official law of

126
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,289
love.

127
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,979
You can prosecute someone for perfidy, or
desertion,

128
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,369
or weaponising the weather,

129
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,829
but you can't prosecute cupid for heartbreak.

130
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,279
You can't have someone arrested for not
loving you back

131
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,409
and you shouldn't call 911 if someone leaves you

132
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,389
for someone else.

133
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,549
You see, there is no Geneva Convention
for love.

134
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,299
Furthermore, we often route for friends
or

135
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,569
fictional characters who follow their
hearts, even if it means leaving someone

136
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,099
we

137
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,498
care less for -

138
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:15,068
a minor character for instance - alone or
stranded

139
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,499
at the altar.

140
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,859
Does this mean that love is a better
excuse for bad behavior

141
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,219
than war?

142
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,279
Obviously not for criminal behaviour, but
otherwise?

143
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,149
As far as authoritative powers and our
modern conception of love

144
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,509
are concerned,

145
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,989
war - its technologies and strategies are
human invention.

146
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,639
Whereas love

147
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,898
is a human condition.

148
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,348
Love is like inertia or death - inevitable.

149
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,368
A law of nature and blameless,

150
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:49,898
if unkind. We legislate where a bomb can fall,

151
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:54,058
where debris can fall and prosecute
those who violate those rulings.

152
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,888
But we don't prosecute gravity for
making

153
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:02,368
things fall. We support voluntary
restrictions on

154
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:05,789
fair play in sports more - public etiquette.

155
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,388
But the players in love's battlefield are blameless

156
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,479
victims of their passion, even if those
passions

157
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,548
are nonsensical. The heart has its
reasons,

158
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,909
which reason knows nothing of. Deceiving
others,

159
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:26,508
that is what the world calls a romance.
Maybe love has this power intrinsically or

160
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:29,528
maybe we give it that power by
leaving so

161
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,528
legally alone. But either way,

162
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,719
broken bones are the domain of law.

163
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,638
Broken hearts are the domain of 'aww',

164
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,009
'shucks',

165
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,529
'sorry'. And as always,

166
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,000
thanks for watching.
