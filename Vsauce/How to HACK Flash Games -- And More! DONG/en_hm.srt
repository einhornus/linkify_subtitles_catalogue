1
00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:04,449
Dang it. This is too real. I want something I could do

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:10,159
online now guys. DONG.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,959
Let's start things off with a Tetris

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,499
Overload. 'Muse13NJ' showed me this first person

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,619
Tetris.
When you turn a piece, so does your perspective.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,679
It's fun, but 'Dixavd' would rather
prank you with Portal Tetris.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,189
Ah, you know, this isn't going to end well.
Or, really,

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,479
in debt all.
'LeatbouldersTV' brought us Tetris

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,229
Laps, where just like Mario Tetris you
arrange blocks to make the level

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,269
more navigable. Now, as you play, you unlock each next level.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,449
But you could just cheat like 'BloodsailAdmiralTdk'

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,659
who showed off ArcadePreHacks.com, where you can find flash games you like to play

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,059
except all the levels are already
unlocked right off the bat. 'MrDeagleking'

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,109
blew my mind

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,238
with browser pong.
Why play with moving dots and

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,169
fixed part of your window, when you can play with windows.

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,569
But now, let's toogle like 'tanos1998.'

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,068
This search engine takes a word you give it and makes a picture of that word

19
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,728
using the word itself.
For science,

20
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,039
check out the periodic table of videos
where the University of Nottingham gives

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,829
you a video

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,868
with info and experiments for every element.

23
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,059
Not enough about you?
'AliRex27' recommended

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,359
a site that takes your name and displays it as

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,319
elements. 'Vince8745' brought us this simple beauty
of a game called

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,228
'And Everything Started to Fall.'
In this game you climb through your life

27
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,779
to survive.
And as you survive you actually grow up -

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,279
first to child, then a teenager, and so on.
Wo...wait.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,408
How quickly can you type the alphabet?
'Thecheatlord999' showed me this guy

30
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,828
whose work is awesome. His planetarium
lets you pick a region of the world,

31
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,118
click through time and then check out
where the Moon will be,

32
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,489
what phase it'll be in, you can even mouse over a star to get its information.

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,798
And if you own 3D glasses like these,
check out his

34
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,389
anaglyph drawing tool, where you can draw
pictures on the screen itself

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,658
and then navigate around in
three-dimensional space.

36
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,778
On the manly side is 'JakeGordonTV's' message

37
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:13,089
about balls dropping. This chrome
experiment lets you draw lines to bounce

38
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,058
falling balls

39
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:18,318
right inside your browser.
Finally, trip out with 'misterturtle1998's' suggestion

40
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:18,668
for

41
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:24,558
this game that scares me.
But that's not all.

42
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:28,089
On Friday I'm gonna have a brand new
episode of Vsauce Leanback.

43
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,869
It's going to be a really fun one.
But right now, go check out Kevin's little piece of

44
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,348
investigative journalism

45
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,619
about everything you need to know about jetpacks.

46
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,519
It's awesome, subscribe to our channels.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,668
And as always,

48
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,009
thanks for watching.
