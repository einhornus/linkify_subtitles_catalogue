00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,669
Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,889
And this video is to tell you that I released
a brand new Vsauce leanback - a playlist of

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,749
some of my favourite videos from all over
YouTube, with me hosting in between.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,729
You can only really watch it on a computer,
so if you're on a mobile device or something

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,418
else weird wait until you're in a better position
to lean back.

6
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:29,569
To make it worth your while, in this video
I've got news, a fact and math.

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,809
Three things.
First of all, the news item.

8
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,199
Hazel.
Vsauce t-shirts.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,719
Let's try to act a little bit more mature.
Vsauce t-shirts.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,659
We've got the logo,
we've got brains and here's the fact.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,279
Are you ready?
For this one drop some knowledge and hear

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,479
some order happen.
You're not using this take, are you?

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,689
Baby... Baby carrots are made out of adult carrots.

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,849
No!
Weird adult carrots, they shave them into

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,709
the little baby carrots that we know.
But they just, it just stops growing and it's

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,599
a baby carrot.
No.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,089
They take adults, especially ugly adult carrots
that look weird and they shave them into good shapes.

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,329
I don't know, dog food or something.
But wait a second.

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,779
Baby corn really is baby corn.
It's normal corn and they don't let it grow

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,799
to adulthood, they kill it when it's a kid
and then they serve it to you and you eat

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,759
it when it's still a baby.
That makes me feel better.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:30,079
Now it's time for some mathematics.
Okay, first of all, it does not matter at

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,949
all what order the cards are in.
This is completely a mathematical trick.

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,108
So anyone can do it and there's no slide of
hand involved.

25
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:41,008
I'll shuffle it, so I can just prove that
to you.

26
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,188
All we need are 9 cards.
One, two, three.

27
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,428
One, two, three.
One, two, three?

28
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:52,298
Three, very good.
Now, pick a pile that you fancy.

29
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,708
Alright, now choose a card out of that pile.
You can look at them all, yeah.

30
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:00,158
Okay.
Okay, now you can totally show me what it

31
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,579
is, 'cause it's a math trick.
So put it right on top.

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,379
Three of diamonds, good choice.
Now, what I'm gonna do is take the rest of

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,878
our 9 cards and stick them right on top.
The rest of the deck, all this whole mess

34
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,439
thing here, doesn't matter.
Get it out of the way.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,059
Now, because of the range of numbers of letters
in every single card's name and because your

36
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,988
card is the third from the bottom, three of
diamonds, this will always work.

37
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:27,928
Let's spell out your card's name.
Three of diamonds.

38
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:32,529
T. H. R. E. E.
Rest on top.

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,018
What's the next word?
Of.

40
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:38,179
O. F.
Rest on top.

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,009
Diamonds.
Spell it out for me.

42
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:46,419
D. I. A. M. O. N. D. S.
Rest on top.

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,699
Okay.
Now.

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,488
Okay, are you ready for this?
Yes.

45
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:59,399
Alright, now what I want you to do is say
the phrase "Hazel is really super awesome."

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,419
Okay.
Okay?

47
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,238
Uhm.
As I drop a card you say a word.

48
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,599
Okay.
Hazel is really super awesome.

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,099
There's your card.
No way!

50
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,679
That'll work every single time.
Try it at home.

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,068
I learned it from mismag, a magician I've
included in the leanback before.

52
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,658
I put an interactive trick of his in this
leanback, it's a long one, you're gonna learn

53
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,568
a lot of different stuff that goes all over
the place, it's gonna pack your brain with

54
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,218
knowledge.
Alright?

55
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,438
It's gonna all covered in Vsauce when we're done.

56
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,079
So start than leanback.

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,939
And as always,

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,419
thanks for watching.

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,340
Bye.
