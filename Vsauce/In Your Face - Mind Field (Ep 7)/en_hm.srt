- Okay, great, guys.

178

Then, when you're ready,

179

a debrief with Mr. Stevens.

180

- Sure.

181

Now, think about, um,

183
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,915

and taking a photo of them.

184
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,116

- And how you felt.

185
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,751

186
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,753

that task.

187

are extremely cute.

188
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,856
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Can I keep one?

189

 Is it cool with you guys?

190
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,059
- The dogs actually cooperated
pretty well.

191
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,160
 - Mm-hmm?
 - I was able

192
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,662

193

197

199

How did you feel
while you were doing that?

208
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:50,328
- Um, a little frustrated,
to be honest with you,

209
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,263
'cause they kept moving around.

210
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:54,298

getting them to stay in place

211

the photo taking task?

213
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:00,371
- Mmm, 4.
- About 4.

214

- A 10.
I love puppies.

215

- Still a 10?
- Yeah, me too.

- It was sort of unexpected, but
it wasn't like it bothered me.

- That part is innate.
Absolutely it is, no question.

with our faces, in the interest

 many people pay to be injected

 our faces mute,

 or rather, gives us a sort

384
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:57,521
 Botox was first used
 in the 1970s

385
00:15:57,522 --> 00:16:00,624
to treat muscular eye disorders
 like crossed eyes

386

 The active ingredient in Botox
 is a toxin

 produced by the bacterium
 Clostridium botulinum.

391
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,208
 This toxin can cause botulism
 in larger amounts,

392

 but in smaller amounts
 when injected into, say,

 eyebrows or around your mouth,

you were thinking
of getting it done.

400
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,530

- Okay.

403
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,268
- I'm 31 years old,

and I want to get Botox because
I want to look young forever.

405
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,341
 - Common expressions
 that people want to get rid of

406
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:55,145
is the angry lines, the furrows
we get in between the eyes.

407
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:57,481
 And the horizontal wrinkles
 we get in our forehead,

 that will go away.
 - If the Botox procedure

409
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,586
 prevents these patients
 from being able to mirror

 the facial expressions
 of others,

411
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:07,491
 will it also impede
 their ability to recognize

412
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:11,194
 the emotions associated
 with those expressions?

00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:13,430
- Have you had Botox before?
- I never have.

00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,164
- Do you wanna touch everything?
- If we can, yeah.

- Yeah, definitely.
- Awesome.

416
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,736
I think Botox is probably
going to change my expressions

417
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:22,639
and I might have to overdo them
a little bit,

418
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,174
 but I already do that anyway,

419
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:27,578

so much.

Did you intend to be
like a Ken doll or...?

443
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:19,930
- No. I mean, initially--
initially this all had to do

with the passion that I had for,
like, body sculpture, right?

445
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,636
I just did what I loved,
and I saw this as a medium

446
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,571
to be--to be creative,
to be open,

447
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:28,939

and to be different,

448

 emotions correctly.

517
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,900
 But after Botox,
 our participents

518
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:14,938
correctly identified only 73.8%
 of the positive emotions

519
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:19,042
 and 68.8%
 of the negative emotions.

520
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,977
 So, at least
 in our modest sample,

521
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:23,847
 once our participents
 lost their ability to frown

522
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:25,749
 they found it
 especially difficult

523
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,453
 to identify negative emotions
 in others.

524
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,823
 But if modern advances
 like Botox can impede

525
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,925
 our capacity
 to read other's faces,

526
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,828
 can other forms of technology
 enhance our ability

527
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,497
 to see emotions?

528
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:43,900
 Author and theoretical
 neurobiologist Mark Changizi

529
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:47,804
 has developed a scientific way
 to read facial expressions.

530
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:51,575
Mark, I'm glad you came over,
because you have knowledge

531
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,478
about facial expressions
and what's going on

532
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,980
beyond just the more obvious
external stuff.

533
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:00,751
Is blood flow part
of facial expressions?

534
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,753
- Yeah, so we don't
usually think about it,

535
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,621
but at all times you're seeing

536
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,623
these subtle modulations
of color.

537
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:09,059
And as you get more blood
or less blood under the skin,

538
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,862
 it becomes bluer or yellower,
 and as it becomes more

539
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,397
 or less oxygenated,

540
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,965
 it becomes redder or greener.

541
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,633
 And this is true independent

542
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,101
of what ethnicity you are,
what race you are,

543
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:20,604
or what kind of primate you are.
It's the same.

544
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,606
- What emotions correlate
to what colors?

545
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,841
- Well, there's a rough sense
in which when you're angry,

546
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:26,877
 you're showing
 oxygenated blood.

547
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,445
 When you're sad,
 it's more likely

548
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,046
 to be showing greener.

549
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:31,848
 If you're fearful,
 your blood pumps away

550
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,016
 from the periphery,
 which means

551
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:34,818
 that it gets yellower.

552
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,653
- So, Mark, you've brought
some tools with you,

553
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:39,022
an invention of yours,
actually, that helps us

554
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:42,459
better perceive
these color changes.

555
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,494
- That's right, so these
are what paramedics wear

556
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:45,962
'cause they're nice,
protective eyewear

557
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:47,564
that they should
be wearing anyway,

558
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,433
 and when you wear these,
 your veins,

559
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,001
 suddenly they're glowing
 a little bit.

560
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,603
 The same technology that helps
 paramedics see veins

561
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:55,138
also allows you
to see emotions better

562
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:57,140
because it's enhancing
that same oxygenation signal

563
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:58,742
that those emotions rely upon.

564
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:01,111
- So you've got glasses
that allow us

565
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:05,582
 to better see the colors
 that are related to emotion

566
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,117
 and how it's affected
 by blood flow.

567
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:08,952
- That's right.
This is not the kind of thing--

568
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,787
it's not like you look
and it says, "angry,"

569
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:12,155
you know,
written across the screen.

570
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,057
No, it works on your
normal intuitions.

571
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:17,227
The idea is that it makes
those signals easier to see,

572
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:18,829
so it should give you
more insight

573
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,098
into what their mood,
what their intent is.

574
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:24,768
 - Whether through technology
 or evolution,

575
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:27,070
 we humans have always found
 a way to read

576
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,206
 and use facial expressions.

577
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,475
 And those expressions
 show no sign

578
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,577
 of becoming less important,

579
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:38,148
 unless we evolve past
 having faces, of course.

580
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:40,717
So, did you like the show?

581
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:43,487
If you didn't,
put a pencil in your mouth

582
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,088
and go watch it again.

583
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,624
If you enjoy it more
or less or the same,

584
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,025
just let us know.

585
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:51,228
Science will thank you.

586
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:59,870
And as always,
thanks for watching.
