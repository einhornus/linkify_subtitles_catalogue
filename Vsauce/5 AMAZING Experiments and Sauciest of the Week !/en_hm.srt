Hey, Vsauce. It's Michael with two big
announcements.

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:07,409
Count them two. First of all, there's a brand new
episode of Vsauce Leanback

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,888
that you can start by clicking the link
at the top of this video's description.

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,368
This week the topic is crazy and classic
social psychology experiments.

5
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,269
Three years ago I was at the University
of Chicago studying psychology.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,528
I mainly did neuropsychology, but it was the social stuff,

7
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:26,788
the social experiments, that really were fun to watch.

8
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,678
So I went head and went through YouTube and put
together some of my favorite taped

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,559
experiments.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,609
A lot of these are actually very very
classic and have been very important to

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,049
understanding how we act

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,589
around other people.
Speaking of other people,

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,009
we have a brand new "Sauciest of the Week."
Remember that Sauciest of the Week is

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,679
given to a member of the community,

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,709
a fellow WeSaucer who's done something cool,

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,439
whether it's just a simple awesome
comment, a great recommendation for a

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,689
website or a game

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,259
or if they made something or made a video that we think we should all see. Now,

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,968
each week the winner is determined by
last week's winner

20
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,419
and last week the first one was chosen
by myself - I picked sofusser.

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,169
Well sofusser got back to me and said that this
week's winner should be roadhousee.

22
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,899
Why? Because of this video he has about goats

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,249
climbing up a steep wall.
Saucy!

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,758
Roadhousee, if you're out there, get
back to me about who you think from the

25
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,899
WeSauce community should win next week

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,519
for doing something awesome or having
something cool you think we should see.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,508
But seriously, what are you waiting for?
Click the link at the top of this video's

28
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:31,199
description to start lean back.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,559
If you're on a phone, as you know,
it won't really work yet,

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,719
so wait until it's a better time or if you're really impatient,

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,059
I did put links to everything I cover in
this video's description.

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,459
So, have fun...

33
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,919
And as always,

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,320
thanks for watching.
