1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,378
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
What

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,139
are monsters?
Scary,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,449
unnatural things?
Yes,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,359
but they're more than that and we knew
that back when we named them.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,429
The word monster comes from the same root word

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,399
as demonstrate and demonstrative, monere,

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,739
meaning to teach, to instruct, to warn.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,979
Monsters, like dinosaurs, 
and the stories we tell about them,

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,049
have a lot to tell us about ourselves,

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,238
about the past and about the future.

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,218
This Vsauce1 video is not an ordinary video,

12
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,578
it is a dinosaur-dnary

13
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,659
video, built not just out of me talking,

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,738
but also world-famous palaeontologist 
and technical adviser to

15
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,448
every Jurassic Park film, Jack Horner, and

16
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,009
the hilarious Chris Pratt.
First things first,

17
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,398
scientists have so far broken Earth's
history down into 22

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,209
periods.
The Jurassic period has come and gone,

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,459
but the one we live in today is called
the Quaternary.

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,309
Jurassic World is the movie that you're in.
Yes.
The thing that we're filming right now

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,399
Quaternary World.
Quaternary World.
We are organisms from the Quaternary.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,798
Quaternary Park would be, well,
basically like Universal Studios or something.

23
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,059
Exactly. Actually, literally any place on Earth right now.

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,759
Dinosaurs,

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,489
fossils.
Yeah.
Dinosaur, fossil.

26
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,809
Fossil, fossil fuel.
Wow.
Is it safe to say that

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,779
our cars run on the ghosts of dinosaurs?

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,579
That question sounds mind-blowing,

29
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,269
but is it true?
Are we really fuelling our cars

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,179
with dinosaur remains?
Well, I asked paleontologist Jack Horner

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,889
and his answer is worth beginning from
the bottom or rather

32
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,539
from things that come out of bottoms.

33
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,179
You'll see what I mean.
Okay, so this.

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,428
Let me guess what this. Okay.
Yeah, it looks like coal almost. Well, they are, it's

35
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,139
actually a coprolite.
What's a coprolite?

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,739
Fossilised dung.
Dung?

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,749
Oh, so this is plant material that was eaten

38
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,059
Eaten. Turned into poop. Yes.
And then preserved

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,869
so that I could hold it today.
Yes, exactly.

40
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,559
That's a dinosaur poop.
This is dinosaur poop.

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,309
Yes. It smells like a rock.
Sometimes when we break open

42
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,459
somebody's things that are... that have a...

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,859
have a very high concentration plant
material you actually can smell it.

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,239
Really? Uhm.
What does it smell like?

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,249
Mmmh, rotting wood.
After this long

46
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,509
it still has an odour of rotting?
It can, yes.

47
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,319
So, we can probably learn a lot.
We can learn more

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,639
about the dinosaur from that right there
than we can from the bone from its

49
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,738
body. That is amazing.
Because we can determine,

50
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,869
we can determine exactly what it was

51
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,029
eating and and and we can

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,159
look at how it's chopped up, so you can tell a lot about

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,819
exactly how they process the food.
So, from the

54
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,299
scientific perspective of learning
about dinosaurs, poop

55
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,339
is not crappy at all.

56
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,029
Yes.

57
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,029
Thanks for laughing at that. 
Now, at any point would that turn into

58
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,689
oil?
No, oil does not come

59
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,109
from dinosaur poop.
Does it come from dinosaurs at all?

60
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,208
It doesn't come from dinosaurs at all.
They come from microorganisms and

61
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,059
oceans.
If you took all of the dinosaurs that ever lived

62
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,689
and... and, you know, squished them up

63
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,899
in order to get the oil out of them,

64
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,299
we'd probably go through that oil in,
you know, couple of days.

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,318
No kidding(!)
I mean the microorganisms from the ocean,

66
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,488
from the oceans over these millions of years

67
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,329
produced... I mean, the biomass is just incredible.

68
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,949
Compared to the dinosaurs.
So there could be a tiny

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,098
molecule of oil in every thousand gallons or more

70
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,409
that's from a dinosaur.
No,  you really not even gonna...

71
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,349
That's not even going to happen as well.
Basically, all of the oil reserves we have

72
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,918
are in

73
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,269
in sedimentary rocks, produced in oceans.

74
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,529
So we don't put dinosaur ghosts into our cars,

75
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,949
but don't feel lonely.
There are actual living dinosaurs

76
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,609
with us today. There are dinosaurs still around today.
Dinosaurs

77
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,649
never went extinct.

78
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,629
What? Elaborate, alright, fine I will.
So, dinosaurs...

79
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,279
Yeah, that's what I meant.
Dinosaurs are not a species, that was called a clade.

80
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,939
They're from the clade dinosauria.
And the clade is just some

81
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,939
organism and all of its descendants.
Okay. Okay? Dinosaurs came in all different

82
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,799
types, right?

83
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,199
All of these things were called dinosauria

84
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,299
and then a huge extinction event
happened, 65 million years ago.

85
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,499
Yup.
Giant rock hit Earth and like

86
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,788
almost all of them, all the ones, died

87
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,258
except for

88
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,219
a few. And you know what this one was, 
this little branch? That's what clade means, by the

89
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,228
way - branch.

90
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,989
Aardvark. Aardvark. No?
Uhh,

91
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,079
I do. I know what it was.
What? Halibut.

92
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,829
Just for the halibut I will say

93
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,218
correct. That's a dumb joke,
that's a joke that's been made a bunch.

94
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:41,829
I've never heard it before. Really?
You just said "halibut" like

95
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,279
"hell of it." Yeah. Yeah. Classic.
Now figure this trout.

96
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,079
Wow.

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,579
Dude.

98
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,399
The answer is birds.

99
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,799
Technically birds aren't just descended
from dinosaurs, they literally

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,128
are dinosaur. Exactly. You know, 
to determine how things are related to one

101
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,718
another we look at the characteristics
that they share

102
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:06,778
and when you think about birds and the
characteristics that we think

103
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:09,989
of as being bird characteristics,
they are feathers,

104
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,239
hollow bones, the wishbone,

105
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,769
you know, you can go on and on,
but those are just a few of them

106
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,278
and it turns out dinosaurs have
them as well, so

107
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,279
dinosaurs had these characteristics before birds.

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,609
The hypothesis is that birds

109
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,619
are the dinosaurs.
The meteor impact that killed off the dinosaurs

110
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,278
didn't kill off all of them.
It killed off then

111
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,508
what we call the non-avian dinosaurs and

112
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:42,709
the avian dinosaurs we still have with us.
In Jurassic World,

113
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,818
the park's decision-makers create dinosaurs

114
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,959
that have appearances that bring in

115
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,188
tourists, not appearances that are
historically accurate.

116
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,188
For example, they didn't put feathers on
any of their dinosaurs, although it is

117
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,998
believed that many dinosaurs

118
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,039
had

119
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,959
feathers. It's believed that the
velociraptor probably

120
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,469
actually looked more like this.

121
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,049
And as far as the reality of creating a
park like Jurassic World,

122
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,169
Horner had this to say.

123
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,999
Everything about it is fictional, we can't bring dinosaurs

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,799
back by cloning them.

125
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,499
If we make dinosaurs, which,

126
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,409
I hope we are able to do one of these
days, it will be retro engineering from a

127
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,019
bird,

128
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,439
in other words going backwards from a bird.
They're still going to be fictional

129
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,459
creatures because

130
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,579
they're not going to be historical dinosaurs.
They'll be

131
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,379
things we made.
They'll be things we make, yeah, that's right.

132
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,789
Why are we so thrilled by the idea of bringing back

133
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,379
un-extincting non-avian dinosaurs?

134
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,039
You know what?
That actually brings up an even bigger question.

135
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,589
Why are dinosaurs so fascinating to kids?
Dinosaurs

136
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,699
are terrifying and we love to be scared,

137
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,019
but Dracula and ghosts

138
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,819
and all this stuff, 
it's a little, it's a little not real.

139
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,239
But dinosaurs? We've got their fossils.
Right. You know?

140
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,049
We've got the fact that, no, these really
were on Earth, they really were walking

141
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,949
around right here.

142
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,429
Why is it so awesome when they flip out
and start killing people?

143
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,449
Watching something flip out and kill
people is thrilling.

144
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,859
It's morbid curiosity, but the more intense the

145
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,459
flip out, the more exciting it is to see the flip

146
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,269
undone, to see humans prevail

147
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,649
in the end.
No matter how beastly

148
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,158
and huge dinosaurs were,
the fact remains that they

149
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,158
went extinct.
They are a reminder that

150
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,009
sooner or later the universe will beat

151
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,949
everything.
A meteor impact, like the one that

152
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,869
killed off all the non-avian dinosaurs
will happen again

153
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,579
in about the next 100 million years or
so, but we might stand a fighting chance.

154
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,889
We have technology and we have the ability to predict,

155
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,389
and possibly even avoid,
a similar fate involing us.

156
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,069
Outer space may seem distant

157
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,229
and sometimes irrelevant to pressing earthly concerns,

158
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,039
but let's not forget what Larry Niven said,
"The dinosaurs

159
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,299
went extinct because they didn't have
a space program."

160
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,599
And as always,

161
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,820
thanks for watching.
