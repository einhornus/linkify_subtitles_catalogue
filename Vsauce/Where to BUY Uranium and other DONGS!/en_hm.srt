Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And over the weekend I was in Los Angeles,

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,169
where I got to meet up with Henry,
the creator of MinutePhysics.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,749
But let's get to some DONGS.
MinutePhysics recommended

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,649
Grow Cube. You win by selecting the
elements in the correct

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,519
order. I was kinda like big deal,
but then MinutePhysics pointed out

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,549
that understanding the subtle relationships
between the way the animations happen

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,848
and way the items interact is something
that the human brain is

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,899
awesome at, but computers not so much.
These's are one of the few types of games

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,119
where people can be computers. So go play
one, and after you beat it, look at the

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,999
screen and go

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,859
"take that computer."
SnipeZzLeGacY recommended Continuity,

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,808
a really clever game where you have to
rearrange the puzzle pieces

13
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,238
of the game to make it playable. And 'No
One Mourns the Nolan' recommended Blow

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:50,889
Six,

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,179
where you shoot balls at bricks to knock them
off, but using larger and larger balls

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,479
costs you points,

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,159
so be careful.
NothinbatHD sent me "Kill Me."

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,169
New versions of yourself appear
over and over again

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,188
and the bodies of your former selves can
be strategic safe zones.

20
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,449
DeluxeFreeman sent me the best type of koala,

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,109
the kind you have to laboriously wave
your cursor over and over and over

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,839
to divide into small enough pixels to
be intelligible.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,459
KryptiCxLeGenD threw me a curveball

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,749
3D pong.
And oh look, a complete breakdown of

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,978
10 codes. 10-4 means OK, but there are 98 others.

26
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,298
Htwins.net contains some of my favorite WebWork.

27
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,429
These are the guys behind the amazing scale
of the universe tool I've covered before,

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,499
but they also have spatial intelligence
games like

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,889
rolling a cube, so that a certain
face faces down at the right time.

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,728
I also like this one where the guy can't
walk and you have to pre-plan

31
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,029
his automatic route. Joe Sabia is one of
the most creative people I know. His

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,819
internet works

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,039
are super clever. I specially like how he
made this interactive game

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,249
on Facebook.

35
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,849
Bob Lazar was a guy who purportedly
worked at Area 51.

36
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,589
What does he do now?
Well, he runs UnitedNuclear.com,

37
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,299
a website where you can actually buy
small,

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,949
legal quantities of radioactive
isotopes/

39
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,989
Finally @GothisLifeStyle @tweetsauce-d
a fantastic list of cool

40
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,659
mind hacks, like the Pinnochio effect or
the fact that you can not rotate one of

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,919
your feet clockwise

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,309
while simultaneously drawing the number
six in the air

43
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,569
without having to reverse your foot.
Pretty weird, right?

44
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,329
And as always,

45
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,450
thanks for watching.
