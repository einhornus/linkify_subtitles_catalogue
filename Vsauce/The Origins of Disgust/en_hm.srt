1
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:12,177
Being impressed by the cognitive
abilities of a chimpanzee

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,113
isn't just good for them,
it is good for us,

3
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:18,716
because it helps us learn about
our own evolutionary history.

4
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:23,321
Comparing the psychology
of humans to the psychology
of other primates

5
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:28,760
is a great way to
illuminate what it is we
maintained, lost, or changed

6
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:31,496
as our brains diverged
from other primates.

7
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:35,767
Now, I'm really excited
right now, because in
the spirit of sharing,

8
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:38,269
The Primate Research Institute
has agreed to show me

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,605
some of the other ways
they're learning about us

10
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:45,176
by studying those
who are almost us.

11
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:47,278
 I'm heading to the
 parasite lab to meet up

12
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,647
 with associate professor
 Andrew McIntosh

13
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:51,816
 and doctoral student
 Cecile Serabian.

14
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:55,453
 Their work with
 Japanese macaques has
 led them to theorize

15
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:58,623
 that primates' feelings
 of repulsion or disgust

16
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,860
 could have served a protective
 purpose in our evolution.

17
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,796
 To study disgust,
 we will be working with

18
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:09,701
 one the most famous
 disgust inducers: poop.

19
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,737
Andrew, Cecile, thank you
for meeting up with me,

20
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:18,209
I can now tell people that
my time in Japan was crappy.

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,077
[both chuckle]

22
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,879
[Andrew] Just like
every day for us.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,515
So tell me, why is there
a bunch of poop on the table?

24
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,851
Because we were studying
the social behavior

25
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:29,220
and parasite infection
of the macaques.

26
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:34,492
[Cecile continues]

27
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:43,902
Right.

28
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:47,472
If we want to say that humans
are somehow especially hygienic

29
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:52,443
or disgusted by those kinds of
objects that might make us sick

30
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:54,946
It's quite difficult
to separate whether that's

31
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,448
an evolutionary
response to something

32
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:00,618
or just a cultural
phenomenon that we've
kind of created on our own.

33
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,355
[Michael]
Now these are clearly toys.

34
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,657
They're made of plastic.

35
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,926
These look
kind of different.

36
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,528
Okay, so you have different
types here on the table.

37
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,630
This is the type
for carnivores--

38
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,199
it's not the type of primates.

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,402
Primates have a long-shape
type of poop.

40
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,237
It's called type 9.

41
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:21,272
-So those are all--
-Wait, poops have numbers?

42
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:24,209
-[both chuckle]
-I only know number 2.

43
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:34,419
Why make play poop when you
have plenty of chimps out there
giving you real poop to use?

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,456
Ah.

45
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:41,693
-So there's no odor
or texture here.
-Yeah, exactly.

46
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:46,231
And what differences
did you see?

47
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:56,507
[Cecile continues]

48
00:02:56,508 --> 00:03:07,385
Ah, so it's like a surface
to put the food on top of.

49
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,721
-They would avoid the replica?
-Yes.

50
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:14,926
[Cecile continues]

51
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:17,996
[Michael]
Oh, really? Right, right.

52
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,366
If you expose a bunch
of individuals to a range
of different kinds of

53
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,835
avoidance experiments
we found that

54
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,337
those individuals that
are much more hygienic

55
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:28,473
actually were exhibiting
lower infection, so...

56
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:32,443
It sounds like a really
strong argument in support
of the idea that we

57
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,679
evolved an emotion like disgust

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,449
- or a behavior like avoidance
of infectious-looking stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,052
-Because it had an advantage.

60
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,687
-You get infected less.
-[Andrew] That's right.

61
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:44,956
So you have some kind
of experiment for me?

62
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,724
-Yep.
-Is it safe?

63
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,727
-Let's see.
-Don't play that way!
-[all laugh]

64
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:54,899
 Cecile and Andrew wanted
 to show me just how hard-wired
 our sense of disgust is.

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,469
[Cecile] There you go.

66
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,704
Okay. Those are edible?

67
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,773
-Yes, those are edible.
-Mm-hmm.

68
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:07,011
-I'm just going to place one
in each of the holes here.
-Okay.

69
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:10,515
If you are ready to eat them,
just try to reach out for them.

70
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:17,388
Okay.

71
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,857
Okay. Good. Good.

72
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,527
What do I do once
I pull the treat out?

73
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,697
You will tell us
whether you are ready to
eat it or not, basically.

74
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,465
Oh, okay.

75
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,067
-So, you'll put one in there.
-One goes here.

76
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,868
Sure.

77
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:33,905
-One goes here...
-Okay.

78
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,940
And one goes there.

79
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:40,078
All right, I'm going to
start right in the middle.

80
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,049
Hmm. All right, so I might just
blow on this before I eat it,

81
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,951
but I feel pretty
ready to eat it.

82
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,721
-Yeah?
-Because what I felt was dry,

83
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,658
and it was solid,
it was like a foam.

84
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,160
Watch.

85
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:59,564
-Okay.
-Oh, it's really good.
It's got kind of a coffee taste.

86
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,032
So far so good.

87
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,102
I'm going to go to the left.

88
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,804
No, I don't want this one.

89
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:09,907
-Okay.
-Whoa, you still went for it.

90
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,709
I still pulled it out.

91
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,444
[sniffing]

92
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:15,079
What was it?

93
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,850
So I'm just going
to set it down. Okay.

94
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,720
Alright, it smells...
it's kind of fishy.

95
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,456
All right, now...

96
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:28,526
[chuckles knowingly]

97
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,062
I... okay.

98
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:35,066
I'll tell you what,
that was disgusting in
terms of how it felt,

99
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:39,570
but when I see the color, I see
this kind of bright green color

100
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,740
that makes me feel less
disgusted actually

101
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:45,076
because it's sort of a fun
color and it reminds me

102
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:47,712
that it probably
isn't truly contaminated.

103
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,481
But this is the one that
I'm least likely to want to eat.

104
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:54,552
Even stronger than the visual
cues or the olfactory cues

105
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:58,589
it seemed that that touching
some substrate like this

106
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,425
gave us the strongest
aversive response.

107
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,159
Yeah.

108
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,060
So the first one you touched

109
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:05,630
-was this piece of foam here.
-Yeah.

110
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,766
-So yeah, it's basically dry.
-Solid.

111
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:12,737
Um, then I think you
went here, and that
is called konnyaku.

112
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:15,973
[Andrew]
Yeah, konnyaku is a kind of
starch-based gelatin

113
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:18,176
which is part of
the cuisine here.

114
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,579
You said it smelled fishy,
so in here you probably
have parts of seaweed.

115
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,648
Yeah, right, that's where
that's coming from.

116
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,517
It's soft, a bit wet,
but not very...

117
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:29,220
-It's not sticking to me.
-Not sticky, yeah.

118
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:33,458
And the last one here was
what maybe kids in the '90s

119
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,560
including myself
were playing with.

120
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,928
A slime toy.

121
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,730
Which is like
slimy and sticky.

122
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:42,700
And this,
it's just so gooey.

123
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,670
Well, and the fact that it's
pink makes it so much more fun

124
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,071
than if it was like, brown.

125
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,039
Mm-hmm.

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,107
Now, the research you're
doing with macaques,

127
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,776
is that something
I could observe?

128
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,212
We'd be willing to take you
out to the macaque habitat

129
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,048
and we could run some of these
similar experiments with them

130
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:02,687
-for you to observe.
-Ooh. I would love to. Yeah.

131
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,089
 Cecile's work with macaque
 monkeys on Koujima Island

132
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,026
 led her to develop
 an experiment that she
 and Andrew have been running

133
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:12,563
on the macaques here at
the Primate Research Institute.

134
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:15,233
 They want to know if
 macaques avoid feces

135
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:19,770
 because a feeling of disgust
 evolved in order to reduce

136
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:23,808
 the risk of their
 exposure to parasites.

137
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,511
-[Andrew] And here they are.
-[Michael] And here they are.

138
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:30,915
Oh look at that,
the babies are so cute.

139
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,783
-Here it's feeding time, almost.
-Mm-hm.

140
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,019
Which is a good time
for an experiment.

141
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,588
Yeah, we're a bit lucky,
they didn't eat that
much in the morning,

142
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,858
so hopefully they'll have that
extra motivation to participate.

143
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,261
And we're going to try
to play a bit with
the value of the food,

144
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,763
-so we'll start with their
regular monkey chow.
-Right.

145
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,966
Which they see a couple times
a day on a daily basis.

146
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:52,803
And then we'll see what
happens when we introduce
that nice, tasty peanut.

147
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,605
[Cecile speaking]

148
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:57,308
[Michael] Right. And so, I'm
assuming they like peanuts.

149
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:01,078
-Right, so--
-They don't like peanuts
in or on poop.

150
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:09,020
Well hopefully, we'll
find that out today.

151
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,187
[Michael] Okay,
so it looks like

152
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:13,024
Andrew is dumping the, um...

153
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,325
[Cecile]
Those are real feces

154
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:17,695
that he is going to pair
with the replica feces

155
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:22,767
that we have seen in the lab,
and a control brown wood chip.

156
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,669
-[Michael] Near each other?
-[Cecile] Yes, near each other.

157
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,004
Aha, all right.

158
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,906
-Let the games begin.
-Yeah.

159
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:33,744
 For the first trial, Andrew
 places monkey chow on
 the control block of wood,

160
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:37,315
 the replica feces
 and the real feces.

161
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:41,586
 Whether or not the macaques
 eat it may indicate their
 level of disgust.

162
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,256
[Michael] They're looking...
now here comes one.

163
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,857
-[Michael] No... oh, oh!
-[Cecile] Yeah.

164
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:48,225
[Cecile]
No, he's smelling the wood chip.

165
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:51,329
[Michael]
He smelled the wood chip,
the monkey chow fell off of it.

166
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,331
[Cecile] Yes.

167
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,334
[Michael]
Is he... gonna eat it?

168
00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:01,772
No. I think
regular old normal food
on poop is just--

169
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,675
it's a hard sell.

170
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:07,878
[Andrew over radio]

171
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,748
[Michael]
Shelled peanuts, okay.

172
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,351
-[Cecile] So that's
on the fake poop.
-[Michael] Yep.

173
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,653
-[Michael]
That's on the real poop.
-[Cecile] Yeah.

174
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:18,222
-[Michael]
And that's on the wood block.
-[Cecile] Yes.

175
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:23,327
 This time around, Andrew
 introduces peanuts, which
 the macaques really love.

176
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:26,664
Will this special treat
override their inner instincts?

177
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:31,402
Oh, oh, they're
already running in.

178
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,338
[both] Ooh.

179
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,240
[Michael] But he threw it.

180
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,377
-And he's washing it now.
-He's washing it.

181
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,945
All right, here
comes another one.

182
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,313
Oh, he went for the poop one!

183
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:44,248
-[Cecile] Yeah.
-[Michael laughs]

184
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,717
[Michael] The first one,
he just wants it to roll.

185
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:48,386
-He doesn't even want
to have to carry it.
-[Cecile] In the water.

186
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:52,089
This is rolling, so, they
do some of those behaviors.

187
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,824
And now he's washing
it in the water,

188
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,259
-[Cecile] Yeah.
-[Michael] Is it clean enough?

189
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,828
Oh, still gotta roll.

190
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:00,831
That was incredible,
because the peanuts that
were just on the wood chip,

191
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:03,267
those went straight
into monkey mouths.

192
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:05,269
 Was this an aberration?

193
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,438
 Andrew reloaded the peanut
 baits to find out.

194
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,240
-[Michael] Decoy.
-[Cecile] A female is
approaching.

195
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,108
[Michael] Yep, here she is.

196
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,678
She smells it first,
and then-- and then--

197
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,080
-[Cecile] Smells it again.
-[Michael] Believes it, eats it.

198
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:19,450
-[Cecile] On the fake.
-[Michael] That was
on the fake, yeah.

199
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,185
Very cool.

200
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:23,754
Now she already ate off
the decoy and it was safe.

201
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:27,892
She hasn't, oh she put
the control right in her mouth.

202
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,061
-[Cecile] Yes.
-[Michael] And she's going
to wash the real feces.

203
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,462
[Cecile] Yeah.

204
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,131
And she went for
the real feces last.

205
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:35,833
Yes, she did.

206
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,101
[Michael] She's got
a baby with her,

207
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:39,704
so I really hope
she cleans that.

208
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,739
[Cecile] Or maybe that's
the disadvantage,

209
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,276
she's carrying a baby,
she cannot afford, like,
cleaning everything.

210
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,445
Yeah.

211
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:53,050
I'm really
amused by how they
visually recognize feces.

212
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:55,486
-I mean we're far away,
it's hard for me to tell,
-Yes.

213
00:10:55,487 --> 00:11:00,324
but they can see that shape
or texture--

214
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,159
-"Be wary."
-Yeah.

215
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,929
 Over the course of several
 rounds of the experiment,

216
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,198
 the monkeys would eat off
 of the control,

217
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,935
 wash food from the replica,
 and be extremely hesitant

218
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,304
 towards anything
 that touched poop.

219
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,908
 The macaques demonstrated
 a clear and strong
 sense of disgust

220
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:23,414
that was driving their decision
making and potentially keeping
them safe from pathogens.

221
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:27,218
 With the experiment complete,
 Dr. McIntosh returned topside

222
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,487
 so we could discuss
 our findings.

223
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,056
So did you enjoy
the view from up here?

224
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:35,259
[Michael]
They did exactly what we
talked about earlier.

225
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,830
Ready to avoid, parasite
infested potential things.

226
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:43,901
Yeah, I mean it's
pretty clear, there's not
a complete hesitation

227
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,203
to pick up things
on actual feces

228
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:49,106
but the reactions that
the monkeys give when they do so

229
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:53,377
is just so clearly different
than when they are picking
things off the ground

230
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,379
or off the control items
that they have here.

231
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,785
Yeah, yeah, in fact,
I, you know, I only saw
a few trials here,

232
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:05,523
but as soon as the peanut
or the monkey chow on
the feces is picked up

233
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,459
and they realize that
the feces is coming with it

234
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,430
it's a sticky substance
and that was when their
revulsion got larger.

235
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:17,134
It almost seemed like they
might be absent-mindedly going
"I don't care,"

236
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:20,271
-and something deeper in them
was like, "you should care, you
should throw this,"
- Yeah.

237
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:26,076
roll it, wash it,
so it makes sense from
an evolutionary standpoint.

238
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:29,914
Well, Cecile, Andrew,
thank you again so much for
letting me come out here

239
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,583
to see a primate
experiment in action.

240
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,985
This was really phenomenal.
Thank you.

241
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,389
-[both] You're welcome.
-Thanks for coming.
