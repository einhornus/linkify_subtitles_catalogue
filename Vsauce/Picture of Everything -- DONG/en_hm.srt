00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,818
This website lets you create a custom
message that takes up the entire page.

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:08,839
You can then share the custom URL with
friends to say something loudly

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,209
bigly, but for more things you can do online

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,729
now, guys, this is DONG.
The Sound Walk

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,849
is like Guitar Hero meets a
side-scrolling platform

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,649
meets darkness. You have to press the
right keys to the beat of the music to

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,739
overcome obstacles.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,049
URL shorteners are useful, but I prefer URL

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,968
elongators, like this one. Enter a
short, easy to remember URL and

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,189
convert it into something

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,869
awesome like this.
TheHumanSuitcase recommended

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,429
Test Pilot, an excellent game where you
have to design your vehicle,

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,599
its propulsion and even its controls.
Now,

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,979
every time your puny little craft fails,
be sure to tab on over to the Sad

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,738
Trombone,

16
00:00:53,739 --> 00:01:01,119
where with 1-click you can feel like a loser.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,148
If you prefer
Christopher Walken's favorite noise,

18
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,748
use MoreCowbell.dj

19
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:08,789
to have cowbells 
automatically added to any MP3 you

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,499
upload. Now, I have yet to be totally
impressed by it, but I believe in what stands for.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,719
Dragonborn3 calmed me down
with Procatinator.com.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,059
Endless giant loops of cats

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,529
with fun music. And Superbanito sent me
a colour matching

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,519
game, where you have to find the right color
and eventually move onto tasks

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,279
like locating complementary colours.
In Gravity Duck you have to switch

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,809
gravity's direction to stay safe.

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,469
And doing poses like these allow album
artwork to extend in the real life,

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,849
you can check them out at SleeveFace.com.

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,909
Symon is an eery point-and-clicking, where you
explore your own dreams

30
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,209
and try to understand their
"doesn't quite make sense"

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,079
logic. And if you prefer everything,
Howard Hallis

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,339
has drawn it. Jensmalm showed me a
210 square foot picture of everything.

33
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,507
It took years to draw and contains
thousands of characters, celebrities,

34
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:09,069
memes.

35
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,458
It's got every single Pokemon and,
although Howard doesn't want to be

36
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,818
famous for this reason,

37
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,559
because he drew Waldo into it, it has become the

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,119
largest "Where's Waldo?" image ever made by a man.

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,869
Oh and here is something.
MoanMyIP

40
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,179
displays your device's Internet Protocol address

41
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:35,579
while girls sensually moan it.

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,159
Now, if you want weird stuff, Overthemoon206 sent me this playlist of

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,809
ilogically

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,208
awesome comedy and art. It's not scientific
or educational or anything, but it contains a

45
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,189
lot of cool channel 101 stuff

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,309
and more. And finally, Kevin showed me
OverAnalyzers yesterday, which I

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,399
promptly watched

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,199
all of. A bunch of brilliant researchers sent around
trying to figure out things like,

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,409
"where did the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
get the money they

50
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,619
used to buy pizza?" or
"how could Batman and Robin have gotten dressed

51
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,529
while sliding down a fireman's pole?"
Well, I've got a playlist of their episodes in the

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,729
description, where links to

53
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,729
everything can be found.

54
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,649
And as always,

55
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,529
thanks for watching.

56
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,649
One more thing. If you're tired of your
boring, simple

57
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,039
email address, why not go to this site?
For free,

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,019
you can set up a new email address with
what is most likely the longest

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,179
possible address?
For instance, I made

60
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,439
this one. Seriously.
