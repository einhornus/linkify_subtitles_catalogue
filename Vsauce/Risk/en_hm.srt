1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,259
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,249
When will you die? I don't mean you

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,999
specifically, I mean the mean of you all - the average

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,679
Vsauce viewer. By combining World
Health Organization life tables with YouTube

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,009
analytics for Vsauce viewers, we can calculate

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,709
that the average date everyone over the age of 15

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,949
watching this video right now will die on is

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:34,649
8:42 in the morning, November 28th, 2059.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,399
The mode is in 2073.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,869
Morbidly, but mathematically, about 340

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,779
of the people who watch this video this
week will not be around at this time

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,239
next year. These statistics are based on
averages but interestingly

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,619
the average person considers him or
herself anything

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,159
but average. Studies have consistently shown that the

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,268
average person believes he or she will
live a longer and healthier life

16
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,749
than the average person. We overestimate

17
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,689
the likelihood that bad things will
happen to other people and underestimate

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,979
the likelihood that they will happen to
us. It's a natural part of our psychology,

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,029
but, yeah, we miscalculate risk in many fascinating

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,999
ways. K.C. Cole points out that we are
often more responsive to threats that are personal

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,009
exotic, erratic and dramatic

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,619
than we are to threats that are well more likely.

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,649
I love one of her examples - imagine a
world where cigarettes

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,599
are harmless, but one cigarette pack

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,669
out of every eighteen thousand seven
hundred and fifty contains

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,959
a single cigarette laced with dynamite
that, when lit,

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,059
violently explodes, blowing the user's head off.

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,039
People would be loudly

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,009
and messily losing their heads every
day all over the world

30
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,089
but in that imaginary universe the same
number of people would die every day

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,359
because of smoking

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,449
that already do. The results

33
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,549
would just be more shocking, more
immediate and probably more likely to

34
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,799
affect our decisions.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,609
Last month, I and some of my favourite
YouTube creators met

36
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,749
with President Obama about the decisions

37
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,829
Americans make when it comes to
protecting themselves from the cost

38
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,219
of staying healthy. The issue with health
care is mired in conflict and debate

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,458
matched only by the turmoil of risk
assessment going on

40
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,039
in our own minds.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,299
Our myelinated machines use more biases and
shortcuts to evaluate probabilities

42
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,549
than can fit in a single video, but a
particularly strong example

43
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,609
is the availability heuristic. Our
tendency to think that something is more likely

44
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,379
because it happened recently or there
are more examples of it happening

45
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,009
available in our memories, not because it
actually is more likely.

46
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,109
We also over exaggerate risks we don't
have control over

47
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,429
while being comparatively fearless in
the face of equal

48
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,529
risks we nonetheless can control. Chianti
Stars famous 1969 study on risk

49
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,889
found that people were willing to accept risks
1,000 times greater

50
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,089
if they could control them, for instance,
driving a car than if they

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,719
didn't have control, for instance, a
nuclear disaster.

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,139
Let's talk about Abraham Wald.

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,129
Only so much extra armour can be added to
an airplane before it becomes too heavy to fly.

54
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,599
Now, during World War 2 the US military
noticed the planes returning

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,219
from enemy territory were usually damage
around the wings,

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,129
the body and the tail gunners.
So, they put more armour

57
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,549
on those areas. But it didn't make a
difference. The same number of planes

58
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,619
continued to be lost. So the military hired Wald

59
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,549
for his mathematical super powers.
He told them to put what little

60
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,789
armour they could on the parts of the planes that

61
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,279
weren't being hit. Why?

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,859
Well, because returning planes were survivors.

63
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,699
They took damage in areas where a plane
can take damage

64
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,079
and survive. Damage to other areas
caused the plane to

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,028
not return.
Wald was protecting them against

66
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,759
survivorship bias - only paying attention

67
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,239
to successes. A similar phenomenon is
partly responsible for why music

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,299
feels like it was just better back in
the day than it is now.

69
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,228
Is that really true or are we just remembering

70
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:39,679
the good stuff? Wald's work saved
thousands of lives and made flying safer

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,859
for many more. Tragically, a few years
later Wald and his wife

72
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,559
died in an airplane crash. You can't

73
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,659
predict how and when you will die, it's not that easy.

74
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,279
But a few risk scoring systems have been created

75
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,319
to make the discussion and comparison of
hazardous behaviors

76
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,539
clearer. The micromort was conceived by

77
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,209
Ronald A. Howard and is an amount of risk
equal to a one in 1,000,000 probability

78
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,399
of dying. John Green discussed Micromorts

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,679
in a fantastic mental floss video you
should watch, if you haven't already.

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,899
He points out that a single skydive
temporarily increases your

81
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,569
death risk by seven micromorts - a seven

82
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,889
in 1,000,000 chance of dying. That's the same

83
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,869
as smoking 5 cigarettes. It's been
estimated that you gain one micromort

84
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,639
for every half litre of wine you drink.

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,839
Every year you spend drinking Miami tap water, every 1,000 miles you fly in a jet plane,

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,939
every 230 miles you travel by car, every
20 miles you travel by bicycle

87
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,109
and every 6 miles you travel by motorcycle

88
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,679
or canoe. There is a happier

89
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,418
unit of risk - the microlife. Proposed by
David Spiegelhalter and Alejandro Leiva,

90
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,649
a microlife is gained by doing helpful

91
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,158
things. In small quantities their benefits are roughly

92
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,228
linear and one microlife is the equivalent of

93
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,769
30 extra minutes of life.
Twenty minutes of moderate exercise

94
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,299
gives you two more microlives.

95
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,008
Two hours of sedentary behavior

96
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:25,439
-1 microlives. Plenty of

97
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,638
non-scientific websites exist that allow
you to calculate when you will die

98
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,658
based on your life expectancy and habits.

99
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,348
PokeMyBirthday.com is the kind of goofy site

100
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,418
that takes a nonetheless interesting look
at not your death,

101
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,519
but your birth. Enter your birthday and
see when you were conceived,

102
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,439
when your mother probably first realized
she was pregnant with you

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,628
and the dates your parents created or
moved into position the two cells

104
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,728
that eventually became the thirty trillion cells

105
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,348
that are now watching this video. Every single person

106
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,859
who ever died, died right here on planet Earth.

107
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,888
Except for three.

108
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,918
The crew of Soyuz 11.

109
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,068
On June 30th, 1979, their cabin depressurized,

110
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,579
while returning to Earth, before they
crossed the agreed-upon boundary between

111
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,908
Earth and outer space. Far from

112
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,739
any populated area, a three-sided metallic columns

113
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,519
sits where they're craft landed in Kazakhstan.

114
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,698
It's a remote memorial to humankind's

115
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,429
remotest deaths. We haven't

116
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,329
all died here on Earth, but so far we have all been born

117
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,379
here. Thanks for being here.

118
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,299
Stay safe, and as always,

119
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
 thanks for watching.
