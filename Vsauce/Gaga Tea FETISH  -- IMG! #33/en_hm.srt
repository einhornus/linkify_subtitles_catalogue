00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,088
This cat better watch out. And the only
thing more badass than guns

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:11,219
is kittens.
It's episode 33 of IMG!

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,389
This is every way

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,059
Mario can die on one page.
And this is a Hadouken manicure.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,859
Could you grab me some peanut butter?
Oh, but watch out for the honey.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,509
Shaving cream.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,999
But the best type of spill? Cat face.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,909
Look how happy it made this guy.
What? Ohhhh.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,499
Banana dog. Better than a heart butt.
And spot the difference.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,439
Here's Lady Gaga drinking tea. Some guys
really, really like this and thus

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:51,269
hotgirlsdrinkingtea.tumblr.com.
Enjoy.

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,179
Remember the Big Bad Wolf?
Well, here's what he should

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,429
have done. Do you guys accept Batman & Joker
money? Well, look how well I throw a hammer.

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,529
Oh.
The great outdoors

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,008
with a body.
And the great outdoors with a face.

16
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:11,029
But let's get trippier with GIFs.
Some are hypnotizingly

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,809
patriotic and others use rapidly reversing
colors to perpetually move

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,799
towards you.
This one too.

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,519
If you've got red-cyan 3D glasses, take look at these

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,749
worms.
Just do it. Some just

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,059
did it. But now let's lay down with stuffed
animal versions of ourselves and enjoy

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,519
two montages

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:44,969
in one video.

24
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,379
Photobombs are great but this one is
currently my favorite. "Hi!"

25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,658
Let's hold hands, I want to keep you safe.

26
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,728
Uh, just kidding.
Going for the dunk?

27
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:58,879
Wait, wait, wait. You got a booger there.
And you know what? Lots of guys get caught staring.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,919
John Kerry, even Obama.
Sometimes it's sneaky,

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,978
sometimes it's surprising and sometimes
it's just judgmental.

30
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,018
On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming Anton
showed me that Sponge Bob

31
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,799
is made out of sadness.
Stephanie introduced a keyboard shaped

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,458
waffle maker and Krishna showed as a dog
that can make things float

33
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,659
and terrify people.
Now it's time to watch

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,859
LÃœT on our other channel, Vsauce2.
Vsauce2 is just like Vsauce,

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,389

specific over there.
