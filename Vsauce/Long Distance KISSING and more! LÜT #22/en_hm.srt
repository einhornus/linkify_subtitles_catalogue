1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,398
Starry night socks and a gun that shoots

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:10,289
ketchup onto your food.
It's episode 22 of LÜT.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,619
First, let's break the ice... or let the ice

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,358
do the breaking itself as a hammer.
Of course, this hammer lets you open bottles.

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,549
When you pour out the contents, be sure
it's into a pint glass wearing a Batman

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,829
cape.
Pour some water into this fish tank, it's

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,268
cute and small and completely powered by your USB

8
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:33,429
port.
Hey look, pants. Scratch and sniff pants.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,909
The fabric literally has raspberry
perfume scent capsules baked

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,389
into it, which break when scratched
releasing the smell.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,549
Now if you hate pants, don't wear any.
Don't even wear a skin for that matter.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,659
These leggings look like your muscles.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,369
If you're going to be apart from you
love on Valentine's Day, send them a kiss

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,959
with Kissenger.
Two robots connected wirelessly,

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,218
so that when you kiss one,
the other robot relays that

16
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,259
kiss so the other person feels it,
wherever they are.

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,618
ThisIsWhyImBroke.com features
amazing things. For instance,

18
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,699
brake light decal masks to make your
brake lights look like this.

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,279
On Amazon, I also found a Superman,
tropical fish

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,919
hibiscus flowers, skulls, or this

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,359
really literal one.
They also have "Word as

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,969
Image," a fun book that uses the letters
and words to suggest what the word means.

23
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,159
For instance: vampire, smile,

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,649
clock.
You can see more words like that

25
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,059
and see them animated by following a link to
video in this video's description where

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,158
links to everything

27
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,179
can be found.
When your dog fetches

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,599
this ball, it'll look like he's got a big
old flappy tongue. They're

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,699
currently out of stock, but this one
isn't, which when held in a dog's mouth,

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,029
gives it a moustache. If you're looking
for great gift ideas, try doing the

31
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,279
opposite. The worst gift ever.
This fun little package literally contains

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,859
nothing

33
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,309
but socks and underwear.
More exciting is disney couture.

34
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,819
An oversized castle ring or a double-ring

35
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,589
that puts all the dwarves on your hand.
If you like your accessories more practical,

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,729
try out some working thermometer earrings,

37
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,488
a compass necklace or some Phillips head screw

38
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,909
earrings.
Ouchie Wow Wow! Piranha Plant earrings are

39
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,859
always a good idea, but you can keep it
8-bit with Mr Dandy's

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,389
pendants asteroids.
Or this one, he calls not Pac-man,

41
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,749
but Pukeman. Have a ball while snuggling
with your soft plush

42
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,689
testicle or ovary or bladder

43
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,029
or brain or intestines or anatomical

44
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,049
heart. For more heart shaped items, let's
talk heart-shaped

45
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,929
umbrellas, paper clips,
a warm heart-shaped hot water bottle

46
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,949
or these measuring cups on FredFlare
who also carry a neat bed of

47
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,479
tulips USB hub,

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,679
a frog you add water to to get yourself
a prince, a map of the world

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,219
to scratch off where you've been,
a log to rest your head on -

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,049
don't worry it's a pillow - and the only
thing your hamburger phone

51
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,899
really needs...
French fries flavored lip balm

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,419
Oh, NeatoShop also has hearts stuff, like
an anatomical heart

53
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,469
pencil holder.
They'll also provide balloon animal

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,568
book ends. A zombie cupid figurine,

55
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,929
a devilish skin for your iPad or a snap
suit for your baby that says

56
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,309
"ipood." Before it was poo, it was cake
served on a high heel shoe,

57
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,548
but if you want something darker,
check out Despair Inc's

58
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,768
BitterSweets - candy hearts that say things like

59
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,738
"So so alone," "Aging poorly"

60
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,738
or "Dog is cuter."
This special fabric dye

61
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,298
is sensitive to light,
so you can mix it up, paint it on a shirt

62
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,109
and then leave it in the Sun to develop
actual photographs from negatives.

63
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,969
Oh, and that fashion hanky in your shirt pocket?
It can be

64
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,369
a notepad. 
Sushibooties let you wear sashimi

65
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,348
as slippers.
They also carry fortune cookie baby booties,

66
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,729
a nunchuck pillow and for the baby
a nunchuck rattle.

67
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,988
This is Naomi Kyle's autograph.
You can't

68
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,279
have this one, but for more awesome
things you can buy online,

69
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,797
check out her show on IGN's new channel, Start.

70
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,857
The whole channel's great and she goes
in-depth into awesome things you can

71
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:22,439
actually

72
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,319
own. And unlike LÜT, they actually give
away some of the stuff they cover

73
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,519
to lucky viewers.
So go check that out...

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,439
And as always,

75
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,320
thanks for watching.
