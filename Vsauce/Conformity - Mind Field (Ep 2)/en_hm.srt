00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,038
to see something that's unfunny

187
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,843
as hilarious.

188
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,412
We've invited these people

189
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,480
to participate in
a psychological experiment.

190
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,815
But here's the thing:

191
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,250
everyone in this room

192
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,551
is an actor,

193
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,119
except this guy.

194
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,588
He thinks he's just killing time
in this waiting room

195
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,157
before the experiment begins.

196
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,959
But this is the experiment,

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,728
and that's no joke.

198
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,530
Hey, how's everyone doing today?

199
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,631
[INDISTINCT MURMURING]

200
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,699
My name's Michael.

201
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Nice to meet you all.

202
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,268
Thanks for participating.

203
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,804
It's important that everyone
be kind of in a chatty mood.

204
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,205
So here's a question:

205
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,140
anyone got some good jokes?

206
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,142
- I have a great one.
- Oh, yeah?

207
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,946
Why did the hipster burn
his mouth on coffee?

208
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,549
Because he drank it
way before it was cool.

209
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,784
[LAUGHTER]

210
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,920
- Get it, yeah?
- I get it, yeah.

211
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,289
Our subject thinks
the real joke is funny,

212
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,191
but keep in mind,

213
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,827
the joke I'm going to tell
is complete nonsense.

214
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,129
It's not funny.
It's just words.

215
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,632
Everyone but the subject has
been instructed to laugh at it.

216
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,702
The question is,
will the pressure to conform

217
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,170
make the subject laugh?

218
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,238
Okay, how about this one?

219
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,173
Uh, a giraffe is at the airport

220
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,042
going through the TSA line.

221
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,710
And the security agent says,

222
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,644
"Hey, is this your laptop?"

223
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,279
And the giraffe says,

224
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,949
"I thought you'd never ask."

225
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,218
[LAUGHTER]

226
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,351
Oh, my God.

227
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,120
You guys have never
heard that before?

228
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,288
- No, never.
- No.

229
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,591
- It's pretty famous.
- I didn't.

230
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,826
This is a classic example
of conformity.

231
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,963
Even when the crowd acts
in a way that makes no sense,

232
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,232
the need to fit in
can still be very strong.

233
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,667
Okay, how about this one?

234
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,969
Uh, two penguins are
driving in a car.

235
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,938
The driver says, "Hey, could you
change the radio station?"

236
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,108
And the other one says,
"No radio. Four wheels."

237
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,878
[LAUGHTER]

238
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,846
That was better.

239
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,783
Laughter can be a powerful
tool for social conformity,

240
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,584
which is exactly why sitcoms

241
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,086
use canned laughter.

242
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,921
How do you feel about

243
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,823

was a pretty girl

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,827
I'd jump clean over it.
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,429
The laugh track
entices you at home

247
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,830
to laugh along,

248
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,999
even when a joke
might not be that funny.

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,135
So will our other subjects
feel compelled to laugh

250
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,737
at our meaningless joke?

251
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,039
So a giraffe is at the airport.

252
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,674
And it's in the security line,

253
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,876
and the TSA agent says,

254
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,011
"Is this your laptop?"

255
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,346
And the giraffe says,

256
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,014
"I thought you'd never ask."

257
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,283
[LAUGHTER]

258
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,051
"Hey, is this your laptop?"

259
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,286
And the giraffe says,

260
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,821
"I thought you would never ask."

261
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,890
- [LAUGHTER]
- What?

262
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,793
Since our subjects are
in a conforming mood

263
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,195
let's take this
a step further.

264
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,696

265
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,164

- Sure.
- Let's see how committed

267
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,700
they are to fitting in.

268
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,370
Will they repeat
the nonsensical joke

269
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,372
to another one of our actors?

270
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,408
We were telling jokes earlier.

271
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,143
Should I say the, uh...

272
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,344
- Yes.
- The giraffe? Okay.

273
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,879

to come with me

275
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,482

00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,117
Okay. Good.

277
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,551

Yeah. Dude, you tell it.

- Well...

No, you got it.
You got it. Say it.

281
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,257

is in a line...

- Okay.
- Waiting.

284
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,863
And the...
and the agent asks him,

285
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,765
"Is that your laptop?"

286
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:40,372

really think

00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,944
my meaningless joke is funny?

304
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,146
It's time to let them in
on what's really going on.

305
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,516
Everyone here today

- Okay.
- We have all been instructed

to laugh at that
dumb giraffe joke,

308
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,888
which is not even a joke.

309
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,257
It's just a meaningless thing.

310
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,294
And then we see if the one
person who isn't in on it,

311
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,895
which in this round was you...

312
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,397
how they respond.

313
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,032
Why did you never say,

314
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,367
"What?"

315
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,902
I think it was people
laughing around me,

316
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,105
and I was trying to understand
why that was funny.

317
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,173
And then I had to make sense
of it in my mind,

318
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,876
and then I think I made it
funny to myself.

319

That process
of mental gymnastics

320
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,247
is known as
cognitive dissonance.

321

When you've done something
you don't truly believe in,

322
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,452
like laughing just because
everyone else did,

323
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,955
you'll often try to come
to terms with your behaviour

324
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,124
through denial
and justification.

325
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,459
It's not a joke; I just made
that up, and it's nonsense.

I thought it was funny.

made no sense?

00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,146
It's definitely a...
a conformity thing.

[LAUGHTER]

338
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:36,388
One of the most disappointing
and terrifying aspects

339
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,991
of our desire not to stand out

340
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,993
is the bystander effect.

341
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,163
People are less likely
to help victims

342
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,932
if other people are around.

343
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,034
One of the most famous examples

344
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,304
is told in Psych 101 classes
all over the world.

345
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,540
It's the story
of Kitty Genovese,

346
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,542
a woman who was brutally stabbed

347
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,477
and raped in New York City

348
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,579
in 1964.

349
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,281
It was a murder
that symbolised

350
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,217
the apathy of many
to big-city crime.

351
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,253
On a March night
back in 1964,

352
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,023
28-year-old bar manager
Kitty Genovese

353
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,925
was stabbed to death
on a street

354
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,526
in Kew Gardens, Queens.

355
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,395
Police say at least 38 people

356
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,529
heard her screams

357
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,264
but did nothing to help.

358
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,568
The hypothesis was that
each and every one of them

359
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,004
assumed someone else
would call the police,

360
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,073
so they didn't have to bother
to do so themselves.

361
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,942
It wasn't their responsibility,

362
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,012

00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,355
I just feel, like, sensation,

542
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,090
like, near my eye and nose area.

543
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,226
I feel like it's definitely
getting brighter, though.

544
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,828
Okay, could you say more
about the increased brightness?

545
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,498
It's not comfortable to look
at the lights, really.

546
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,466
What we're seeing
from these subjects

547
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,835
could be a form of
informational conformity,

548
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,103
or even what's called

549
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,405
a contact high,

550
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,673
a psychological phenomenon

551
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,974
that occurs when a sober person

552
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,842
comes into contact with someone

553
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,678
who is under the influence
of drugs

554
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,581
and begins to manifest
the same physical symptoms.

555
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,016
I can now debrief you

556
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,018
on what has been going on.

557
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,654
So none of you took anything

558
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,122
but, uh, water today.

559
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,791
What?

560
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,393
[LAUGHTER]

561
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,629
And we're just kind of looking
at the way

562
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,564
that groups conform together.

563
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,633
We wanted to see
what it would take

564
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,002
to get someone to fall in line
with the group.

565
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,837
Did you feel actual changes,

566
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,372
or were you saying some things

567
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,807
just to fit in
and not stick out?

568
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,508
No, I felt relaxed,
so I don't get...

569
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,143
I can't figure it...
I still feel relaxed.

570
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,611
Are you surprised
to have heard

571
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,814
that you just drank water?

572
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:22,981
Yeah.

573
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,651
I definitely feel different.

574
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,753
I actually did hear,
yeah, an echo.

575
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,689
The desire to conform
is so strong,

576
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,558
the subjects continue
to believe

577
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,460
in their manifested symptoms,

578
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,695
even after learning
the drug was fake.

579
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,630
I am prone to
anxiety attacks, though,

580
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,165
so I felt relaxed.

581
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,401
Well, you should take
more of this nothing.

582
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:47,139
[LAUGHTER]

583
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,509
Human society is
incredibly complex.

584
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,879
And the duelling forces
pushing us to conform

585
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,815
and also to express
our individuality

586
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,617
are both necessary.

587
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:01,854
Other people can influence us
in good ways

588
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,056
and in not-so-good ways.

589
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,524
But at the end of the day,

590
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,092
just remember this:

591
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:11,597
what did the walrus
say to the doctor?

592
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,799
Give up?

593
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,134
Cardboard.

594
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:17,436
[LAUGHTER]

595
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,438
Go ahead, laugh.

596
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,140
Everyone's doing it.

597
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:24,043
You don't want to look like
you don't get it, do you?

598
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:25,678
Good, that's what I thought.

599
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,979
Thanks for laughing,

600
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,547
and as always,

601
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:35,788
thanks for watching.
