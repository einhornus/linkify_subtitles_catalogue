Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And thank you for
clicking on this video. But how many times

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:13,659
a day do you click? And how many times a day
do you type keys on a keyboard? You might

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,929
be surprised by the answer. And one of the
best ways to know exactly how many actions

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,188
you're taking per day is to use software like WhatPulse.

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,729
WhatPulse measures how often you do things.
Keystrokes, mouse clicks. It even measures

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,929
the total distance you've moved your
cursor. It's really fun stuff to track and,

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,299
of course, depending on who you are, or what
day it is, or what you do, your totals per

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,759
day will change. But it's been found that,
on average, people who use computers a lot,

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:52,659
like office workers, type around 5,000 to 10,000
keystrokes every day. And they click a mouse

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:01:02,139
about 1,500 to 3,000 times a day. Interestingly,
computer users in the UK typed the most.

11
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:09,319
Sitting down and using a computer - typing,
scrolling, moving the mouse - burns about 20

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,829
more calories an hour than just doing nothing.
I mean, if you do nothing, you're still

13
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,779
using calories. It takes energy for you to
exist. You have to keep your body temperature

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,269
where it should be, you have to breath, pump
blood. To figure out how many calories it

15
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:32,118
takes, per day, for you to just exist, simply
take your weight in pounds and multiply

16
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,809
it by 11. If you want to be more specific,
take your weight in kilograms and multiply

17
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:48,359
it by .02. What you wind up with is the number
of calories it takes, per minute, to keep

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,439
you existing. That's the number of calories
that you burn every minute doing nothing.

19
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,609
It's not very much. And using a computer doesn't
raise it that much higher, but don't be discouraged,

20
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,479
because typing and texting can bind us together.

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:16,279
We text and type on keyboards a lot. And rapidly.
In fact, every day, 6 billion text messages

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:25,639
are sent.
And there are only 7 billion people on Earth.

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,299
And that's just texting. We'll add keyboard
typing in a little bit later. But I want

24
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,439
to take a quick detour and talk about the
letters, and the characters, and the keys themselves.

25
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,339
They're not all pressed the same number of
times. Some are more common than others. Let's

26
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,749
begin visually. This is a sculpture of a keyboard, where every letter has been raised to a height

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,669
that corresponds to its popularity compared
to the other letters. The letter "E" is the

28
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,018
most common letter typed in almost 
every language that has a letter "E."

29
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:02,408
But to figure out letter frequencies in texts
that you type yourself, use Patrick Wied's

30
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:07,888
heat map. On this site you can type a sentence
in and see how frequently the characters are

31
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,168
used. For instance, this sentence contains
every letter in the alphabet at least once,

32
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,368
but it uses "E" and "O" the most.

33
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:21,818
Roughly speaking, and considering different
languages, of all the characters typed, or

34
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:29,299
tapped on a phone everyday, about 9% of them
are the letter "E," which is a lot, but the

35
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:36,359
letter "E" is not the most common key. The
space bar is the most commonly pressed key -

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,679
nearly twice as popular as the letter "E."

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,318
Now that we know about the space bar's popularity,
let's return to texting and add in keyboard

38
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,809
typing. If we assume that about 350 million
people are typing 5-10,000 characters a day

39
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,419
on keyboards, and add that to the number of
characters being texted everyday, we can do

40
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,679
a little bit of math and determine that at
any given second, here, on Earth, the space

41
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,959
bar is being pressed 6 million times.

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,539
6 million spaces bar a second! What a great
world, right? Well, let's think of it this

43
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:24,159
way. Because it only takes 1/10th of a second
to tap, or type, a space bar, when you push

44
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,519
the space bar, statistically speaking, as
many as 600,000 other people on Earth did

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,479
that at the exact same time that you did.

46
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,619
So, if you ever feel alone, just give yourself
some space and know that more than half a

47
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,959
million people are doing that exact same thing.

48
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,119
And as always,

49
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,180
thanks for watching.
