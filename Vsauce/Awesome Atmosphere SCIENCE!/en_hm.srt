Vsauce, are you leaning back right now?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,057
Of course you're not. But you will be soon,
because a new episode of Vsauce Leanback

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:11,499
has just been released and to start it,
click the link at the top of

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,789
this video's description. This week's topic is
really fun. It's a menagerie of awesome

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,919
videos from producers

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,999
all over YouTube with the atmosphere

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,389
of Earth as our rough guide.
We're going to begin way down here,

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,909
in this part of the atmosphere, the troposphere,
which is where most weather occurs

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,018
and where we live.

10
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,968
And then we'll move up into the
stratosphere and beyond to the

11
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,808
mysterious mesosphere

12
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:39,828
and then the gigantic thermosphere where
space shuttles roam.

13
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:44,579
And even though they said it couldn't be done,
we will be discussing the exosphere

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,269
today.
So what are you waiting for? Click the link

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,729
at the top of this video's description to
begin autoplay mode and let

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,109
each video segment start one after the
other. So all you have to do is lean back

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,698
and let the information hit you in the face.
I'll see you soon

18
00:00:58,699 --> 00:00:59,898
in the lean back.

19
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,778
And as always,

20
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:02,279
thanks for watching.
