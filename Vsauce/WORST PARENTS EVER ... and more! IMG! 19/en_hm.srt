00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,768
Some various junk that, from the front, looks
like this. And, the world's first orange aligator.

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:10,829
It's episode 19 of IMG!

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,328
A new Kinect trick allows you to take photos
with your Xbox, and then build them in Minecraft.

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,419
And here's some true Tetris love.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,188
When your car gets covered in snow, let the
snow people drive it. And then, with a little

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,688
creativity, prove that money is the root of
all evil...Zombies...

7
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:30,409
And why spray paint all willy-nilly when you
can paint each individual brick and make a

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,209
pixelated Link?

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,929
If Greedo was on the "Jersey Shore" it would
suck, but this really blows...

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,949
Awesome...oh...

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,968
This is how pumpkin pie is made...maybe you'd
prefer some Star Wars cakes, or TV dinner

12
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:47,648
cupcakes?

13
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:53,499
But, before you wash it all down, this is
why drinking is like yoga.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,049
This issue of Parent's Magazine is old and
photoshopped, but covering letters always

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,479
makes places more fun, especially if it's
accidental.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,059
Ted Williams had an awesome week, and to celebrate,
here are some equally awesome homeless signs...enjoy.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:20,619
Now, it's time for the worst parenting ever.
We've got grocery shopping, party time, snakes,

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,989
pole dancing lessons, champagne, and, "hey
you look angry, take this."

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,389
Right now it's Jesus, but, upside down, it's
Satan.

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,099
And where's the human covered in paint? Oh, there
he is. There he is. Where is he here?

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,359
Well, this is true.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,399
Ok, let's look at some hilariously inappropriate
t-shirts:

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,279
Wrong strategy. Wrong age. Wrong...everything...And,
thanks for the warning...

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,059
Here's a great vanity plate. And, she is pretty...WOAH,
SQUISHY BALL!

25
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,319
On Facebook, you guys are still at it. Ryan
Tim brought us "Hard Rock," and he also brought

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,889
us a most nutritious breakfast.
