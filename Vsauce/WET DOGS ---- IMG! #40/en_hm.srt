1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,139
Blockhead bunnies and disembodied cat
unicorn princesses.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,219
It's episode 40 of IMG!

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,619
You've gotta be careful around ducks.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,798
Seriously. But it's okay to be smug

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,249
with a panda.
If you've got extra time carve Lincoln

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,719
out of Oreo filling.
Or check out more of Sam

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,588
Spratt's work. He recently made some 
awesome mean faces.

8
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:29,819
Forever alone is good too. It's also good
as a costume. If you can't afford

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,399
costumes, here's how to be a table.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,019
It really, I mean, it's safer than trying
to sit with a dog around.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,558
But let's move on to a famous photo.
This Windows desktop image

12
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,709
has a title. It's called "Bliss" and was
taken in 1996 by a man named

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,698
Charles O'Rear in Sonoma County, California.
Now, since the photo was taken

14
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,229
a vineyard has moved in and today
the hill looks like

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,878
this. Let's get mappy. This map shows what
people call soft drinks.

16
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,399
Blue is where they say 'pop,'
yellow is where they say 'soda'

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,829
and red is where they tend to call all soft drinks

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,059
'coke.' Now this map bloats up and squeezes
countries based on the size

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,359
of their annual GDP, the total market
value of all goods and services the

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,919
country produces in a year.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,299
Notice how small the African continent
is, even though it's actually

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,369
quite large.
Seriously, you could fit

23
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,229
United States inside Africa along with
Europe, India,

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,499
China, Japan and more.
By the way,

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,759
the diameter of the Moon is
approximately the length

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,409
of the United States of America,
which means that roughly, to scale,

27
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,589
this is the size of the Moon.
And finally,

28
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,739
this map shows the remoteness of areas of the world.

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,729
The darker the region,
the further away it is from a large city.

30
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,729
But if you really wanna get away, 
climb to the top of Chimborazo in

31
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,349
Ecuador.

32
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,759
It's not the tallest mountain in the
world, but because the Earth

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,749
bulges slightly in the middle and it's
a big mountain near the equator,

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,969
its peak is actually the furthest point on

35
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,749
Earth from the center of the Earth.
Now, a bunch of dogs

36
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:24,229
shaking off water.
Enjoy.

37
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,869
Okay, here's a trick. If you wanna know
where an image came from or find other

38
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,329
versions or sizes,

39
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,369
go to Google Image Search and drag the picture

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,519
right into your browser.
Boom. Success.

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,959
And if you wanna lose your mind,
there are plenty of GIFs to do it,

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,189
but I'll recommend ScillyMission's Swirl page.

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,609
Move your cursor around and feel powerful or

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,099
nauseous.
Of course, the best cure for nausea is

45
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,779
eating a baby. Right, grandma? Oh boy.
Instead, let's just wear slippers

46
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,389
shaped like babies. And here's something
huge. In our explosion video I mentioned

47
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,639
the US's Pacific atomic tests

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,449
and then yesterday I came across this
incredible real photo of the beach

49
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,989
and in the distance an atomic underwater detonation.

50
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,829
It's pretty terrifying.
Just a few hours ago

51
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,849
Vsauce surpassed 300,000 subscribers,

52
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,869
which is awesome.
You guys rule and

53
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,219
the Vsauce team will continue to bring
you exactly what you want,

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,779
because...

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,799
As always,

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,220
thanks for watching.
