1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,539
An R2-D2 pepper mill and cologne that makes you smell

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,999
like Play-doh.
It's episode 20 of LÃœT.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,718
This wallet

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,468
looks like a lot of hundreds and these
bars of soap from ThinkGeek

5
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:18,439
contain caffeine, really. Each shower you
take delivers the same

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,319
as a cuppa coffee, because caffeine can
be absorbed through your skin.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,399
Soup up your phone's camera with
wide-angle telephoto and fish eye lenses

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,409
all in one contraption and then charge
your phone via USB

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,769
by installing sockets with USB ports.
Protect it with a heat-sensitive

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,859
backing that responds to your touch, like that little touch you add to your outfit by wearing

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,569
a tie that says joystick,

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,509
pong, Guitar Hero, Tetris or Duck hunt.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,359
Your kids can stamp animal footprints
with these sandals. And this stamp

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,409
allows you to print over 2,000
different Japanese emoticons.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,609
Also on Japan Trend Shop, a home planetarium

16
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,198
that project ten thousand of the stars and
galaxies seen in the northern hemisphere

17
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,198
onto your wall. These holiday cards for web
developers are stamped with the recipe

18
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,029
for eggnog

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,259
in Python, JavaScript, Relieve and PHP.
Pour some beer out of a skull pitcher

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,489
and make important life decisions with
this magic 8 ball

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,798
pen.
Then relax on your space invader couch or

22
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,188
sit on the toilet next to your dragon
toilet paper tyrant

23
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,649
and rest your head on the pillow that
makes you look like you're on the cover

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,129
of a magazine.
Do you like jewelry and engineering?

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,459
Well, grab yourself a gear-ring and how about this LED

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,669
faucet that tells the temperature of water
without getting you wet.

27
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,129
Blue is cold, green is warm and red is hot.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,019
Hot like this heart necklace.
It's anatomically correct.

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,368
Cool down some ice cream scooped into
stackable cylinders

30
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,919
and decorate your body things to Etsy
user project Pinup,

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,118
who makes diablo health and mana
potion earrings,

32
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,658
but that's not all. She also makes
amazingly creepy cameos.

33
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,228
Remember the brain I used in the deja
vu episode? I bought it

34
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,798
from Evolution, a store in Manhattan that also
has an online store,

35
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,309
where you can buy actual dinosaur teeth,
actual pieces of meteorites

36
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,388
and more.
Today's free thing is more of a DONG -

37
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,479
Gapminder - a really cool site that allows
you to chart global data,

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,969
like life expectancy versus income
per person by country

39
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,369
and even play it through time to see how
things have changed.

40
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,139
More videos coming soon,
especially about outer space.

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,488
Why? Because I'm here at Space Camp with
Brad and Liam

42
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,839
from World of the Orange. We're shooting stuff
for YouTube.com/SpaceLab. The

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,789
only cool thing I've seen so far is this

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,299
pin they gave me right there.
Just

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,879
kidding. It's gonna be awesome.

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,679
And as always,

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,820
thanks for watching.
