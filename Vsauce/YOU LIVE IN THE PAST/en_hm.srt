00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,298
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and today
we are going to be talking about the past.

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:10,558
But not like history—in fact—we will
be talking about what we call now.

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,848
This very newest moment in time,
and the fact that we can

4
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:18,508
never really be aware of or live
in what we call now,

5
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:21,318
because it takes time for our brain

6
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:24,568
to process the information about
what's happening now,

7
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:28,398
and it takes time for that information
to get from the rest of our body

8
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,078
to our brain.

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,498
In fact, the taller you are,

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:37,118
the further back from now, the further
back from the past you live.

11
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,628
But more importantly, why do we call

12
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,918
emotional, relationship-based movies

13
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:44,498
targeted at females
chick flicks?

14
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:46,178
Well, for the answers to these questions,

15
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,178
we're going to start with the
flash lag effect.

16
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:53,348
David Eagleman has done some amazing
research on this effect.

17
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:58,608
It's what occurs when a participant looks
at a ring moving around in a circle.

18
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:02,028
A light is flashing exactly in the middle
of the ring.

19
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:07,188
This is exactly what the photons landing
on their retinas represent.

20
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,988
But when asked what they saw, participants
responded they saw this.

21
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,958
Now, for the longest time, it was
hypothesized that people said this

22
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,128
because our brains guess ahead.

23
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:22,038
Our brain assumed that the ring
would continue doing what it had been doing,

24
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,838
and figured it would be safer to go ahead
and say that the ring was already

25
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,548
a bit ahead of the light.

26
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,088
But Eagleman wanted to know what
would happen if

27
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,388
when that flash of light occurred in
the middle of the ring,

28
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:34,388
the ring all of a sudden reversed direction

29
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:36,728
and spun around the other way.

30
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,148
If our brains really are guessing ahead,

31
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:41,858
participants should still say

32
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,938
that they saw this,

33
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,028
because the brain figured that the ring
would be there and were surprised

34
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:48,478
when it went the other direction.

35
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,828
But instead, participants
said that they saw this.

36
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,738
Now, how could they have seen this
if they had no way of knowing

37
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,538
that the ring was going to reverse direction?
Were their brains clairvoyant?

38
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,488
Can our brains see into the future?

39
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:04,168
As it turns out, no.

40
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:08,918
What's really happening here is that
our eyeballs are receiving an image—

41
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,928
an image of a flash of light
inside a ring.

42
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:15,268
But then our brains wait a little bit

43
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,728
to make sure that we have the full story.

44
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,518
And as the ring begins to reverse direction,

45
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,608
that new information is incorporated
into what we actually sense,

46
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:29,448
and we become aware of the wrong
version of now.

47
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,648
By doing more studies with
rings traveling at different speeds,

48
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,408
Eagleman was able to determine

49
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,448
that what we are aware of as now,

50
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,288
what our brain tells us is happening

51
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:44,708
actually happened 80 milliseconds
in the past!

52
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,048
Now, 80 milliseconds is not a lot of time,

53
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:52,048
but it's a little scary to think that
our brain has no

54
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,218
physical way of knowing, being aware of,
or even living anywhere

55
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,388
but slightly in the past.

56
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,148
Nerve impulses travel through our body

57
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:08,188
at a top speed of around 250 miles per hour.

58
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,946
But now, look at Bill Warner
on a motorcycle.

59
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:13,413
He's going really fast.

60
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:17,294
In fact, he's going 278 miles per hour,

61
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:20,006
which means that this guy on a motorcycle

62
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:23,962
is traveling faster than my brain
can even figure

63
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:26,837
out what now is.

64
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:31,759
Keep in mind that 250 miles per hour
is the top speed

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,014
for neural impulses within our body.

66
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:38,433
If I tap my nose and tap my toes

67
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:40,353
at the exact same time,

68
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,365
it feels instantaneous,

69
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:46,408
even though there is no physical way
that the brain could actually be receiving that,

70
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,526
because when I tap my nose,
the message goes right into my brain.

71
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:55,408
But when I tap my toes, the message
has to travel across the entire length of my body.

72
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:01,087
The brain waits momentarily to make sure that there's nothing else going on or coming in,

73
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:03,586
and then corroborates all that information

74
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:07,497
and we become aware that the taps were
indeed instantaneous.

75
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:11,083
But we don't become aware of that tap
until the brain is sure,

76
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,131
which means that the taller you are,

77
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:17,605
the longer the brain has to wait
for that physical message to come from your toes,

78
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:23,111
the further behind you technically are
in actually feeling the touch—

79
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:26,433
the further back in the past you're living.

80
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:31,054
When there's a delay like that between
sensory information or brain processing,

81
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:36,285
we become used to that delay and begin
to just see them as instantaneous events,

82
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:38,988
which leads to some weird behavior.

83
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:41,923
If participants are pushing a button

84
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:47,261
that causes a light to flash with a delay
between the two actions of about 80 milliseconds,

85
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,842
they will learn that it's instantaneous.

86
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:53,001
But if the researchers shorten that distance

87
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,892
so that now when the button is pushed, the light
flashes in only—let's say—

88
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:59,055
40 milliseconds, the participants,

89
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:03,779
even though they are actually causing the light to come on
will deny it and they'll say,

90
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,436
"No way! That came on before I pushed the button!
I didn't do it!"

91
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,525
That was also a flash of light.

92
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:13,450
But light bulbs don't receive a continuous

93
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,071
direct stream of electricity through the wire.

94
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:20,587
Instead, they receive alternating current
in most businesses and households.

95
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:23,797
So the filament is actually being excited

96
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:27,251
and left alone about 50 to 60 times a second.

97
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:30,380
But our eyeballs don't notice any flicker for a few reasons.

98
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:33,560
One, it's happening really fast, but
mainly because that filament

99
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:36,841
continues to be super hot during
that little gap in time.

100
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:40,718
The only way to really see this flicker is to use a high frame rate camera

101
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,969
when a light bulb is being turned
on or off so it's cooler.

102
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,929
There's the flicker.

103
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,112
You know what else flickers?

104
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,890
A film projector.

105
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,537
It's easy to think that a film projector works
merely because a roll of film

106
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:56,279
is dragged across a light source, but if that were the case,

107
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,916
a movie screen would be a blur of fast moving images.

108
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,832
Instead, a shudder is used.

109
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,904
The shudder opens and closes

110
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:07,505
to let an image hit the screen, and then when shut,

111
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:11,335
the next image comes into place and it
opens and puts that on the screen.

112
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:13,793
Now, early films were shot at only about

113
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:16,008
16 frames per second.

114
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,669
So sitting in the theater, you would see a bright image

115
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,596
flashed 16 times on the screen, which was not fast enough to not be noticeable.

116
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:25,801
So, movies flickered,

117
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,554
which is why they were called flicks, which is where

118
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,063
we get the word chick flick.

119
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:33,227
All right, I'm gonna go now.

120
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:36,325
And of course, by now, I mean I will leave

121
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:39,495
80 milliseconds before you
become aware that I've left.

122
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:42,668
I put three links to previous
Vsauce videos in the description

123
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,005
that are related to this one if you
haven't seen them yet.

124
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:49,667
One is about why time feels
like it's going faster as we get older.

125
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,085
Another is about the frame rate
of the eyeball,

126
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:55,052
and the other is about the stopped
clock illusion.

127
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:57,379
Have fun, and as always,
thanks for watching.
