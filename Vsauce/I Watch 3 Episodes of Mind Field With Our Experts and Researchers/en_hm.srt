1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,234
(soft music)

2
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:07,439
(eerie sound)

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,339
- Hey Vsauce!

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,407
Michael here.

5
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:12,377
Every episode of Mind
Field is now free to view

6
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:15,780
all over the world, all 24
episodes, all three seasons.

7
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:16,581
Whoa!

8
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:18,283
It is really exciting.

9
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,219
And it's why I've invited you
hear to Vsauce headquarters.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,622
Why watch Mind Field alone
when you could watch it with me

11
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:26,758
and some of the researchers,
writers, scientists

12
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,793
and teachers who
are in the episodes

13
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:30,462
who made Mind Field what it is?

14
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,597
That's right,

15
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,766
we are about to have ourselves
a Mind Field marathon.

16
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:39,270
We are going to watch three
episodes in their entirety,

17
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:41,639
pausing throughout
to talk more deeply

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,208
about the concepts
in the episodes,

19
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,376
it's gonna be very exciting,

20
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,612
and it's all going to happen
right in here, follow me.

21
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:48,480
After you.

22
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:56,321
(eerie sound)

23
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,723
We're going to begin
with an episode

24
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:02,727
that helped new research
happen and improved the lives

25
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,529
of some very special children.

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,368
Season Two, Episode Six,
the Power of Suggestion.

27
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:15,340
(upbeat music)

28
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,643
This is McGill University
in Montreal, Canada.

29
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,245
It boasts and enrollment

30
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,615
of more than 40,000
students from 150 countries,

31
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,484
the campus employs
1700 professors,

32
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:28,753
teaching 300 programs of study,

33
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:31,623
and it's proud to be home
to 12 Nobel Prize winners,

34
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,358
it is considered

35
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,727
one of the finest research
universities in the world.

36
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,495
Recently, researchers at McGill

37
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:40,765
have embarked on a study that
uses a brain scanning device

38
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:44,569
to read people's minds
and implant thoughts

39
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,406
into their heads, or so
their subjects think.

40
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:49,607
Now the same device may be able

41
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:52,377
to help kids with ADHD, anxiety,

42
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,611
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,

43
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:58,683
migraines, Tourette's, and more.

44
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:01,853
This study is not
about technology.

45
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,956
The MRI machine behind
me may look impressive,

46
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:08,760
but it's a sham, it's
deactivated, non functioning.

47
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:14,966
What this study is really
about is faith, in science.

48
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:23,541
It's about the power
of thoughts to heal.

49
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:27,278
All you need is the
power of suggestion.

50
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,880
(machine humming)

51
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:41,993
(upbeat music)

52
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,996
A placebo is something
that shouldn't work,

53
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,465
but due to the
power of suggestion,

54
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:50,401
and because of the strength
of our belief, does,

55
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:53,671
but we don't fully
understand yet how they work,

56
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,674
there could be an
evolutionary explanation.

57
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:59,477
For example, if a small
child hurts themselves,

58
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:03,381
negative symptoms like pain
and crying can be good.

59
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:05,883
They keep the child
safe and still,

60
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,286
while signaling
adults to come help.

61
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:12,290
When help arrives, even if
it has no active effect.

62
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,626
The child's brain may
feel it has permission

63
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,595
to redirect resources
away from seeking help,

64
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:19,998
and on to actually healing.

65
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,699
Modern medicine has
found a way to harness

66
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,303
this power by
prescribing placebos.

67
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,605
But not all placebos
work the same.

68
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:30,642
For example, a sugar pill
will help your headache more

69
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:34,479
if given to you by a doctor
than by a poker buddy,

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,649
and the color of the
placebo matters too.

71
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,652
A blue pill will work
to make you feel calm,

72
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,353
better than a white pill,

73
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:45,056
because blue is a
more calming color.

74
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,692
And a red pill
will keep you awake

75
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:50,528
and give you more energy
than a blue pill will.

76
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:53,431
A capsule will work
better than a pill

77
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:56,467
because it looks more important.

78
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:59,537
(upbeat music)

79
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:00,738
And we're gonna stop right there

80
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,875
because one of my guests
already has a comment.

81
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,644
Let me first introduce
who the guests are.

82
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:10,615
Daniel Toker is a PhD
candidate at Berkeley

83
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,984
who has been writing and
researching for Mind Field

84
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,686
at least season two and three.

85
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:15,953
- Yep.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,722
- Yep, and the Fear
episode season four.

87
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,691
- And the Fear episode,
which isn't even out yet,

88
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,725
but it might be by the
time you watch this,

89
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,727
in which case, it's out already!

90
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,429
Thanks, Daniel.

91
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,764
On the far right side, we
have Elisabeth de Kleer,

92
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:30,668
who worked on season three
as a producer, writer.

93
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,705
She's a science communicator,
science documentary filmmaker,

94
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,440
but I save the middle for last

95
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,108
because Dr. Samuel Veissière

96
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:39,744
from the Culture, Mind and
Brain lab at McGill University,

97
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,779
one of the CO directors is here.

98
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,348
And he's also going
to be featured

99
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,615
quite prominently
in this episode.

100
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,084
You'll see him soon.

101
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,420
And he is the one who
told me, Stop let's talk,

102
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,556
because we're gonna
talk about placebos.

103
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,393
And I just mentioned in the
episode that the color of a pill

104
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:58,396
affects how it
can make you feel.

105
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:00,898
A blue pill will tend
to be more calming

106
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:03,434
because so many of us
associate blue with calming.

107
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,069
However, we need to be,

108
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,138
when you put a star
on so many of us.

109
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,773
- Yeah, so reportedly in Italy,

110
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,541
blue pills don't
have a calming effect

111
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:13,544
because people
associate the color blue

112
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:16,881
with the soccer jersey of
the national soccer team.

113
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,649
So they tend to associate it

114
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,953
with a kind of a feeling of
arousal and not calmness.

115
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,588
So it's interesting
to try to parse out,

116
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,823
the different effects
of some colors.

117
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,658
Red seems fairly universal

118
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:33,898
as something that triggers
high arousal, but not blue.

119
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,667
- Is that because red is the
color of blood, you think?

120
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:37,602
- I'm really not sure.

121
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,837
I mean, as you know,

122
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,005
we seem to have some inbuilt
attentional biases towards red

123
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,741
like say the little buzzing
red lights on smartphones

124
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,076
works really well that way

125
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:47,612
because we tend to
automatically attend to them.

126
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,148
It could be blood,
yeah, could be fire even

127
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,551
because we also have an
attentional bias towards fire.

128
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,787
- Wait, but how
universal is this?

129
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:02,427
Have studies looked
at Papua New Guinea

130
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,061
and populations there that
don't watch the movies

131
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,496
and don't have the stories

132
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:08,699
that we have in
America or in Europe?

133
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,036
I mean, is this something
that, you said in built?

134
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,471
Is it really?

135
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,539
- I'm not aware of
all the studies,

136
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,674
I think red for
sure is something

137
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:20,812
for which we have a relatively
innate attentional bias,

138
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,515
red processeses salient
in the environment.

139
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:27,018
- This is so much of it
depends on the person,

140
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,621
like there could be a
person here in America

141
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:32,123
for whom red is really calming

142
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:34,725
because of their
particular circumstances.

143
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:35,593
- Yeah, it's actually funny,

144
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:37,495
I just got back from
China yesterday.

145
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:38,630
So I flew in.

146
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,831
And one of the things you
notice even from the sky,

147
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,232
looking down over Chinese cities

148
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:45,136
is how much red lighting
there is, big red LEDs.

149
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,805
And so I associate red
with stop, like if red,

150
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:50,575
it's meant to catch
my attention, It's
sort of alarming.

151
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,843
But in China actually,
it's ubiquitous.

152
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,979
And it's more just like
a color of good luck.

153
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,015
Most restaurants
have their title

154
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,017
of the restaurant in red.

155
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:01,986
So it's also meant to
catch your attention,

156
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,755
to simulate arousal but in
less of like a negative way

157
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:07,658
that it can sometimes be
here in the United States,

158
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,560
so red street sign isn't
necessarily gonna be.

159
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,996
- So probably the emotional
valence is conditioned

160
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:14,665
and culturally
contingent on some level.

161
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,567
But that red is
gonna be salient,

162
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:19,070
is gonna be something that we
can automatically attend to.

163
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,271
That's fairly universal.

164
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:23,140
- And once we attend to it,
how we feel may depend a lot

165
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:24,575
on the culture that we're from.

166
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,010
- Right.

167
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,679
- But I think the point is
that even things like the color

168
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,780
and size and shape of a pill

169
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:32,884
and who gives it to you
will affect how it works.

170
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,720
It's not just the chemical
properties of the medicine,

171
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,723
there's so much more, so
much in the mental world.

172
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,858
- Well, I mean, but that also
is chemical ultimately, right?

173
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,561
Because if it's a
blue pill or red pill,

174
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,663
that's gonna affect your
neuro chemistry in some way.

175
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:47,665
- And you know what,
why is it red or blue?

176
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,601
Because of the physical
shape of the molecules,

177
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:51,636
The shape?
- Right.

178
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,604
- Wow!

179
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,640
So, right, I guess this
is gonna be a question

180
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,474
I wanna keep coming back to

181
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,576
how do we really
define a placebo?

182
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:01,178
Because I think in the episode,

183
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,582
I say something like
there's no active ingredient

184
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,584
that should cause that effect.

185
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,819
But yet, if a pill is calming,

186
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,987
because it happens to be blue,

187
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,322
because its molecular structure

188
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,024
reflects blue light the best,

189
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,127
then there is something
chemically in that pill

190
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,828
that works in calming you.

191
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,865
And it's not because
the ingestion helps,

192
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,567
it's just the color alone.

193
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,668
- Right, right.

194
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,170
I guess it's easier to
define what's not a placebo,

195
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,673
as something that works
better than a placebo?

196
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,175
- Well, that's why another
term for placebo effects

197
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,278
are nonspecific effects,
or nonspecific factors.

198
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,581
So whatever factors
involved in healing

199
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,584
that we cannot attribute
to the chemical substance

200
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,985
that is targeted
in the treatment.

201
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:44,689
And there are also non specific
effects in psychotherapy

202
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,794
even that are, so tone of
voice setting, waiting times.

203
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,862
So placebo is
really a filler term

204
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:56,033
for all these different
psychosocial symbolic
ritual factors

205
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:57,602
that we don't fully understand,

206
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,204
but that we know contribute
to a cure somehow.

207
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,339
- Right?

208
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,276
So those are called non
specific, the specific ones.

209
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:07,612
How are they defined they are.

210
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,913
- So the specific one would be

211
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:11,182
the actual analgesic
property of a pill,

212
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,184
for example, has been
well studied in RCT,

213
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,920
we know it produces that effect.

214
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,723
But then we know that there
are other effects around

215
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,859
and beyond that, that also
contribute to healing.

216
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,662
And in the case of an
actual placebo procedure,

217
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:27,198
where we know that
specific molecule

218
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,433
is not actually
present in the pill,

219
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,737
but healing will still happen,
then we need to investigate

220
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,939
these different effects,
these different factors.

221
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,374
That are nonspecific.

222
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,710
- Maybe this works,
a nonspecific,

223
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:43,848
non placebo effect of a
medicine would be what works,

224
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,283
even when it's administered
to someone in a coma,

225
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:47,685
who doesn't know
what's happening,

226
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,820
doesn't know who's
administering it.

227
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:53,190
But we know that that
molecule in the blood

228
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:56,027
causes blood
pressure to go down,

229
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,930
or whatever, causes pain to
be felt less, I don't know.

230
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,400
- But be careful
because there are,

231
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,402
placebo effects have
been found, for example,

232
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,004
in nonverbal autistic children,

233
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:10,408
who for sure cannot understand
the nature of the suggestion,

234
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,411
because, of course, if you
have some kind of an idea

235
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,281
about a therapeutic target
and a mechanism of action,

236
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,449
so I have a headache,

237
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,550
and this one pill
removes the headache,

238
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:22,153
then that will greatly
help in the placebo effect.

239
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,723
But what about the case of
autistic nonverbal children

240
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,325
who have no idea, who
don't expect anything,

241
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,526
and yet there's an effect,

242
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,396
there's a social cognitive
component to placebo effects,

243
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:33,397
you have to be able to expect

244
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:36,333
what other people expect
of you even implicitly.

245
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,736
So probably in the case of the
nonverbal autistic children,

246
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:41,472
it's also say, the reassuring
tone of voice of the parent,

247
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:43,441
the parents shifted
expectations,

248
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,077
the sort of contagious
hope that might work.

249
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,814
And the same mechanism,
same social mechanism

250
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,017
might be involved in dogs and
in advanced social species

251
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:56,387
through observation and kind
of social emotional contagion.

252
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,888
- Very cool.

253
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:58,789
All right, guys, let's
get back into the episode.

254
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,290
You ready?

255
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,392
Here we go.

256
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:04,829
Also, an injection will
work better than a capsule,

257
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,066
because it seems more
serious and potent.

258
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,401
There's even evidence that fake

259
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,738
or Sham surgeries
have positive effects.

260
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,174
It may be fake medicine,
but the effects can be real.

261
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,409
And not just because the patient

262
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,044
feels better psychologically,

263
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,413
we're talking real
physical healing,

264
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:25,449
thanks to the
power of the brain.

265
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,383
- [Dr. Samuel] So
again, briefly,

266
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:27,318
can I say something Michael?

267
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,519
- [Michael] Yeah, let's stop.

268
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,620
- Well, I'm really glad
you're pointing out

269
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,489
all these different
dimensions of placebo effects

270
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,190
the take home point here is that

271
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:36,327
the more elaborate the
procedure, the better it works.

272
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,864
And by elaborate I mean, so
technologically elaborate,

273
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,066
but also motivationally
elaborate.

274
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,434
So if it hurts a little bit,

275
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,402
if you have to wait
a long time for it,

276
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:49,039
if it seems really
symbolically prominent also.

277
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,243
So whatever prestige might
be attached to a procedure

278
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,912
that will tend to work better
and also socially elaborate.

279
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:58,215
So if you can notice
improvements in other people,

280
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:00,484
preferably people like you,
people from your in group,

281
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:02,920
you can talk to them,
that will also help

282
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,955
prepare you for the
placebo response.

283
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,490
- It's amazing.

284
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,793
It makes it feel like why
even study real medicine,

285
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,562
when so much of just the
way people think about it,

286
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,997
can make a difference.

287
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,398
Clearly, there are
limits to that.

288
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,400
And I wanna revisit that
when we start looking

289
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:19,537
at the actual study that
we did in this episode,

290
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,971
because talk about

291
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:24,575
making it feel
technologically interesting.

292
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,310
We've got a whole
film crew there.

293
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:29,280
Why would a film crew be here
unless it's gonna work well?

294
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,448
We'll talk about that soon.

295
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,318
We'll get right back into
it, The Power of Suggestion.

296
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,087
I traveled to Montreal
to meet local children

297
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,156
struggling with
debilitating behavioral

298
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:42,193
and neurological conditions,
who would soon find out

299
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,428
whether their afflictions
could be cured

300
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,463
by the power of suggestion.

301
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:47,398
- This is Malaya.

302
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,567
- Malaya, I'm Michael
Nice to meet you.

303
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,602
12 year old Malaya suffers

304
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:54,371
from a common skin
ailment, eczema,

305
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,541
but she has also developed
a skin picking disorder.

306
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,910
Dermatillomania.

307
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,278
And you're starting High School.

308
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,315
What like this year?
- Early September?

309
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,283
- Wow, that's a big step.

310
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,586
So what kind of
things worry you?

311
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,554
Given the symptoms
that you have?

312
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:13,190
- Probably the picking--
- Of your skin?

313
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:15,960
- Yeah, I don't know, I
find it satisfying to pick.

314
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,328
It's kind of gross.

315
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,429
- Why do you can't stop?

316
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,097
- I'm not sure.

317
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:23,901
- Have you tried different
things that will help you stop?

318
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:25,269
- Yeah, like in my mind,

319
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,872
I'm just like, today,
you won't pick.

320
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,007
You are gonna get
rid of this eczema.

321
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,475
And then after I'm just like,

322
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:33,577
Oh, wait, my face was bleeding.

323
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:35,446
- Yeah, is it embarrassing?

324
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,615
- Yeah, I like to
wear long sleeves

325
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,284
because my arms are like,
if they're really bad,

326
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:41,552
I'm gonna try to
wear long sleeves.

327
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,088
- How are your arms now?

328
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,590
- It's like really bad,
so, as you can see.

329
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,893
- And that's all just from
scratching and picking.

330
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,661
- Yeah.

331
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:52,897
- 12 year old
Nicholas was troubled

332
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,532
by debilitating
migraine headaches.

333
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,601
So what do you wanna
be when you grow up?

334
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,237
- Like I really, really wanna be

335
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:03,440
probably a NHL and MOV
player, one of those two.

336
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,276
- Nicholas's love of sports

337
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:09,546
is unfortunately also
the original source
of his suffering.

338
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:10,547
Nice.

339
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:13,550
- My first head injury
which was concussion,

340
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:15,419
I hit my head on a soccer post,

341
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,589
and then I hit my head
in a game of hockey.

342
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,225
After that I had headaches
every single day.

343
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:23,694
I was throwing up having auras.

344
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,963
They're like colors
that you seen

345
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:27,231
before you have a headache.

346
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,599
I wasn't able to go to school,

347
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,467
and then we went to the hospital

348
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:32,636
and into their
concussion program.

349
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,672
- Can I see his migraine chart?

350
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:38,542
- Oh sure, yeah, we have
almost two years worth.

351
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,010
severe headaches here.

352
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:41,512
Severe migraines.
- Every day.

353
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:46,250
- Every single day, this has
turned his world upside down.

354
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,986
- Nathan was diagnosed with ADHD

355
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:51,522
and impulse control disorder.

356
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,124
I'd love to hear especially
about you, Nathan.

357
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,359
First of all, how old are you?

358
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,527
- Nine.
- Nine.

359
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,962
- How old you are? '

360
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,229
- [Michael] How old
do you think I am?

361
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,431
- 30.

362
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,633
- That's a very
good guess, I'm 31.

363
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,335
- Oh!

364
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,637
- So, tell me about like
before Nathan's diagnosis.

365
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:09,606
What were kind of the
symptoms you were seeing?

366
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:13,410
- Tantrums all the time.

367
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,179
Just an inability to reach him,

368
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,581
to communicate to him,
to connect to him.

369
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:18,749
That was the main symptom.

370
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,217
- And what did you
think of this Nathan?

371
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:23,487
Were you like, why are
my parents not happy?

372
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,589
- 'Cause I was not listening?

373
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,557
- Why weren't you?

374
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:31,562
- I don't know, maybe
because I had problems.

375
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,231
- And as far as like behavior.

376
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,467
- Impulsivity, hyperactivity,

377
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,602
you're always, always on
the edge, always stressed.

378
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:39,636
What is he gonna touch?

379
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:40,471
Where is he gonna go?

380
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,772
What is he gonna do?

381
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:44,375
- These families had
tried conventional methods

382
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,578
to treat their children
with little success.

383
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,014
But they were about to find
out whether their symptoms

384
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,784
could be alleviated using an
accessory assisted placebo,

385
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:56,653
a fake non functioning
MRI machine.

386
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:59,556
This groundbreaking study
of the power of suggestion

387
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:02,693
in action is the brainchild
of pioneering researchers

388
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:06,497
at McGill University's
esteemed Raz Lab,

389
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,664
- We study a whole bunch

390
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,666
of different Mind,
Body interaction topics

391
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,403
suggestion, hypnosis,
placebo effects,

392
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,773
anytime the mind is regulating
the body or vice versa,

393
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,274
that that's a
topic that we study

394
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,443
- Now, you said
the word placebo.

395
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:25,315
And the device that we are
using is a sham scanner.

396
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:26,583
Tell me about the scanner.

397
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,485
- What we do with
the MRI scanner is

398
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:32,189
we stack so many different
layers of deception.

399
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,691
In their head, this is a
proper neuroscience study

400
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,527
done at the
Neurological Institute.

401
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,362
And that's why we
wear a lab coats.

402
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:41,131
That's why we have all of this
scientific looking equipment.

403
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,167
By the time they've
actually started the study.

404
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,636
They've already in
their mind built up

405
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,504
all these different
layers of credibility.

406
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:50,507
They really believe that
what we're doing is real.

407
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:52,476
- What's interesting
is that children

408
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:55,279
they're not immune to the
power of neuro enchantment

409
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,414
- Neuro enchantment?
- Neuro enchantment.

410
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:58,248
- What does that mean?

411
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,450
- So it's this idea

412
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,785
that there is some
kind of medical magic,

413
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,588
there is immense
power that is attached

414
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,356
to the culture of neuroscience,

415
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:09,760
whereby neuro scientific
props and accessories,

416
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:13,497
have more healing power,
more physiological effects,

417
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:16,567
because culturally, people
believe that they do.

418
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,269
I mean, the same kinds of
cultural cognitive mechanisms

419
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,605
are at play in
religious systems.

420
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,140
So here we are praying

421
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:26,210
to the gods of neuroscience,
and biomedicine.

422
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,545
- Talk to me about
the ethics of lying.

423
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:30,347
- The work we do with children

424
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,882
actually does not involve lying,

425
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,585
we tell them at first that
everything that they see

426
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,819
and everything that
we do in the lab

427
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,855
is a suggestion we
explained to them,

428
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,456
that suggestion is a way to tap

429
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,425
into the power of their mind.

430
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,894
And we keep emphasizing even
as they go in the scanner,

431
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:46,330
that it is their
mind and their brain

432
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,465
that is doing the healing,

433
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:51,401
that they're basically
reprogramming their own brain.

434
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:54,404
- The parents knew that
the scanner was a placebo.

435
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,439
But for the study to work,

436
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,675
the children had to
believe in the procedure.

437
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:00,577
So before they visited the lab,

438
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,546
I enlisted a few
YouTuber friends

439
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:06,150
to help raise
their expectations.

440
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,219
- Hey, guys, today, we have
a huge surprise for you

441
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,821
about something
brand new in science

442
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:12,456
that could affect your day.

443
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:13,657
- Oh, I know them.

444
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:16,326
- Well, today, we learned
about this amazing new machine

445
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,396
that teaches kids brain
how to heal super fast,

446
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:21,632
- We really hope that you
get a chance in person

447
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,267
to see how this machine works.

448
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,335
- With a little help
from the machine,

449
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,503
you can focus better, you
can be more confident,

450
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,205
and it can even take
away some headaches.

451
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:29,339
- Awesome.

452
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,374
- Not too many
people get the chance

453
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,342
to have this awesome experience,

454
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,711
but we hear the
scientists in Canada--

455
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:38,348
- I gonna have it?
- Yeah, and it's very cool.

456
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:41,485
So what do you hope the
machine allows you to do?

457
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:42,520
It makes you better at.

458
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,756
- Better at concentrating,
better at focusing.

459
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:50,394
- I wanna heal faster, and
this probably be a good idea.

460
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,863
- All right, so I wanna talk
about a couple of things.

461
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,499
One, this episode
is really different

462
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,633
from a lot of Mind
Field episodes,

463
00:18:56,634 --> 00:19:01,238
because we're
treating people in it.

464
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,707
And we're following
their stories.

465
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,244
A ungenerous way to look at
this is that in this episode,

466
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:09,880
we're lying to children

467
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,916
and performing fake
medicine on children.

468
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,285
Dr. Veissière, what
are your thoughts?

469
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:18,222
- So if you carefully examine
what we say, it is correct

470
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,691
that we never tell a lie,

471
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,594
that we explain the
mechanism correctly.

472
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,729
However, to be
completely honest,

473
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,601
we do probably rely
on the children's

474
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,403
to some extent uncritical faith

475
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:34,938
in the healing
power of the machine

476
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:37,574
on the one hand,
and their own brain.

477
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:41,411
And this is because we know it
is very effective for people

478
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:43,013
to be able to
relax their worries

479
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:44,881
and their critical
thinking and to surrender

480
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,550
to some kind of an
idea that they have

481
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,518
of an external locus of control.

482
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,356
Now, note here how both
the brain and the machine

483
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,325
are basically an agency other
than their conscious self.

484
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,927
So we tell them,

485
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:57,928
the machine will help
your brain heal itself,

486
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,664
it is your brain that
is doing the healing.

487
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:02,899
But it is much more efficient,

488
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,968
for the children to
at least initially

489
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:08,038
believe that the machine has
some kind of special power.

490
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,674
- I think I even remember you
telling me that you would tell

491
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:13,644
the parents flat out the
machines not even plugged in.

492
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,680
And then the next day that
they came in, they would say,

493
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,914
but is this safe?

494
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,516
Because how can it be safe?

495
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:21,551
We're in the basement
of a neuroscience lab,

496
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:24,554
and this machine is really big
and noises are being played.

497
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,023
- Not even that they would ask,

498
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,859
so did you find out what's
wrong with my child's brain?

499
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,595
They wanted us to comment
on neuro imaging results.

500
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,630
And we would have to
pull them aside again

501
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,831
and say do to remember?

502
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:36,633
We're not doing
actual neuro imaging,

503
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:39,569
we're not, you've competent
to comment on findings

504
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,738
that are not even there,
they would forget.

505
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,507
- They would forget,

506
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,608
- They would forget because
all the queues are in place.

507
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:49,313
And I think it would demand
so much mental effort

508
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,381
to remember that this is sham,

509
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,685
that people revert to a kind
of adaptive self deception.

510
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,687
So this is also what
we're aiming for.

511
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,588
We're aiming to tap into
the children's ability

512
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:01,825
to self deceive, which we
know can be very effective,

513
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,660
like say, if you're
really, really nervous

514
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,696
before giving a talk,
and then you managed

515
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,497
to convince yourself
that you're not nervous,

516
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:10,334
then lo and behold, you
start feeling confident.

517
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,036
Now initially, there might
have been some self deception.

518
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,938
But then if the
results are good,

519
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,707
then it's no longer deception.

520
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,443
- This is what I really
love about all the episodes

521
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,712
and all the work that
we've done together.

522
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,582
Because we also worked
on the reverse exorcism

523
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:30,620
putting a spirit in
someone that, okay.

524
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:33,724
In a way, we're almost
finding some truth

525
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,926
to pseudo scientific practices.

526
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:42,132
If I have some mental block
or some behavior I don't want.

527
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:46,403
And my mother takes me
to a person who prays

528
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:49,806
to crystals and whatever,

529
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,975
that crystal has no
chemical mechanism

530
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,710
with which to help me.

531
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:59,649
However, if I truly believe
that this is significant,

532
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,617
and I noticed that
I'm being cared for

533
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:01,885
that people care so much,

534
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,720
and I think so much
more about my behavior,

535
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:07,691
because of all of that, I
can actually get better.

536
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:08,626
And that's what
we're doing here.

537
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,628
But instead of using
crystals, and whatever,

538
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:17,834
we're using science looking
stuff, lab coats, and an MRI,

539
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:22,072
and imaging of brains on
the computer screens around

540
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,708
and it just feels like this
must be serious and real.

541
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,577
But in reality, they may
as well be laying on a bed

542
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:30,547
while someone sings
nonsense words to them.

543
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:32,682
- And I like the
parallel that you draw.

544
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:35,118
It's true that a lot of
spiritual healing practices

545
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,922
they draw on these
transitional objects,

546
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:41,024
you could call them so
things like amulets,

547
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:43,760
or stones or rocks,
or even magic,

548
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:47,764
crosses that people can sort
of attribute healing power to

549
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:49,566
without having to worry,

550
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,869
it becomes a convenient way
to instill hope in people.

551
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,505
- All right, let's get
right back into it.

552
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:57,607
- I hope he heals me
with my concussions

553
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:01,178
and now I hope my
headaches go away.

554
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,014
- I was about to take part
in something remarkable.

555
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,717
The very first use of
accessory assisted suggestion

556
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:10,554
on children with these
kinds of symptoms.

557
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,924
Mind Field would play an
integral role in the study,

558
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,928
and the results could be new
and significant for science.

559
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,665
(upbeat music)

560
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,633
On the day of the first session,

561
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,669
several measures
were put in place

562
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,905
to heighten the children's
neuro enchantment.

563
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:30,941
- Nathan.

564
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,108
- Nathan!

565
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,878
- [Michael] A
friendly fake nurse,

566
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:38,582
a walk down a long,
impressive hallway

567
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,817
(Malaya exhaling)

568
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:44,688
And a 10 minute anticipation
building wait outside the lab,

569
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,157
then it was time for
their first scan.

570
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:48,592
- [Doctor] Shall we?

571
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,493
- [Michael] While the hypothesis

572
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,761
of this study was
grounded in science.

573
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,964
This was Dr. Veissière
and Jay Olsen's

574
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,099
first time testing their theory

575
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,002
on real children
with real disorders.

576
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:01,204
And they didn't know
if it would work.

577
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:02,372
- You may lay down
if you'd like.

578
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,774
- I have a question, so it
seems to me that placebos work,

579
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,710
in part, because
people these subjects

580
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,080
have a lot of faith
in medical science.

581
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,014
Did you study that at all?

582
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:12,616
Or ask them at all about that?

583
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,753
I mean, and I guess
my question is,

584
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,655
for somebody who's very
skeptical of medical science,

585
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:21,992
who doesn't feel like doctors
are working to their benefit,

586
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,661
would they still be as
susceptible to a placebo?

587
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,596
- Well, a lot of
people might say

588
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,098
they're critical
of medical science.

589
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,567
But for example, if they
have acute appendicitis,

590
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:34,237
their first intuition
will be to rush to the ER.

591
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:37,707
And for belief to
be really effective,

592
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,776
it needs to be
culturally widespread.

593
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:41,878
And we happen to live
in a historical moment

594
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:47,817
where most of the solutions
to our everyday ailments

595
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:49,586
are deemed to be
found in medicine,

596
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,888
and children are receptive
to these kinds of cues,

597
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:54,024
even implicitly, even if they
don't know that they know.

598
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,860
So I think, try it out
at home for example,

599
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:58,562
if you have like a
five year old niece,

600
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,031
show her a picture of a builder,

601
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,199
and then a doctor
with a stethoscope

602
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,102
and ask your niece, which
one is the smartest?

603
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:08,104
For sure they're gonna
point to the doctor,

604
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:10,240
because they've picked up
on a cultural consensus

605
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:14,077
that this is where,
elaborate knowledge lies.

606
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:17,080
At the same time, I'm
not aware of any studies,

607
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,316
testing medical
placebos on people

608
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,318
who are really
skeptical of medicine

609
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,320
who are completely into
alternative medicine,

610
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,022
it may be that it
wouldn't work with them.

611
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,191
I think it's a good hypothesis.

612
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,794
- Also, is there such a
thing as an anti placebo?

613
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,729
Where (laughs) and
what I mean by that?

614
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,165
- For sure.
- Yeah okay.

615
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,768
So that's like somebody
who's skeptical,

616
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:40,303
so even something that's potent,

617
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:43,173
even if you give them a potent
drug, they don't react to it,

618
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,307
because they're so
skeptical about it--

619
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:45,609
- Yeah, right,
that's another thing,

620
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,344
nocebo is something different.

621
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,545
What is that, though?

622
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:53,650
Where, because of all the
done specific crap surrounding

623
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:58,388
a chemical mechanism that
should work, it works less well,

624
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:01,124
because of the context.

625
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,392
- That's really interesting.

626
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,794
Yeah, that might very,
very interesting.

627
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:06,296
And it may be that people

628
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:08,698
who are a little too high
in analytical reasoning,

629
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:10,400
people who are not
very suggestible,

630
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,403
people who are not very
prone to social influence,

631
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:17,407
may also reverse placebo
themselves inadvertently,

632
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:18,608
because they're too critical

633
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:22,712
because they can't let the
self regulatory magic happen.

634
00:26:22,713 --> 00:26:24,881
But it could be that
at the social level,

635
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:26,983
or naive beliefs in
some things like say,

636
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,351
some categories of illness

637
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:30,754
that may not be
scientifically validated.

638
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,689
But just because people believe
they have these symptoms,

639
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,658
like say, certain
food intolerances,

640
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,694
or certain allergies that
appear to be on the rise.

641
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:39,663
Well, there's some
psychogenic factors involved

642
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,997
in that and then might
have something to do

643
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:43,700
with collective nocebo effects.

644
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:46,870
And then the next problem
is also letting people know

645
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,873
that they're genetically at
risk for a particular condition,

646
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,409
sometimes may
trigger the symptoms,

647
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,411
or may even trigger
the condition

648
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:58,081
in a way that not knowing
might have been better.

649
00:26:58,082 --> 00:26:59,449
- Ignorance is bliss--

650
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,384
- Ignorance is often bliss.

651
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,452
- I think it's very
ethically tricky, then.

652
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:03,720
- It's very ethically tricky,

653
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,789
because you have to tell people,

654
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,025
but then there are also risks
associated with telling.

655
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:10,026
- That's why you
might not wanna do

656
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,428
a personal genetics test,

657
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,129
- Right?

658
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,031
Well, we're about to test
that in the lab as well,

659
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:16,366
because we think
there's interesting

660
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,901
neuro enchantment effects

661
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,170
associated with
belief in genetics.

662
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,338
So we're about to do a study

663
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:24,841
with Sham personalized feedback.

664
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:32,949
So Sham, swab and genetic.

665
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,251
it's a placebo
analgesia condition.

666
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:37,487
So we give people
a shock and pain.

667
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:40,724
And we tell them that
in one condition,

668
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,459
we've tailored the machine

669
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,729
to one particular genetic
polymorphous that they have,

670
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,797
and we fully expect
that is gonna work

671
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:50,734
better in that condition,
but we haven't tested it yet.

672
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,402
And then eventually,
one of our dreams

673
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:54,471
is to also test in a kind of,

674
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:57,307
three on trial to
do Sham neuroimaging

675
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,142
versus Sham genetic testing

676
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,111
to see which one has
the strongest effect.

677
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:01,678
- Ah!

678
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,379
What's your hypothesis?

679
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,848
Which do you think we as
a society believe more in?

680
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,318
Neuroimaging or genetic testing?

681
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,452
- I'm really not sure,

682
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:11,888
I think we're moving towards

683
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,823
believing more in
genetic testing,

684
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:16,893
but the belief might
still be culturally new.

685
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:19,362
Whereas belief in the
power of neuroscience

686
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,297
are very well
installed culturally,

687
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:25,268
we're more than, two decades
after the decade of the brain.

688
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:26,503
So I would say in 10 years,

689
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,305
it'll probably be
genetic testing.

690
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:33,009
For now, it depends
on levels of exposure.

691
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,844
But for sure, like
say for children,

692
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:37,280
the idea of a gene is
still very, very opaque,

693
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:38,915
very nebulous, very esoteric,

694
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,784
whereas putting them in
this enormous machine

695
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,419
and this authoritative
hospital might--

696
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,955
- Might always be better than
just swabbing their mouth

697
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:47,357
and telling them something.

698
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,425
Let's get back into the
episode, you guys ready?

699
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:50,927
Okay, here we go.

700
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:52,896
One of my roles was
to help build up

701
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,099
the children's belief
that it would work.

702
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,036
As you go into the machine,
you'll relax more and more.

703
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:03,873
Would you like to relax
slowly or quickly today?

704
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,341
- I can go in quickly,

705
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:07,243
- Quickly?
- Oh, Wow, nice.

706
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:08,378
- Very good.

707
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,081
Although the MRI scanner
was completely deactivated,

708
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:17,420
we needed the kids to believe
it was fully functional.

709
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,956
So Jay played a series of
realistic sound effects

710
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,458
to signify that the
machine was working.

711
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:24,828
While Dr. Veissière
planted the suggestion

712
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,529
that it would help
the patient heal.

713
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,534
- You may notice some unusual
feelings, perhaps a tingling,

714
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:35,405
your brain is continuing
to learn and to heal.

715
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:41,444
And to help you find this
constant feeling of confidence.

716
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:42,445
- [Michael] If all went well,

717
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:45,114
the placebo effect of
the Sham brain scanner

718
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:47,851
would convince the
children's conscious minds

719
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,886
that real neuroscience
was at work.

720
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:52,021
- A deep, deep breath.

721
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:54,490
- [Michael] This would allow
their subconscious minds

722
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:58,261
to harness the power of their
brains to heal themselves.

723
00:29:58,262 --> 00:30:00,530
- For people with migraines,
it's often in the front

724
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:03,066
or the back part of the
head but it could also be

725
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,968
like a feeling like
outside the head.

726
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,636
So I'm not sure what it's
gonna be like for you.

727
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,171
We'll find out afterwards.

728
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:10,640
So we'll now slide you in.

729
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,208
- Cool, it's like
a roller coaster.

730
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,943
I love roller coasters.

731
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:16,145
- The deeper you go in,
the more you'll relax.

732
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:21,050
- Okay, I wanna go
all the way deep

733
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:23,253
I feel more stronger beeps.

734
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,487
- I know

735
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:26,456
this is because you're
already at level three.

736
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:31,594
You might notice a deeper
feeling of relaxation.

737
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:34,097
- [Nathan] Yes, I can feel it.

738
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,399
Can we go a little
bit deeper please?

739
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,402
- [Michael] Yes.

740
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,938
- [Nathan] I want
my whole entire feet

741
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,172
Nice.

742
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:44,407
- [Michael] The
scientists at McGill

743
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:47,577
believe the children's brains
have always had the ability

744
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:49,612
to control their symptoms.

745
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:52,482
The children just needed
to believe it themselves.

746
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,317
(Nathan sneezing)

747
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:55,285
- [Dr. Veissière]
Yeah, so the beeps

748
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,453
can sometimes make people sneeze

749
00:30:57,454 --> 00:31:03,059
as a sign that they're
relaxing just very deeply.

750
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,227
Right?

751
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:06,496
Very well, you did
very, very well Nathan.

752
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,299
- [Michael] The children all
appear to enjoy the procedure

753
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,100
and the researchers
and I did our best

754
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,436
to reinforce their
neuro enchantment.

755
00:31:13,437 --> 00:31:15,571
- So when you heard the
the first set of beeps

756
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:17,473
and the second set of beeps

757
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:20,143
Did you notice feeling them in
different parts of your body?

758
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,078
- Well, the first time
I went in the machine,

759
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,579
I kind of felt the hair.

760
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,447
- Okay, good.

761
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:27,350
- What level was
she taken to today?

762
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:28,618
- Level two.

763
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:29,753
- Level two!

764
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,321
- [Dr. Veissière] Yeah,
level two is great, yeah.

765
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,588
- [Michael] Yeah.

766
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:33,456
- When I was in the
machine, I felt like

767
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,591
I was going backwards
and forwards.

768
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:38,561
- Okay, that's very good,
that's very good sign.

769
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,496
You might have noticed
how you were yawning.

770
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:43,199
- I wanna go to sleep.

771
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,001
- That's great.

772
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,536
- [Michael] For a kid
with hyperactivity,

773
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,539
Nathan was already
appearing calmer.

774
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,141
But before our young
subjects left the lab,

775
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:55,278
Dr. Veissière bolstered the
suggestion that today's session

776
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,614
would help them continue
their healing process.

777
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:01,684
- So I know for sure that
you're gonna be more relaxed,

778
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:05,621
much, much less anxious, I
would not be surprised at all.

779
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:09,525
If the scratching
really diminished to
no scratching at all.

780
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,527
The amazing thing
about the brain

781
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:14,998
is that it has this fantastic
power to heal itself.

782
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,666
But now what we've
been able to do here

783
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,502
with the power of suggestion
is to get your brain

784
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:22,638
to work faster and
better all the time.

785
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:24,107
So how do you feel?

786
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,074
- Amazing.

787
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:26,676
- [Dr. Veissière] Oh, nice.

788
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:28,611
- [Michael] Mind Field
provided the Raz Lab

789
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:32,048
with Octopus by
Joy, Smartwatches.

790
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,282
- [Nathan] Lefty rules.

791
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:34,584
- [Michael] They were
specially programmed

792
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,086
to remind the children
in between visits,

793
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:40,056
that their brain
was healing itself.

794
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,092
- Just having the watch with
you will make you feel better.

795
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,495
But it's not the watch,
or it's not the machine

796
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,531
that's making you feel
good, it's your own brain.

797
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:51,267
- Okay, I just stopped
it, because I wanna say,

798
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,336
at this time when
this was filmed,

799
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:57,106
smart watches were like a
whole cool brand new thing.

800
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:59,409
Everyone was excited,
the kids were like Oh!

801
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,745
And we had to be like, it's
not like an Apple Watch,

802
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:05,648
it's just for your brain
health, which is better.

803
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:06,549
Tell me about the watches,

804
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,483
because I don't
think in the episode,

805
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:10,386
we focused enough on
what their role was.

806
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:12,388
- The idea was to work
on placebo conditioning.

807
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:15,358
So first we enlisted a
response in the scanner,

808
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,593
with a mixture of
hypnotic suggestions,

809
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:19,495
anticipation and all the
effects that you showed.

810
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:23,666
Now once we've found a target
response, like say relaxation,

811
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,202
or self regulation
some other way,

812
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:27,637
then we get the
kids to expect that

813
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,505
when they receive a little
buzz from the watch.

814
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,607
They're going to
keep experiencing

815
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:33,342
whatever effect
we were listening.

816
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:39,515
So usually respect, relaxation,
focus, and so forth.

817
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,417
So then we programmed
different delivery schedules

818
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:43,453
for the children where they
would get a little buzz

819
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,688
and a little friendly icon

820
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,623
and then it would remind them
Oh, I guess I'm doing great.

821
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:48,558
And then we had them come back

822
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,159
after two weeks in the library,

823
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,628
I would decrease the delivery
schedule of the buzzes

824
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:55,531
because I didn't want them to
become too addicted to them.

825
00:33:55,532 --> 00:33:57,166
And eventually
after a third week,

826
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,434
there would be no more buzzes.

827
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:00,403
So they could play
around with the icons,

828
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:04,674
because I didn't want them
to rely on the buzzes.

829
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,209
But then yeah, as
you pointed out,

830
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,410
a lot of the kids still
wanted to have the watch

831
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:12,180
as a kind of a transitional
object like a little blanky,

832
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:14,117
that helps you
sleep or an amulet

833
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,319
or a special ring
that people have.

834
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,254
- You may have heard
us say a few times.

835
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:20,390
Oh, you're at level three.

836
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,426
Today, you got to level
two, is completely made up.

837
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:24,794
There were no levels.

838
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:29,198
But yet the kids really
read a lot into that.

839
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,167
- And then they became
more and more proud

840
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,834
each time they know
they went deeper.

841
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:34,736
And they surrender
themselves to the--

842
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:37,840
- Well, of course they did
because no matter what happened

843
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:40,676
or how they felt they
were told that's good.

844
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:43,513
Oh, wonderful, oh, really?

845
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,648
- We were validating
everything they felt.

846
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:46,616
- Every thing.

847
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,151
- Was the level thing planned?

848
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,685
Or what that
improvised on camera?

849
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:52,588
- No, we kind of I think
we improvised it on camera.

850
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:53,555
And then we stuck to it.

851
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:54,924
Because we saw that
it worked really well.

852
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,359
- Well, yeah,

853
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,928
I just allowed Samuel to
guide the whole thing.

854
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,596
I sat there and I
would just back him up.

855
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:01,864
I'm wearing a lab coat as well.

856
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:04,600
So I go, uh, oh wow.

857
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:07,670
And it was almost hard
sometimes to not laugh

858
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:08,905
because he'd be like,

859
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,475
Ah, yes. Well, oh,
you feel sleepy?

860
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:14,343
Oh, that means
you're very advanced.

861
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:16,579
And I'd be like he
said about everything.

862
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,613
(laughing)

863
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:19,348
It was so funny!

864
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:20,450
And I was always excited
to see what level

865
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,585
he would say they reach
because it gave me a sense

866
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:24,787
of how much further you
wanted to go with them.

867
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:27,190
- Right, right.

868
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,659
And because as you remember,
we had many more kids

869
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,227
than we what ended
up showing on camera.

870
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:34,664
And we had great results
with all of them.

871
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:35,865
- Right, so let's
talk about that.

872
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:40,236
So you see three children
featured here in this episode.

873
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,939
But I believe there were
seven, eight or nine

874
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,574
that we actually worked with.

875
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,641
- There were 12,

876
00:35:45,642 --> 00:35:47,543
- there were 12, Okay,

877
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:49,512
not all 12 could fit

878
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:51,581
into the time constraints
in that episode.

879
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,617
That's partly why I
wanna have this marathon

880
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:55,618
so we can talk more.

881
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,220
- You remember Mikey?

882
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,588
Really, really hyper,

883
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,856
really difficult to
get him in the machine.

884
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,625
And still, there were lots and
lots of improvements at home,

885
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,460
he was able to take a
shower for the first time

886
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:06,462
he made a friend at camp.

887
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:09,398
And the watch in particular
worked really well with him

888
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:10,499
because he was
very focused on it.

889
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,003
And I made him work really
hard to earn that watch.

890
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,671
So by the time he got the watch,

891
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,473
he was already going in
the machine, he was calmer,

892
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:19,642
he was more
respectful to his dad.

893
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:23,479
- I think I remember
the parents,

894
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,650
the dad saying, okay, so we
reached a point where your goal

895
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:30,653
was to get the watch off the kid

896
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:33,889
that you don't need to watch,
after all, your own brain,

897
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:39,729
your own self can control this.

898
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,864
But people really want
those accessories.

899
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:43,332
And the parents were like,

900
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,034
Well, I mean, could you
tell them to keep it on?

901
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:46,602
Because it keeps the kid calm,

902
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:48,504
and it makes them
more thoughtful.

903
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,640
And it makes them more
aware of their behavior.

904
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,775
- You have kids, right?
- Mm-hmm.

905
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,343
- Do you use any of these
tactics on your own kids?

906
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:57,980
- Absolutely, our very first
subject was my son Mathias

907
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:00,049
who suffered from
chronic migraines.

908
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,451
And we did a lot of work on him.

909
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:06,789
And we had amazing results
on his chronic migraines,

910
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,557
Mathias, he couldn't make it

911
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:09,725
in the final cut of the episode.

912
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:13,729
But he also helped in the
initial study as a child mentor,

913
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,332
because we found that a lot
of the kids were terrified

914
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,566
of getting into the machine.

915
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:19,602
But then if they could
speak to another child

916
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:20,603
who had gone through
the procedure,

917
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:22,972
and who could talk about
how fun and safe it was

918
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,674
and how he'd gotten better,

919
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,909
then we were able to
have much better results.

920
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,378
So we use this kind of
peer mentoring strategy

921
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:32,715
that we're still using,
actually, in the studies

922
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:33,783
that we're running now.

923
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,651
But yeah, for sure, I use
these kinds of tricks.

924
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:40,623
And I give placebos to my
children, all the time.

925
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:43,559
- And then you have your kids
peddle the placebos to others,

926
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,661
because you're right, we
don't show Matia, Mathias?

927
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:46,862
- Mathias, yeah.

928
00:37:46,863 --> 00:37:49,732
- We don't show Mathias in
the episode, but he was there.

929
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,336
And man, the kids believed him
so much more than the adults.

930
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,072
If he said, Yeah, I get
in their like every day,

931
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,540
or whatever his schedule was,

932
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,741
he was honest about all of this,

933
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:01,644
and he was honest about the
good results he was getting.

934
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:03,446
Although let's be very clear,

935
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:07,483
this MRI is just a piece of
plastic, it is not plugged in.

936
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,685
It does not have
the liquid helium

937
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:13,556
in their magnets in
anything, it's just plastic.

938
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,525
- And Mathias at the time he
participated in this study,

939
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:18,661
was still blind
to the condition,

940
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:20,896
meaning that he was
still somewhat convinced

941
00:38:20,897 --> 00:38:23,666
that there was
something to the machine

942
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,701
even though he
understood the language,

943
00:38:25,702 --> 00:38:27,136
he understood the
concept of suggestion,

944
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:28,504
but there's a part of him

945
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:30,673
that didn't wanna
think about that fully.

946
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:33,409
- How can this only
be a suggestion if
I'm in the basement

947
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,644
of a neuroscience lab
with this big machine?

948
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:38,647
Clearly, they're lying
when they tell me the truth

949
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:40,416
that this is a placebo.

950
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,917
All right, let's get back
into it, you guys ready?

951
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,386
Here we go.

952
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,621
In six weeks, we would
return to the lab

953
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:48,724
to check in on their progress.

954
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:54,764
(upbeat music)

955
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,966
This high tech
contraption is pretty much

956
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,167
what McGill university's

957
00:38:58,168 --> 00:39:00,603
first Sham brain
scanner looked like.

958
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,038
It was an old
discarded hair dryer.

959
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:05,007
But the patients
didn't know that.

960
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:08,444
In the original study, 56
undergraduate students were told

961
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:10,980
that it was able to reduce
pain, cause amnesia,

962
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,982
influence sexual attraction

963
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,684
and produce various
other impressive effects.

964
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:18,621
The labs new, more
modern sham brain scanner

965
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,991
shows even more promise, and
I was invited to participate

966
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:26,562
in its test on a whole new
group of adult subjects.

967
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:29,598
(soft music)

968
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,635
- Okay, so you can come in
here and just grab a seat.

969
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,703
- [Michael] These college
students are fully aware

970
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,606
of what's possible
today with neuroscience.

971
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:40,042
Could even they be
neuro and chanted enough

972
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,111
to believe in the impossible,

973
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:45,581
that an MRI scanner could
read their thoughts.

974
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:47,983
Now, we're looking at cutting
edge psychological research.

975
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,652
- Okay.
- Yes.

976
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,720
It's part of the neural
activation mapping project.

977
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:52,721
We're gonna be
putting you in an MRI.

978
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:55,724
So it's a modified one,
it's called a CTMS FMRI.

979
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:57,193
- Okay.

980
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,594
- So Combined Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation,

981
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:01,630
Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging,

982
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:02,565
which is a big word just meaning

983
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,166
it can both read and
influence thoughts.

984
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,601
- All right, okay.

985
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:07,837
- So you'll be choosing
a number from 10 to 99.

986
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,505
- Okay.

987
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:11,974
- And then from looking at your
neural activation patterns,

988
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,576
Dr. Veissière here
will try to infer

989
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,743
which number you're thinking.

990
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:16,645
- Interesting, okay.
- Okay, great.

991
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:18,481
- [Michael] Most
adults know the basics

992
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:22,685
about MRIs, so we made
sure to cover every detail.

993
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,187
- In the scanner, the
magnetism is a lot less.

994
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:26,755
this is good for the
documentary team,

995
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:27,923
because it means they
can bring cameras,

996
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:30,860
so that said, we do have to
remove the metal gadgets.

997
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,094
- Got it, all these.

998
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:33,028
- [Michael] After
this realistic,

999
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:35,598
but completely unnecessary step,

1000
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,169
it was time to begin our
fake mind reading experiment.

1001
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,572
(eerie sound)

1002
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:45,107
- So we're gonna
start the calibration,

1003
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:46,876
so try to stay very still.

1004
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,077
- [Michael] Of course,

1005
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,578
there was actually
nothing to calibrate,

1006
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:51,780
but we were conditioning
our subjects

1007
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:53,549
with the expected procedures,

1008
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,653
sights and sounds
of a real MRI study.

1009
00:40:57,654 --> 00:40:59,588
(beeping sound)

1010
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,056
Okay, think of the number one.

1011
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:02,525
- [Michael] The
subjects were asked

1012
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,694
to concentrate on the
numbers zero to nine,

1013
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:09,198
while the machine supposedly
mapped parts of their brains.

1014
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,933
- Think of the number nine.

1015
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,067
- [Michael] Dr. Veissière and I

1016
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:14,537
remained in character
at all times,

1017
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,239
pretending to analyze the
subjects brain activity,

1018
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,942
but the images on our
screens were actually

1019
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:22,711
old MRI scans from
former patients

1020
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:24,013
- [Jay] Is the calibration good?

1021
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,748
- It looks pretty good to me.

1022
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,784
- With our subject now primed,
it was time to convince her

1023
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,553
that the scanner could
identify a number

1024
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,722
she was thinking of,
by reading her mind,

1025
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,591
- You're gonna choose
a number from 10 to 99.

1026
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:37,059
- Okay.

1027
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,561
- You're gonna hear a beep,
then you'll hear a second beep.

1028
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,728
So you're always
making your decision

1029
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:40,663
between the two beeps.

1030
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,630
- Okay.

1031
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:42,631
- Good?
- Got it.

1032
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:43,666
- So I'll slide you in.

1033
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,235
(soft music)

1034
00:41:46,236 --> 00:41:53,576
(beep)

1035
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,177
So hold on to that
number for just a second.

1036
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:56,712
- Okay.

1037
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:57,846
- They're gonna print it
out, and then we'll see.

1038
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:59,815
- Okay.

1039
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:01,283
- It was pretty clear.

1040
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:03,285
- [Michael] we pretended
to give Jay the results

1041
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:06,021
of the MRIs analysis,
but actually,

1042
00:42:06,022 --> 00:42:09,325
Jay was about to add the
subjects number to the document

1043
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,760
with a little sleight of hand.

1044
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,362
- Okay, so you can say lying
down just for a second.

1045
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:14,663
What was the number?

1046
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:15,598
- 31.

1047
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,699
- 31, okay, cool.

1048
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,033
So if you can set up here.

1049
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:19,001
- What?

1050
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:20,235
(laughing)

1051
00:42:20,236 --> 00:42:22,171
- So it's pretty close,
but it's swapped, uh.

1052
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,740
- Yeah, okay.

1053
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:27,009
- [Michael] That miss
was actually intentional.

1054
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,612
So the results didn't
appear to be perfect.

1055
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,813
Adding to the realism.

1056
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,248
- So you're doing well, we'll
do another trial of this.

1057
00:42:33,249 --> 00:42:36,652
The same thing, okay,
I'll slide you in.

1058
00:42:36,653 --> 00:42:38,787
(upbeat music)

1059
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:40,889
- [Michael] Michelle
thought of a new number

1060
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,726
will the scanner get
it right this time?

1061
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,827
- Super clear.

1062
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,029
- It's clear.
- Really good this time.

1063
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,964
- [Jay] All right, they
think the signal is clear.

1064
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:50,666
What was your number?

1065
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:51,800
- 27

1066
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:53,636
- Uh, 27 did you say?

1067
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:54,870
- 27.

1068
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,772
- Okay, great, yeah so
if you can set up here.

1069
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:57,806
- Yes, oh, wow.

1070
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:58,874
What?

1071
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:02,144
I don't understand, crazy.

1072
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:04,413
- So you chose 27?
- I did.

1073
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:06,649
- And technician got 27 as well.

1074
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,250
- Yeah, well okay.
- Yeah.

1075
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:09,852
(Mitchell laughing)

1076
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:13,756
- Oh, wow, how does that feel?

1077
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,159
- I didn't expect it
to be so specific.

1078
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,794
A lot of different areas in
the brain could be lighting up

1079
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:20,929
Just think of the
concept of a number.

1080
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,931
- [Michael] What do
you know, it worked,

1081
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:25,934
thanks to the wonders
of science, or rather,

1082
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:27,269
the skills of Jay,

1083
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,072
who in addition to
being a neuroscientist,

1084
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:34,309
happens to be a professional
magician on the side.

1085
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,679
Well, Jay won't reveal
the secret of the trick.

1086
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,914
The mind reading
illusion is very similar

1087
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:40,315
to The Mentalist tricks

1088
00:43:40,316 --> 00:43:43,318
that have entertained
audiences for over a century.

1089
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,688
The only difference
is that when audiences

1090
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,190
see the stunt performed
in a magic setting,

1091
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:51,460
they think it's a great
trick, not real science.

1092
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:52,795
- The machine had 89.

1093
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,830
(laughing)

1094
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:56,065
- That's cool.

1095
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,332
- [Michael] However,
in the impressive

1096
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,401
scientific setting
of the Raz Lab,

1097
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:02,871
these subjects thought our
magic trick was real science.

1098
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:04,707
- Oh my god (laughing)

1099
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,941
- [Michael] They didn't realize

1100
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,444
that the real science
they were experiencing.

1101
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:09,379
- It's pretty cool.

1102
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,814
- [Michael] Was the
power of suggestion.

1103
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,215
- Wow.

1104
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:16,151
- A dose of neuro
enchantment this powerful

1105
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:20,189
can make for a formidable
and effective placebo.

1106
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,324
I want some of the
physical sensations.

1107
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:23,258
- Sure.

1108
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:24,426
- What was your experience?

1109
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:25,461
- I felt like the
headache was coming on,

1110
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:29,064
I sort of felt like
tingling through my head--

1111
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:29,998
- Where?

1112
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:31,266
- Just through this area.

1113
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,769
Like this whole area
felt more like full

1114
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,040
- I felt like a sort of
pressure or something like that,

1115
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:39,875
a strange feeling.

1116
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:41,310
- Back here a little bit.

1117
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,311
- [Michael] In the back?

1118
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:43,512
- Yeah, a little
bit in the back.

1119
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:46,014
- Somewhere in the back of
the head, right, interesting.

1120
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:47,850
- Some tingling inside my head.

1121
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,384
- Okay.

1122
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:52,821
- I wanna hear what it felt
like to have your mind read.

1123
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:54,323
- That was very strange.

1124
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:57,192
I think I was probably
skeptical, like going into it.

1125
00:44:57,193 --> 00:45:00,929
And then I couldn't figure out
as I was thinking like, why,

1126
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,131
how that would happen otherwise.

1127
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,767
And so I'm just I think
in a baffled state.

1128
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,400
(laughing)

1129
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:06,368
- Yeah, yeah.

1130
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:09,304
It was time to clear up
this baffling mystery.

1131
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:13,142
So some deception has
been going on today.

1132
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:17,312
Dr. Olson is not reading your
mind, neither is this machine.

1133
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:19,214
This machine is deactivated.

1134
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:21,817
All the noises were
coming from a speaker.

1135
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:23,485
- It was an
illusion, oh, my God!

1136
00:45:23,486 --> 00:45:26,321
(laughing)

1137
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:27,790
That's pretty cool.

1138
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,826
- Dr. Olson is not
reading your mind.

1139
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,027
- Oh, no!

1140
00:45:32,028 --> 00:45:33,896
- The sounds you're
hearing are not magnets.

1141
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,364
It's just from a speaker.

1142
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,800
The machine in there is
actually deactivated,

1143
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:38,934
it's not working.

1144
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:40,836
- Well, it's like placebo.

1145
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:42,471
- Yeah, that's
exactly what it is.

1146
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:45,107
Now imagine tapping into
this power for other effects,

1147
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:46,575
like healing, for example.

1148
00:45:46,576 --> 00:45:48,677
- Right, wow!

1149
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:50,445
- I'm definitely believe
the placebo effect

1150
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:51,480
is alive and well.

1151
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:52,915
(laughing)

1152
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,450
- All right, so
we just saw adults

1153
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:59,588
being fooled and
certainly lied to.

1154
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:05,828
However, the cool thing is that,
while we punked the adults,

1155
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,064
we used that same phenomenon
for good with the children.

1156
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:11,500
And we don't deceive
the children,

1157
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:16,471
we just allow them to
deceive themselves.

1158
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:19,975
I still don't know how
the magic trick is done.

1159
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:21,577
And I never asked
because it's his trick,

1160
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,478
not mine to know.

1161
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:26,448
But when the participants
said the number

1162
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,550
they were thinking of he managed
to somehow get it written

1163
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:30,552
on that sheet and the time
it took him to be like,

1164
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:33,856
yep, that's what it said,
and it was phenomenal.

1165
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,424
And then to hear people say,

1166
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:38,327
Oh, yeah, no, I felt
tingling, my head felt full.

1167
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,629
It's like you were
just laying on a bed.

1168
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,497
Nothing was on,
nothing was happening.

1169
00:46:42,498 --> 00:46:44,600
It's all in your imagination.

1170
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,368
- Well, a little
behind the scenes here,

1171
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:47,603
you might remember
that there was

1172
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,504
a second condition
to that experiment,

1173
00:46:49,505 --> 00:46:53,141
where we implanted
numbers in people's heads.

1174
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:54,910
So once we get them to believe

1175
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,445
that the machine
reads their mind.

1176
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:57,413
So their minds are blown.

1177
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,148
And then we inserted
numbers in their head.

1178
00:47:00,149 --> 00:47:02,951
So one of the guys you
might remember, say,

1179
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:05,554
I thought of the number
45 I hate the number 45.

1180
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:07,956
I would never myself,
pick that number,

1181
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:09,958
the number was just
flying into my face.

1182
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:11,627
And so it's in that
second condition

1183
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,529
that a lot of them reported,

1184
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,965
kind of weird feelings like
tingling and headaches.

1185
00:47:16,966 --> 00:47:19,001
- That's right,
I totally forgot.

1186
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,636
It didn't even make
it into the episode.

1187
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,338
But we also said now that
we can read your mind,

1188
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:27,609
we are going to implant
thoughts into your mind,

1189
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,145
you are going to have a
number put into your head,

1190
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:31,413
you'll close your eyes

1191
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:33,582
and a number will appear
that we have put there.

1192
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:36,285
And of course, we use the
same sleight of hand trick

1193
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,486
to convince them that
that's what happened,

1194
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,489
whatever they thought they had.

1195
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,225
Whatever they had thought was
what we wanted them to think.

1196
00:47:43,226 --> 00:47:44,559
And,

1197
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,528
obviously, that's crazy,

1198
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:50,098
like that could
be abused so much.

1199
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:54,236
But yet we convinced
neuro science postdocs

1200
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,238
that we were able to do it.

1201
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:57,973
- And you might remember
we were toying around

1202
00:47:57,974 --> 00:48:00,342
with doing like just
improvising a third condition

1203
00:48:00,343 --> 00:48:02,577
where we make people
speak or like say things

1204
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:04,579
or we induce the
symptoms of Tourette's.

1205
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:08,617
And in retrospect, if we had
done that saying the behavior

1206
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:11,186
in the reverse exorcism
episode, remember,

1207
00:48:11,187 --> 00:48:14,256
like, we were able to induce
all kinds of weird feelings,

1208
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:15,991
like even an out
of body experience,

1209
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:18,293
but we couldn't really
get people to speak.

1210
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:21,263
We couldn't get the spirit
to speak through their mouth.

1211
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:22,597
But if you'd have taken them

1212
00:48:22,598 --> 00:48:23,732
through like two
steps like this,

1213
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:25,167
to really convince them

1214
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,501
that this machine
is doing something,

1215
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:28,236
then we could have
gotten participants

1216
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:30,138
to do all kinds of wild things.

1217
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,673
- Yeah, that we branded at time,

1218
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:33,308
but I remember that
day, you were like,

1219
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:35,310
let's just go out on the street,
recruit people to come in.

1220
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:36,745
I can get them to say bad words.

1221
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:38,347
And think that it's being,

1222
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,016
like they're a puppet
of the machine.

1223
00:48:41,017 --> 00:48:42,584
- Is that related to hypnosis?

1224
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:44,519
- Yeah, sure, absolutely.

1225
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,191
It is hypnosis, it's accessory,
ritual assisted hypnosis.

1226
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,527
- I think that
hypnotism is often seen,

1227
00:48:52,528 --> 00:48:54,162
well, at least I
can speak for myself

1228
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:56,531
as a nothing but a trick, right?

1229
00:48:56,532 --> 00:48:59,668
I know that there are cases
where it's used clinically.

1230
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:01,570
Is it all placebo, though?

1231
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,705
I mean, what are
you really doing

1232
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:05,140
when you hypnotize someone?

1233
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:06,608
And they need to be
susceptible to it.

1234
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:07,876
- Have you ever been hypnotized?

1235
00:49:07,877 --> 00:49:11,546
- No, I think I could respond
to being hypnotized like this.

1236
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:13,382
Because while I don't
have a lot of faith

1237
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:17,586
in whoa, Hocus Pocus, hypnotizy,

1238
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,088
instead, I will be
like, this is an MRI,

1239
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:22,190
you're wearing a lab coat,

1240
00:49:22,191 --> 00:49:24,559
whatever is gonna
happen is gonna happen.

1241
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,595
- Yeah, so is
hypnosis like placebo

1242
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,797
that depends what
you mean by placebo?

1243
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:32,567
But if what you're
asking is, is hypnosis,

1244
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:36,605
tapping into some, say,
autonomic resources

1245
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,873
that we typically

1246
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,675
don't have access to
volitionally effort
fully, then yes.

1247
00:49:40,676 --> 00:49:44,546
So getting people to somehow
relax their hyper vigilance

1248
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:47,282
and being being able to tap into

1249
00:49:47,283 --> 00:49:48,817
or elicits
physiological responses

1250
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:51,420
that they themselves could
not induce voluntarily.

1251
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:52,354
Yes.

1252
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:55,257
And I think you're correct.

1253
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:56,458
The induction ritual

1254
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,527
of surrendering to
the set of suggestions

1255
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,362
about falling into trance,

1256
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:01,597
that's the kind of a
cultural bound ritual

1257
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,667
that works for some people,
that may not work for others.

1258
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:10,305
But I think that anyone
can be hypnotized,

1259
00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:11,673
as long as you
find the right set

1260
00:50:11,674 --> 00:50:13,508
of what we would
call epistemic cues.

1261
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:16,111
So you tap into the
kind of knowledge,

1262
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:18,180
the kinds of things that
they're likely to believe in

1263
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,682
as being authoritative, then
you can definitely get people

1264
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:23,518
to relax their
critical thinking.

1265
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,154
- So, I'll say I've actually
been hypnotized before.

1266
00:50:26,155 --> 00:50:28,523
And I was very, very
skeptical going in.

1267
00:50:28,524 --> 00:50:31,159
And as the hypnotist
was telling me,

1268
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,394
oh, when you open your eyes,

1269
00:50:32,395 --> 00:50:33,662
you're gonna forget
the number three.

1270
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,163
I remember thinking
to myself consciously,

1271
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:37,699
there's no way I'm
gonna fall for this.

1272
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,168
And then he say,
Okay, now count to 10.

1273
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:43,472
And then I would get to
three, and then I would pause,

1274
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,607
even though I'm telling
myself, in my head, I'm saying,

1275
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:48,543
I can see the number three,
but I just couldn't get it out.

1276
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:52,781
- Wow, I need to do this,
I need to get hypnotized,

1277
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:54,883
because I've always seen
it as just a party trick

1278
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:57,552
where I'm gonna make you
bark like a dog on stage

1279
00:50:57,553 --> 00:50:59,254
for at a kid's birthday party.

1280
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:00,755
And they do, and I'm like
they're all faking it.

1281
00:51:00,756 --> 00:51:02,390
- But you may not
be susceptible.

1282
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:06,328
So there's a pretty Gaussian
distribution of susceptibility.

1283
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:09,698
So most people will fall for
some things, but not all.

1284
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,333
Some people will
fall for nothing.

1285
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,135
- Some fall for all
- Exactly.

1286
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,137
- So it's interesting
because it is a relatively

1287
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:19,608
stable psychological trade,
and that's well studied.

1288
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,243
It doesn't change much
throughout the lifetime

1289
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,444
except in childhood.

1290
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:23,812
So between the ages
of seven and 14

1291
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:26,248
is when people are
more hypnotizable.

1292
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,217
And some people are so we
say their highs or lows,

1293
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:31,253
high hypnotizables,
low hypnotizables,

1294
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,589
and there is a
normal distribution.

1295
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:35,824
- But it's really weird.

1296
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:37,526
Actually, I don't know
if I'd recommend it.

1297
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,361
It was a kind of an unpleasant
experience to be hypnotized.

1298
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,729
- I've done more
unpleasant things.

1299
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,632
I think, I wanna talk about
that after this episode,

1300
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,168
kind of talk through some
of the more uncomfortable

1301
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,270
and scary moments, but for now,

1302
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,638
let's just get right
back into the episode.

1303
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,506
All right, here we go.

1304
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:56,478
(soft music)

1305
00:51:56,479 --> 00:51:58,680
There's evidence that
the power of suggestion

1306
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:01,349
even works on animals.

1307
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,285
A study at North
Carolina State University

1308
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:07,756
found that 86% of dogs receiving
real seizure medication

1309
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,658
had a reduction in seizures,

1310
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:13,261
but almost as many a full 79%

1311
00:52:13,262 --> 00:52:16,631
experienced the same effect
from just a placebo pill.

1312
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:20,335
Now, we don't know how a
placebo effects a dog's brain.

1313
00:52:20,336 --> 00:52:21,970
But it could be that
dogs have learned

1314
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:25,507
to associate vet visits
and medicine from humans

1315
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:26,641
with feeling better.

1316
00:52:26,642 --> 00:52:28,376
So giving them a placebo

1317
00:52:28,377 --> 00:52:31,346
could help a dog's
brain heal itself.

1318
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:32,814
(upbeat music)

1319
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:35,817
Quick note, we

1320
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:38,987
recorded the scene with
that dog so many times.

1321
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:40,889
There were so many takes,
were you there, Dan?

1322
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:41,723
- I was there.

1323
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:42,991
- Oh, man, first of all,

1324
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:44,659
I don't think a lot of
people don't know this.

1325
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,528
But all those rooftop scenes

1326
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:48,964
from season one and
two were shot at night.

1327
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,299
We did a whole week
of overnight shoots

1328
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,736
from 5:00 in the evening
to 5:00 in the morning.

1329
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:57,606
And so I don't know what
time of night that was.

1330
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:58,607
But we're all exhausted.
- It's like 3:00

1331
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,842
in the morning, the dog
would climb up to you--

1332
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:02,677
- The dog would jump on me yeah.

1333
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:04,379
it was hard to get
the dog to wait.

1334
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,647
And the trainer was like, look,

1335
00:53:05,648 --> 00:53:07,649
the dog doesn't
understand its cue.

1336
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,718
It just knows that you're
gonna give him cheese.

1337
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,653
It doesn't know
what you're saying,

1338
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,687
And he doesn't know
when it's a good moment.

1339
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:15,657
The dog was not a great actor.

1340
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:17,259
Shall we continue?

1341
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,728
Here we go.

1342
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,831
- So first, I'll ask
you to lay down again.

1343
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,300
And of course, you're
a total pro at this.

1344
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,468
- [Michael] For several weeks,

1345
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,903
the children had undergone
sessions in the Sham scanner

1346
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:30,805
at McGill University.

1347
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:33,441
- Your body continues to relax

1348
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:36,544
as we keep unleashing
this healing energy.

1349
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:38,013
- [Michael] Each time
they were reminded

1350
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,649
that through concentration
and relaxation,

1351
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,551
they were helping
heal their own brains.

1352
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:44,752
- There we go.

1353
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:48,723
Finally, after six weeks of
receiving the placebo sessions,

1354
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:52,360
it was time to get a
report on the results.

1355
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:53,962
Malaya suffered from anxiety

1356
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:56,698
and a compulsive skin
picking disorder.

1357
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:00,068
Had she experienced
any level of success?

1358
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:01,936
It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1359
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:04,572
- Go ahead and take a
seat, you're wearing

1360
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:06,675
not even, I thought maybe
they'd have short sleeves on

1361
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,044
you've just got a tank top on.

1362
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,578
Your arms look fantastic.

1363
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:12,580
They've really gotten better.

1364
00:54:12,581 --> 00:54:14,649
And your face I mean, all of it.

1365
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,651
Why do you think you're better?

1366
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:18,653
- I'm guessing it's the machine.

1367
00:54:18,654 --> 00:54:19,888
- [Michael] Yeah, what about it?

1368
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,557
- Ah, I'm not really
sure how it works.

1369
00:54:22,558 --> 00:54:24,592
But I'm picking a lot less,

1370
00:54:24,593 --> 00:54:27,629
sometimes if I see
like a tiny flake,

1371
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,631
I'll just leave it there.

1372
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:32,434
- That's a pretty short amount
of time for such a big change

1373
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:35,637
in the way you think and
behave, that's awesome.

1374
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:37,672
- I don't really feel
the urge to do it

1375
00:54:37,673 --> 00:54:41,676
as much as I did before, so
it's a big improvement I guess.

1376
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:43,511
- Yeah, that
definitely feels like

1377
00:54:43,512 --> 00:54:45,947
and sounds like your
brain being powerful.

1378
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:47,816
- It's obviously
doing something,

1379
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,884
because my arms are better.

1380
00:54:49,885 --> 00:54:51,619
- Well, you seem a
lot more confident

1381
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,122
holding your head up higher,
would you agree Anne Marie?

1382
00:54:54,123 --> 00:54:57,892
- Yes, she seems less anxious.

1383
00:54:57,893 --> 00:55:01,396
She's more positive, (mumbles)
I was hoping for this.

1384
00:55:01,397 --> 00:55:03,365
It's more than nice to see her.

1385
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,534
- Yeah, good work.

1386
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:10,572
And ask for Nicholas and
his migraine headaches.

1387
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,475
Hey, it's good to see
you again, Nicholas.

1388
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,944
Tell me about the procedure
and how you felt afterwards,

1389
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,613
- It accomplished things
that I wanted it to.

1390
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,949
I haven't had a migraine at all.

1391
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,650
- [Michael] That's awesome.

1392
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:24,619
- And concentration is a
big thing that it helped.

1393
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,854
- Wow!

1394
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:26,755
And can I see the
symptom charts?

1395
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,689
- For sure.

1396
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,990
- So these go back to February.

1397
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:30,658
- Yeah, and they're
really telling.

1398
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:33,695
- And you can see not
good, lots going on.

1399
00:55:33,696 --> 00:55:36,798
But then recently,
no migraines at all.

1400
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,433
That's incredible.

1401
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:39,667
- Yeah.

1402
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:41,169
- So you said you went
to the neurologist.

1403
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,804
- They thought it
was quite remarkable.

1404
00:55:42,805 --> 00:55:45,573
He hasn't needed any
rescue medication

1405
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:47,108
and he hasn't needed
the preventer.

1406
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:49,411
And he's not having migraines.

1407
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:53,114
- I'm actually really
excited for high school.

1408
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:54,616
- [Michael] Both
Malaya and Nicholas

1409
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,485
attribute their improvements
to the Sham scanner.

1410
00:55:57,486 --> 00:56:01,689
They believed it was working
for them, and indeed it did.

1411
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,958
So how did Nathan who
suffered from ADHD

1412
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:07,829
and impulse control disorder
fair over the last six weeks?

1413
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,131
Well I received a home
video from Nathan's mother,

1414
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:13,668
with an update on his progress?

1415
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:16,070
- So the best part about
going through the treatment

1416
00:56:16,071 --> 00:56:20,208
was just what it did to our
son, we noticed a difference

1417
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:22,744
in Nathan immediately
after the first session,

1418
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:23,978
and do you remember
what happened?

1419
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:25,113
- I slept?

1420
00:56:25,114 --> 00:56:28,450
- Yeah, he slept
something he doesn't do

1421
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,753
very often during the day,
he slept for two hours.

1422
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:34,055
He was refreshed, it was
just incredible to see it.

1423
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:36,958
And then what happened
was the entire summer

1424
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:39,894
we had him off the
medicine, and he did great.

1425
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:42,464
He thought about stuff
before he did it,

1426
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:46,734
we were able to talk things
out and it's been fun.

1427
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:48,703
So overall, we're very pleased.

1428
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:51,639
And we just had such
a great experience,

1429
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,175
so thank you very much.

1430
00:56:54,176 --> 00:56:56,611
- [Michael] The Children's
results are encouraging,

1431
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:59,681
and a powerful sign of
how effective suggestions

1432
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,617
and our willingness
believe them can be.

1433
00:57:02,618 --> 00:57:04,586
In time, the kids
will understand

1434
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,955
how all of the power
was within them,

1435
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,924
and not in the scanner.

1436
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:13,595
This work is truly cutting edge
it hasn't been done before.

1437
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,796
- Correct.

1438
00:57:14,797 --> 00:57:17,499
We also think of this
as a great new way

1439
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,067
to do science and
to collaborate.

1440
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:21,769
- So much more of the public
will see what's being done.

1441
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,605
- Yes, science isn't
just about publishing

1442
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,806
a paper that nobody reads.

1443
00:57:24,807 --> 00:57:26,674
It's about spreading
the ideas that you find.

1444
00:57:26,675 --> 00:57:28,209
- 100%.

1445
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,911
- As far as I'm concerned,
you're already a co author

1446
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:32,013
in our scientific
experimental paper.

1447
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:33,715
- Wow, very cool.

1448
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:34,582
Thank you.

1449
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:41,022
(upbeat music)

1450
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:42,624
- [Michael] The
Children's improvements

1451
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,026
were caused by the
placebo effect.

1452
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:48,129
And no deception was
used to mask that.

1453
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,798
The parents knew the
machine was deactivated.

1454
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,668
And the children were only
told that it had the power

1455
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:56,170
to put a suggestion
in their brain,

1456
00:57:56,171 --> 00:58:00,208
a suggestion that ultimately
came from themselves.

1457
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:03,111
But surely, the more
people learn about placebos

1458
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,647
and their lack of
intrinsic power,

1459
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,716
the less effective
they'll be, right?

1460
00:58:08,717 --> 00:58:11,819
No, studies show that
even when subjects learned

1461
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,788
that their treatment
was a placebo,

1462
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:17,625
the positive results
do not go away.

1463
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:20,261
What the subjects have learned
about how to heal themselves,

1464
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:22,797
remains with them.

1465
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:24,866
It was an honor to have
been a part of this study.

1466
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:27,769
I think this is Mind
Field at its best.

1467
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,838
Using our resources to help
researchers with their work

1468
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:34,742
and helping the public see
how the brain is studied.

1469
00:58:34,743 --> 00:58:36,844
Placebos can't fix everything.

1470
00:58:36,845 --> 00:58:41,616
But these kids always had
the power to start healing.

1471
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:45,787
All they needed was the
power of suggestion.

1472
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:50,024
And as always,
thanks for watching.

1473
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:52,660
All right, so
that's the episode.

1474
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:56,230
Dr. Veissière I have
dismissed Elisabeth and Daniel

1475
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:59,701
so that we can talk
one on one, honestly.

1476
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,702
- I miss them.

1477
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,337
- Do you feel the pressure?

1478
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:07,609
What are your thoughts now
two years after that episode?

1479
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,777
- Well, my thoughts are we
are to take this further.

1480
00:59:09,778 --> 00:59:12,180
And so I'm thinking
lots of directions.

1481
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,681
One of them is practical.

1482
00:59:13,682 --> 00:59:15,617
It's kind of unfortunate
that the general public

1483
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,620
is really interested in this.

1484
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,255
But it's still hard to convince

1485
00:59:21,256 --> 00:59:24,325
the scientific community
and the clinical community,

1486
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:26,728
there's something
worth pursuing there

1487
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,162
because it's so weird.

1488
00:59:28,163 --> 00:59:30,398
So it's been difficult
to get research funding,

1489
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:32,834
it's been difficult to get
our research papers accepted

1490
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,737
for publication when
we try to present

1491
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,138
this particular project,

1492
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:39,907
- How do you do a
control in a study

1493
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:41,643
on the effectiveness of placebo?

1494
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:46,314
Like, do you test it
against a different placebo?

1495
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:48,149
- Yeah, and that's been one
of the comments from reviewers

1496
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,084
when we try to submit
this from publications.

1497
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:51,686
And I think it was a
really good comment

1498
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:52,587
they're asking, okay,

1499
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:54,422
so it seems you're
doing this really cool,

1500
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:55,790
really amazing procedure,

1501
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:57,859
you're giving these
kids a lot of attention,

1502
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,761
a lot of positive reinforcement.

1503
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,863
But what exactly works?

1504
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,097
And what doesn't work?

1505
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,332
Is there anything
in that intervention

1506
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:07,335
that is absolutely
necessary or essential?

1507
01:00:07,336 --> 01:00:10,104
For example, do you
actually need the scanner?

1508
01:00:10,105 --> 01:00:12,140
Could you just go and, give kids

1509
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,442
lots of positive suggestions
about how they can use

1510
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:18,746
their hyperactivity to be
really focused and strong?

1511
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:20,148
Or could you do us just a watch,

1512
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:22,750
so I can tell you something
we're doing right now is,

1513
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:25,453
we're beginning to test
in a randomized trial,

1514
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:28,356
just the watch versus
just the machine

1515
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:29,957
to see if one of
them works better.

1516
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:35,463
- Huh, okay, that sounds
really nice and precise.

1517
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:36,531
- Precise or not?

1518
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,266
Because even then there's
so many other factors,

1519
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,934
as you know, so
say, the charisma,

1520
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:42,804
or the reassuring tone
of the experimenter.

1521
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,739
Like I'm sure you're interested

1522
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,007
in the replication
crisis in psychology.

1523
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:48,443
So one of the hypotheses
is also that well,

1524
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:52,313
it could be that some labs are
trying to replicate a study.

1525
01:00:52,314 --> 01:00:54,449
Well, the experimenters are
just not as charismatic,

1526
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,818
there's just not as good
or not as authoritative.

1527
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,786
And there's lots of other
factors that are going on.

1528
01:00:58,787 --> 01:01:01,723
And it's not just a mechanism
itself that doesn't work

1529
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,258
is that this one team is
not able to reproduce it.

1530
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:07,061
- Man, it's so hard to control
for all of those things,

1531
01:01:07,062 --> 01:01:08,763
a bunch of different
people need to run this,

1532
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:11,999
but they all have to have
the exact same charisma.

1533
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,835
And every day, no matter
what their mood is

1534
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,436
different from day
to day, it can't be.

1535
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:19,307
Because we really only wanna
look at watch versus machine,

1536
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:23,745
when we know that the charisma
can play such a big role.

1537
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,980
- Mm hmm, or also, the
setting of the study,

1538
01:01:25,981 --> 01:01:26,981
is it in the hospital?

1539
01:01:26,982 --> 01:01:28,149
Or is it like right now

1540
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:29,851
we're gonna replicate
it in a school.

1541
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,352
Because it turned out
that logistically,

1542
01:01:31,353 --> 01:01:32,620
now that Mind Field is not there

1543
01:01:32,621 --> 01:01:35,890
to handle recruitment for us,
then we just could not manage

1544
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:38,126
to bring all the
participants in the hospital.

1545
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,894
And we have a contingent
from the school.

1546
01:01:39,895 --> 01:01:41,462
So it's a lot easier
to do it there.

1547
01:01:41,463 --> 01:01:44,532
And as such, we also have to
use a simpler mock scanner.

1548
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:46,334
- Right, you know what
that brings brings up

1549
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,836
a big limitation of how
Mind Field can help.

1550
01:01:48,837 --> 01:01:49,771
Because if you said okay,

1551
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,774
I've got a different
experimental design

1552
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:55,309
that I think is gonna
work really well.

1553
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,011
But it's very similar.

1554
01:01:57,012 --> 01:01:58,246
Could you do another episode

1555
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,281
that will look almost
exactly the same?

1556
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:01,349
I would love to,

1557
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,519
but I don't know if
YouTube would pay for that.

1558
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,054
So I hope that Mind Field

1559
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:10,491
can at least bring
what's being done,

1560
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:12,360
and its importance
to the public,

1561
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:17,064
so that they know what to
support and they know what to,

1562
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:19,500
I don't know what kind of
good things are being done

1563
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:23,237
and why it's important for us
to have research institutions

1564
01:02:23,238 --> 01:02:27,441
that are investigating things
that might seem I don't know,

1565
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:29,243
a little still fuzzy,

1566
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:31,879
but yet can lead to
amazing discoveries.

1567
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,248
What are you working on
that I don't know about

1568
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:35,850
that might be interesting.

1569
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:38,820
for future episodes of
Mind Field of Vsauce,

1570
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,589
I know that you were
working with tulpamancers.

1571
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:42,557
That's still going on?

1572
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:45,893
And if so explain what that is.

1573
01:02:45,894 --> 01:02:47,595
- Sure, so before talking
about tulpamancers,

1574
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:49,564
we're also doing
lots of stuff related

1575
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:50,765
to suggestion and
placebo studies.

1576
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:55,536
So we're testing like, say fake
Adderall, fake psychedelics.

1577
01:02:55,537 --> 01:02:57,171
- [Michael] Fake psychedelics.

1578
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:58,372
- Fake psychedelics--

1579
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:00,241
- There's an episode in the
first season of Mind Field,

1580
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:02,610
where we give people a short
acting and psychedelic,

1581
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:04,846
and we have
Confederates in the room

1582
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,280
that pretend like, Whoa!

1583
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:07,548
Everything's echoing.

1584
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:09,851
And sure enough, you can make
people think they're tripping.

1585
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,485
- Absolutely, and we
also use Confederates,

1586
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:13,888
just like you guys, and we
had really good results.

1587
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:16,490
- So what are you
specifically like,

1588
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:20,094
what variables are you kind
of tweaking and studying?

1589
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:22,163
- Well, we're also interested
in the whole battery

1590
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:24,465
of non specific
psychosocial effects

1591
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:27,501
beyond the chemical properties
of the substance themselves,

1592
01:03:27,502 --> 01:03:29,871
including the particular
cultural expectations

1593
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,539
that this psychedelic experience

1594
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,442
should yield this
particular effect.

1595
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:38,880
So we're looking at, social
proof, social conformity,

1596
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,581
emotional contagion, but also,

1597
01:03:40,582 --> 01:03:43,451
testing particular
cultural beliefs.

1598
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:47,588
We're also going to be
testing, Sham genetic testing

1599
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:51,492
to see how convincing that
might be, and at some point,

1600
01:03:51,493 --> 01:03:56,430
one of your dream is to compare
that to Sham neuroscience,

1601
01:03:56,431 --> 01:04:00,201
so to see, different kinds
of neuro enchantment.

1602
01:04:00,202 --> 01:04:01,302
- What's the point?

1603
01:04:01,303 --> 01:04:04,572
Okay, so we learn that
people are neural enchanted,

1604
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:07,108
and they're, I don't
know DNA enchanted,

1605
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:11,913
what's the word for that, our
faith and genetic research?

1606
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,581
- We think they're really
big ethical implications,

1607
01:04:13,582 --> 01:04:16,017
particularly when we start
thinking about potential,

1608
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,654
nocebo effects and culturally
widespread nocebo effects.

1609
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:23,424
So, genetic testing also
generates a lot of anxiety.

1610
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:24,559
A lot of the times it's not done

1611
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,062
under proper clinical settings
and clinical guidance,

1612
01:04:28,063 --> 01:04:29,630
and people start
worrying immensely,

1613
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:31,532
because they have
a particular gene

1614
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:32,433
that is thought to correlate

1615
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:33,935
with a particular
condition like say,

1616
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,636
Alzheimer's, for example.

1617
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:39,473
And that can bring about all
kinds of negative experiences,

1618
01:04:39,474 --> 01:04:43,377
including sometimes perhaps
precipitating early onset

1619
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:47,715
of diseases that may not
otherwise have been triggered.

1620
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:50,584
So we think there's lots
of important implications,

1621
01:04:50,585 --> 01:04:53,054
particularly in
terms of, debunking,

1622
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,456
dangerous pseudo medical
and pseudo scientific idea.

1623
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:57,224
So if we're able to demonstrate

1624
01:04:57,225 --> 01:04:59,527
that there's a lot of authority,

1625
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,595
a lot of placebo nocebo
effects associated with,

1626
01:05:01,596 --> 01:05:04,298
say, genetic testing,
then we're better able

1627
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:07,702
to inform clinical practice,
for example, or policy--

1628
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:12,006
- And the public cannot be
quite so enchanted by it

1629
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:15,476
or perhaps misled,
needlessly panicked.

1630
01:05:15,477 --> 01:05:16,310
Wow, it's important stuff.

1631
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:17,678
- And so to answer
your questions,

1632
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:19,547
yes, we're still working
with tulpamancers.

1633
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:22,583
As you recall, I did a
cyber ethnography years ago,

1634
01:05:22,584 --> 01:05:24,418
with just delivered a
psychological testing

1635
01:05:24,419 --> 01:05:28,556
on these really cool,
weird young people

1636
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,624
who conjure imaginary friends

1637
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:33,561
that they come to
experience as basically

1638
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:40,001
as auditory visual
hallucinations, except
they're not crazy.

1639
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,602
And they report an increase
in well being in their life,

1640
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,504
even in social
adjustment as a result

1641
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:44,439
of having picked
up the practice.

1642
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,507
So people wanna say,
well, they're crazy,

1643
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:48,709
they're hearing voices, and we
think we're able to show that

1644
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,578
No, in fact, there's
lots of context

1645
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:54,682
in which you can hear voices
and be a very healthy person.

1646
01:05:54,683 --> 01:05:59,587
So now, under the leadership
of Dr. Mike Lifshitz,

1647
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:03,691
and Dr. Tanya Lerman
at Stanford University,

1648
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:05,659
we're in the process
of doing neuro imaging

1649
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,728
of tulpamancers and
comparing them also

1650
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:11,065
to evangelical Christians
who speak in tongues.

1651
01:06:11,066 --> 01:06:14,668
And so we're interested in
seeing what happens in the brain

1652
01:06:14,669 --> 01:06:18,072
when either spirit or tulpa

1653
01:06:18,073 --> 01:06:20,141
sort of takes over
and starts talking.

1654
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,144
And we're interested in the

1655
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,413
motor areas of
the brain as well.

1656
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:28,382
And we wanna see if something
different is going on.

1657
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:31,552
When say, an agency other than
itself a tulpa or a spirit

1658
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:32,520
is sort of in control.

1659
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:33,754
- Yeah, what does it
look like in the brain

1660
01:06:33,755 --> 01:06:39,727
when you aren't in control of
your thoughts and behavior?

1661
01:06:39,728 --> 01:06:41,495
If we can tease
out the difference,

1662
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:44,398
then are we literally finding
like that is your agency

1663
01:06:44,399 --> 01:06:46,834
that is your
consciousness, your will?

1664
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:49,670
And if it's gone, then you
feel like you're possessed.

1665
01:06:49,671 --> 01:06:52,239
Which, by the way, brings us to

1666
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,109
our reverse exorcism episode,

1667
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,445
which you guys
should all check out.

1668
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:58,546
Keep me up to date
on what you're doing,

1669
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:02,316
because I really wanna
help in any way that I can.

1670
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:05,519
And, communicate all the
cool work that you're doing.

1671
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,822
So Dr. Veissière thanks.
- It's always a pleasure,

1672
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,523
- Always a pleasure.
- Thanks for having me.

1673
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:13,594
- Now, we're gonna
turn to a darker topic.

1674
01:07:13,595 --> 01:07:15,696
My own death.

1675
01:07:15,697 --> 01:07:18,532
Should I die?

1676
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:20,501
Let's find out.

1677
01:07:20,502 --> 01:07:26,407
(eerie music)

1678
01:07:26,408 --> 01:07:27,641
Someday,

1679
01:07:27,642 --> 01:07:28,676
I

1680
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:31,145
will die.

1681
01:07:31,146 --> 01:07:32,680
But should I?

1682
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,348
If I was offered a longer life,

1683
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:36,350
I would take that in a second.

1684
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:40,254
But how long is too long?

1685
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:44,525
Is death something I
should deny forever?

1686
01:07:44,526 --> 01:07:47,795
Or is death and the role
it plays in the universe,

1687
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:52,533
something I am
better off accepting?

1688
01:07:52,534 --> 01:08:13,621
(upbeat music)

1689
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,689
I wanna start by looking
at a particular way

1690
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:20,693
death affects how we live
and treat one another.

1691
01:08:20,694 --> 01:08:23,864
Terror Management Theory
proposes that people

1692
01:08:23,865 --> 01:08:28,736
like you and me manage the
terror of death's inevitability

1693
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,672
by embracing cultural values.

1694
01:08:31,673 --> 01:08:35,675
That the more aware a person
is of their own mortality,

1695
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:37,878
the more vehemently they will
enforce their particular views

1696
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:40,246
of the world on to others.

1697
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:43,217
Created by social
psychologists Sheldon Solomon,

1698
01:08:43,218 --> 01:08:45,419
Jeff Greenberg,
and Tom Pyszczynski

1699
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,754
Terror Management Theory,

1700
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:51,659
or TMT suggests that often
we are afraid of change,

1701
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,827
because we're afraid of death.

1702
01:08:53,828 --> 01:08:56,630
Each one of us has a
worldview, a set of beliefs,

1703
01:08:56,631 --> 01:08:59,800
customs and norms we identify
with that can live on

1704
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:02,436
after our business
physical bodies die.

1705
01:09:02,437 --> 01:09:05,739
TMT suggests that rises in
nationalism and prejudice

1706
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:09,643
are correlated with rises in
the salience of mortality,

1707
01:09:09,644 --> 01:09:11,644
but is how present the
inevitability of death

1708
01:09:11,645 --> 01:09:13,614
is in people's minds.

1709
01:09:13,615 --> 01:09:15,849
This role that death
plays fascinates me

1710
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:18,986
and two have TMT
originators Jeff and Sheldon

1711
01:09:18,987 --> 01:09:21,388
have agreed to work
with me on a pilot study

1712
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:22,990
of Terror Management Theory

1713
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:26,227
and real life
reminders of death.

1714
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,461
(soft music)

1715
01:09:28,462 --> 01:09:30,531
What's your hypothesis today?

1716
01:09:30,532 --> 01:09:34,668
Well, I think we're gonna
hope for the participants

1717
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:38,606
who are reminded of their
mortality to be more punitive,

1718
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,674
and their assessments.

1719
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:42,643
- Let's see what happens.

1720
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:44,378
- Good morning.

1721
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:46,614
- [Michael] For our study, we
created a fake Research Center

1722
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:49,483
staffed by actors and
invited participants

1723
01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:51,785
to be a part of what they
were told was a focus group

1724
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:53,853
about the criminal
justice system.

1725
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:56,690
During the actual study,
each group will hear

1726
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:59,460
a list of several different
crimes that have been committed,

1727
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,829
and will then be asked
to propose a punishment

1728
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,931
for each offender
with a severity level

1729
01:10:03,932 --> 01:10:07,801
ranging from one to seven, with
one being the most lenient,

1730
01:10:07,802 --> 01:10:10,437
and seven being the most severe.

1731
01:10:10,438 --> 01:10:13,274
The control group will
simply enter the survey room

1732
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,476
and be asked to
answer the questions.

1733
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,512
The experimental group,
however, will first be exposed

1734
01:10:18,513 --> 01:10:20,681
to reminders of
their own mortality

1735
01:10:20,682 --> 01:10:23,584
with strategically placed
posters in the lobby.

1736
01:10:23,585 --> 01:10:25,586
Also, the questionnaires
they fill out

1737
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:29,356
will include questions
about their own death.

1738
01:10:29,357 --> 01:10:31,792
Decades of TMT research have
shown that when presented

1739
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:34,328
with violations of
common worldviews,

1740
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:36,664
those who are more aware
of their own deaths

1741
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,667
will recommend bigger
punishments for the
crimes presented.

1742
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,569
But will our real life
reminders of death,

1743
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,905
not just the survey
questions usually used

1744
01:10:44,906 --> 01:10:46,674
make a difference?

1745
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:50,311
Well, first, let's look at
the control participants.

1746
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:52,346
- Thank you so much
for being here.

1747
01:10:52,347 --> 01:10:53,714
Now, I cannot
emphasize this enough,

1748
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:55,783
there are no right
or wrong answers.

1749
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:59,053
This is just about your
gut level reactions.

1750
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:02,389
All right, let's begin.

1751
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:03,524
After raising
millions of dollars

1752
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:06,794
in grant money to fund
education for needy children,

1753
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:09,630
a fundraising manager
unhappy with this life

1754
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:10,531
fled with all the money

1755
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,966
and was arrested months
later in Tasmania

1756
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:15,703
where he was living
under a different name.

1757
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:19,006
So one, his punishment
three months in prison,

1758
01:11:19,007 --> 01:11:22,343
seven is most severe,
10 years in prison.

1759
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,610
Please answer now.

1760
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:27,781
(upbeat music)

1761
01:11:27,782 --> 01:11:33,454
- This is one that I think
does has views on both sides.

1762
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,355
- Yeah.

1763
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,556
(bell ringing)

1764
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:36,724
- [Michael] That
is a lot of sevens.

1765
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:39,693
If our control group is
already maxing out like that,

1766
01:11:39,694 --> 01:11:42,062
well then our scale has
no room in that direction

1767
01:11:42,063 --> 01:11:44,631
to show any effective
mortality salience.

1768
01:11:44,632 --> 01:11:46,734
Discovering issues like this,

1769
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:49,703
learning how to better isolate
mortality salient's effect

1770
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:51,972
is exactly what a
pilot test is for.

1771
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:53,107
Hey!
- Hey.

1772
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,742
- Personal differences, huh?

1773
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,477
- Yeah.

1774
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,679
- An imposter with no medical
training posed as a surgeon

1775
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,882
and bungled a minor operation
to remove a child's tonsils.

1776
01:12:01,883 --> 01:12:04,752
The patient recovered fully
after additional treatment.

1777
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:08,555
One is six months on probation,
seven is 10 years in prison.

1778
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:09,723
(upbeat music)

1779
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:13,861
- Okay, if you are taking
on the persona of a doctor,

1780
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,663
we expect good behavior.

1781
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:20,634
(bell ringing)

1782
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:22,102
- The surgeon
botched the operation

1783
01:12:22,103 --> 01:12:24,638
and was found to be under
the influence of narcotics,

1784
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:26,507
causing her to have
permanent hoarseness

1785
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,108
and ruining her career.

1786
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:29,443
(bell ringing)

1787
01:12:29,444 --> 01:12:31,945
(upbeat music)

1788
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:34,548
A 16 year old girl who had
just received her license

1789
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:36,183
drove through a red
light hitting another car

1790
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:39,153
that was being driven
by a talented pianist.

1791
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:40,687
(bell ringing)

1792
01:12:40,688 --> 01:12:42,923
(upbeat music)

1793
01:12:42,924 --> 01:12:45,192
A couple was taking their two
children to the playground

1794
01:12:45,193 --> 01:12:47,528
when they saw a woman
sunbathing nude.

1795
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,462
- Look at that

1796
01:12:48,463 --> 01:12:49,663
there could be a gender gap.

1797
01:12:49,664 --> 01:12:52,699
We're also learning a lot about
the world views people have.

1798
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,568
- [Jeff] Yeah, absolutely.

1799
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:55,469
(bell ringing)

1800
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:58,505
(upbeat music)

1801
01:12:58,506 --> 01:13:00,507
- An anti government
protester was arrested

1802
01:13:00,508 --> 01:13:03,043
for spring painting profanities
at the Lincoln Memorial

1803
01:13:03,044 --> 01:13:04,611
in Washington, DC.

1804
01:13:04,612 --> 01:13:06,013
One, 40 hours.

1805
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,081
- Wow, she went one right away.

1806
01:13:08,082 --> 01:13:09,850
- Five years in prison.
- She's not a fan

1807
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:12,219
of authority and rules.
- Yeah.

1808
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,121
(bell ringing)

1809
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:16,523
(upbeat music)

1810
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:18,525
- Okay, thank you so
much for your time.

1811
01:13:18,526 --> 01:13:19,660
I really appreciate it.

1812
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,628
- All right, so
here's the results

1813
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:23,997
and the mathematical analysis.

1814
01:13:23,998 --> 01:13:26,033
These are averages per question.

1815
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:29,136
These are the averages and
medians per participant.

1816
01:13:29,137 --> 01:13:31,672
- The fours are great,
the three is great.

1817
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,641
- But this is grounds
for optimism, at least.

1818
01:13:34,642 --> 01:13:36,810
- Seven was the max
sentencing value

1819
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:40,914
and our control group
gave an average of 4.5.

1820
01:13:40,915 --> 01:13:43,517
I'm really happy with
that as a control group.

1821
01:13:43,518 --> 01:13:44,785
- Absolutely.

1822
01:13:44,786 --> 01:13:47,621
- [Michael] Now, our
experimental groups.

1823
01:13:47,622 --> 01:13:49,256
Remember, they will
be seeing posters

1824
01:13:49,257 --> 01:13:51,725
that remind them of
their own mortality

1825
01:13:51,726 --> 01:13:54,628
and will be asked different
questions in their questionnaire

1826
01:13:54,629 --> 01:13:57,631
for example, please
describe the emotions

1827
01:13:57,632 --> 01:14:01,034
that the thought of your
own death arouses in you.

1828
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:04,538
And write down as
specifically as you can,

1829
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:08,775
what you think will happen
to you physically as you die.

1830
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:11,545
The point is to prime
their mortality salience.

1831
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:12,779
Let's see if this group

1832
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:17,618
is more punitive towards
worldview violations.

1833
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:20,120
- After raising millions of
dollars to fund education

1834
01:14:20,121 --> 01:14:22,856
for needy children,
a fundraising manager

1835
01:14:22,857 --> 01:14:24,024
fled with all the money

1836
01:14:24,025 --> 01:14:26,660
and was arrested months
later in Tasmania.

1837
01:14:26,661 --> 01:14:28,729
One, three months in prison,

1838
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,965
seven, 10 years in
prison, please answer now.

1839
01:14:31,966 --> 01:14:35,035
(upbeat music)

1840
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:37,538
- He's thinking about it.

1841
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:40,774
- Please hold up your answers.

1842
01:14:40,775 --> 01:14:42,676
All right, thank you so much.

1843
01:14:42,677 --> 01:14:44,711
- Ah, okay.

1844
01:14:44,712 --> 01:14:45,846
(bell ringing)

1845
01:14:45,847 --> 01:14:48,649
(upbeat music)

1846
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,552
- An imposter with no medical
training posed as a surgeon

1847
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:55,055
and bungled a minor operation
to remove a child's tonsils.

1848
01:14:55,056 --> 01:14:59,726
One, six months on probation,
seven, 10 years in prison.

1849
01:14:59,727 --> 01:15:03,130
(upbeat music)

1850
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,332
- They are thinking a lot more.

1851
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:06,166
- Yeah.

1852
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:14,074
(upbeat music)

1853
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:15,943
(laughing)

1854
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:19,179
- A 10, I'm pretty sure she
knows that seven is the highest.

1855
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,647
- We'll call it a seven yeah.

1856
01:15:20,648 --> 01:15:22,749
- It's funny to see when
people feel bold enough,

1857
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,085
even though I'm like
breaking the bounds

1858
01:15:25,086 --> 01:15:27,120
and the rules of the task.

1859
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:27,988
(bell ringing)

1860
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:31,024
(upbeat music)

1861
01:15:31,025 --> 01:15:32,993
- An anti government
protester was arrested

1862
01:15:32,994 --> 01:15:34,628
for painting profanities

1863
01:15:34,629 --> 01:15:38,131
at the Lincoln Memorial
in Washington DC.

1864
01:15:38,132 --> 01:15:40,734
(upbeat music)

1865
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:43,370
- I really do appreciate
the way they clearly

1866
01:15:43,371 --> 01:15:47,007
seem to be taking a bit
more time to deliberate.

1867
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:48,308
- Yeah.

1868
01:15:48,309 --> 01:15:54,114
(upbeat music)

1869
01:15:54,115 --> 01:15:54,982
(bell ringing)

1870
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:58,285
(upbeat music)

1871
01:15:58,286 --> 01:15:59,253
- Okay, they can
put the papers down

1872
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:02,122
and tell them that we
will be in shortly.

1873
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:03,323
- Okay, thank you so much.

1874
01:16:03,324 --> 01:16:04,458
We finished with this
part of the study.

1875
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,827
So if you don't mind just
hanging out for a moment.

1876
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,795
And our researchers will
be in here in a moment

1877
01:16:08,796 --> 01:16:10,797
to ask you a couple questions.

1878
01:16:10,798 --> 01:16:13,266
- Let's find out if the
reminders of mortality,

1879
01:16:13,267 --> 01:16:16,637
we showed our experimental
group were salient enough.

1880
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:17,671
- Let me ask you
about one thing,

1881
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:19,239
out in the waiting room,

1882
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,742
did you all notice
the posters at all?

1883
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,111
- [All] Yes.

1884
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,812
- Okay.

1885
01:16:25,813 --> 01:16:26,980
- I was surprised as soon
as they walked in the door,

1886
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:29,149
and I saw the gravestones.

1887
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:30,884
- Yeah, that's right.

1888
01:16:30,885 --> 01:16:33,920
- I wondered what
did I get into?

1889
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:35,889
- So we are looking
into something

1890
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,226
that's called Terror
Management Theory.

1891
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,863
And it's the idea that your
own awareness of your mortality

1892
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:46,667
can affect the behaviors
that you exhibit,

1893
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,169
that we all manage the
terror that we feel

1894
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:52,706
knowing that we are mortal,
by behaving in certain ways,

1895
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:55,776
especially in ways that
reinforce our own worldviews

1896
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:58,712
because we can kind of live
on through the societies

1897
01:16:58,713 --> 01:17:01,348
and cultures and identities
that we have today.

1898
01:17:01,349 --> 01:17:03,050
- Did any of you feel like
you were still thinking

1899
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,251
a little bit about death

1900
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:06,153
when you were came in here?

1901
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,321
- I was definitely
going after people

1902
01:17:08,322 --> 01:17:11,425
who transgressed against my
worldview to use your terms.

1903
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:12,726
Yes, I noticed that.

1904
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:14,227
Yes, I was definitely
doing that.

1905
01:17:14,228 --> 01:17:16,396
- So this was
incredibly helpful.

1906
01:17:16,397 --> 01:17:19,900
Thank you very much
for your participation.

1907
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,703
It looks like our experimental
stimuli were successful.

1908
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:25,038
They were salient, but they
didn't cause the participants

1909
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:27,474
to think they were
related to the study.

1910
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:32,079
- The control participants
averaged about 4.5.

1911
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:37,451
The experimental participants
were close to 4.7.

1912
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:41,755
So there's a slight tendency
for the experimental people

1913
01:17:41,756 --> 01:17:44,357
to be leaning in the
direction that we predicted.

1914
01:17:44,358 --> 01:17:47,327
But we're talking
about relatively

1915
01:17:47,328 --> 01:17:48,729
inconsequential differences.

1916
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:49,930
- That's right.

1917
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,832
It just makes me hungry
to run more people.

1918
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:52,666
And with the number that we had,

1919
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:55,102
That's statistically
insignificant.

1920
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:58,138
Do you think that we
did see any effects

1921
01:17:58,139 --> 01:18:00,173
of mortality salience today?

1922
01:18:00,174 --> 01:18:02,743
- I feel like the
mortality salient groups

1923
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,212
tended to take a little
longer before responding

1924
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:06,146
- Yeah me, too.

1925
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:07,514
- And they seem more thoughtful.

1926
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:10,150
they really put more
effort into trying

1927
01:18:10,151 --> 01:18:11,351
to do the right thing.

1928
01:18:11,352 --> 01:18:12,486
- The difference
was dramatic enough

1929
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:13,520
that we picked up on it.

1930
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:14,655
- Absolutely.

1931
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:16,356
- [Michael] Although our
stimuli might need to go through

1932
01:18:16,357 --> 01:18:18,191
a couple more passes
and some more vetting,

1933
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:20,794
we did find an interesting
difference in the time

1934
01:18:20,795 --> 01:18:22,462
it took for our
groups to respond.

1935
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:25,065
Our control group took an
average of four minutes

1936
01:18:25,066 --> 01:18:27,968
and 46 seconds to decide
on their punishments.

1937
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:30,303
But our experimental
group took an average

1938
01:18:30,304 --> 01:18:33,073
of seven minutes, 18 seconds.

1939
01:18:33,074 --> 01:18:36,109
- In a sense that really
is the prediction,

1940
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:37,811
the right thing by
their own worldview.

1941
01:18:37,812 --> 01:18:40,147
But by the same token,
when we think about death,

1942
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:41,481
we wanna do what's right.

1943
01:18:41,482 --> 01:18:43,016
And if we're acting like jurors,

1944
01:18:43,017 --> 01:18:45,819
we wanna make the
right decisions.

1945
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:47,788
- As we very much learned today,

1946
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:51,391
the goal isn't to prove one
thing one way or the other.

1947
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:54,127
It's just to reduce uncertainty.

1948
01:18:54,128 --> 01:18:56,129
In the most careful
way possible.

1949
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,831
- Absolutely.

1950
01:18:57,832 --> 01:19:01,835
To know a little bit more
today than we did yesterday.

1951
01:19:01,836 --> 01:19:04,471
- Whoa, okay, we have
a lot to talk about.

1952
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:06,473
And luckily, I've got just
the person here with me

1953
01:19:06,474 --> 01:19:09,376
to talk about all
of this with Judy Ho

1954
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,545
a clinical neuropsychologist,

1955
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:15,549
tenured professor at Pepperdine,
you run your own practice,

1956
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,884
you work with ethics a lot.

1957
01:19:17,885 --> 01:19:19,519
What is your actual position?

1958
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,155
- So I'm the chair of the
institutional review board

1959
01:19:22,156 --> 01:19:23,857
at Pepperdine University,

1960
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:25,158
which is how we first
started working together

1961
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:27,561
because you were doing
the trolley experiment.

1962
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:29,229
And that was an interesting
thing to talk about.

1963
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:31,832
- Yes, if you have seen
the trolley problem episode

1964
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,868
of Mind Field you
have seen Judy there

1965
01:19:34,869 --> 01:19:36,036
helping us with the ethics

1966
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,538
of can we make people think
they've committed murder?

1967
01:19:38,539 --> 01:19:39,506
Is that okay?

1968
01:19:39,507 --> 01:19:41,575
Maybe it's not okay for
the university to do,

1969
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,577
but can a TV show do it?

1970
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:45,378
Bottom line is we learned a lot.

1971
01:19:45,379 --> 01:19:48,548
And so, Judy, I wanted you
here today to talk with me

1972
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:53,253
about running experiments
on people, okay.

1973
01:19:53,254 --> 01:19:59,159
But also running experiments
on people for a TV show.

1974
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,294
Because there are all
kinds of limitations

1975
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:02,429
and issues that come up.

1976
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:07,133
And I think that what we
just saw is a great example

1977
01:20:07,134 --> 01:20:10,303
of all the different
things that happen,

1978
01:20:10,304 --> 01:20:11,872
that are both good and bad,

1979
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:13,974
challenges and
opportunities for Mind Field

1980
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,009
when it comes to
psychological experiments.

1981
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,210
- Sure.

1982
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:20,046
- So the biggest
problem we have is,

1983
01:20:20,047 --> 01:20:22,315
it's not possible for us to run

1984
01:20:22,316 --> 01:20:25,418
enormous numbers
of participants.

1985
01:20:25,419 --> 01:20:27,587
We have a very tight schedule,

1986
01:20:27,588 --> 01:20:29,890
and we have a whole
crew working with us,

1987
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:32,492
we cannot run hundreds
or thousands of people,

1988
01:20:32,493 --> 01:20:36,096
we can run like a couple dozen.

1989
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:39,666
And sometimes that's
not enough to really get

1990
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:43,236
a statistically
significant result.

1991
01:20:43,237 --> 01:20:44,471
- Right.

1992
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:49,276
- Also, I think it's
very clear here.

1993
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:53,546
The kinds of participants
who come on to the show,

1994
01:20:53,547 --> 01:20:55,515
they don't even know
they're on a TV show,

1995
01:20:55,516 --> 01:20:57,250
by the way until the end
when we debrief them,

1996
01:20:57,251 --> 01:21:01,655
but the kinds of people who
are available here in LA,

1997
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,223
in the middle of the day.

1998
01:21:03,224 --> 01:21:05,659
- Right.

1999
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,594
- Is a both a very narrow

2000
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:09,529
and a very wide group of people.

2001
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:10,497
- Right.

2002
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:11,698
- If we were running
this at a University,

2003
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:14,367
and we needed people to be
free in the middle of the day,

2004
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:16,503
we would get a very
homogenous group.

2005
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:18,071
- Yeah.

2006
01:21:18,072 --> 01:21:19,539
- They would be
predominantly young people

2007
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,374
between like 19 and 22,

2008
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:23,476
their worldviews would
be pretty similar.

2009
01:21:23,477 --> 01:21:27,013
I mean, they're all at
the same institution,

2010
01:21:27,014 --> 01:21:29,649
they're probably socio
economically pretty well off,

2011
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:31,651
because they're at
this university.

2012
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:36,423
Their cultural backgrounds
might be much more similar

2013
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:39,059
than what we find working in TV,

2014
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:43,430
where we might get retired
people and immigrants

2015
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:47,267
and really young people and
actors, a lot of actors.

2016
01:21:47,268 --> 01:21:48,468
- Right, yes.

2017
01:21:48,469 --> 01:21:50,236
- Oh, my gosh, the
number of people in LA,

2018
01:21:50,237 --> 01:21:52,605
who were free to do studies
in the middle of the day,

2019
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:56,343
who part time actors is a huge,

2020
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:59,579
which that always leads to the
issue of the audience at home

2021
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,681
goes, wait a second, and
they Google up something

2022
01:22:01,682 --> 01:22:04,617
and they go, that person
was on a TV show, right?

2023
01:22:04,618 --> 01:22:06,486
Is this all just fake?

2024
01:22:06,487 --> 01:22:08,588
And it's like,
that's what it's like

2025
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:11,658
to just grab who's
available in LA.

2026
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:15,562
But because of the
diversity that we get,

2027
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:19,632
I think our populations
represent the country better.

2028
01:22:19,633 --> 01:22:22,268
But also, we have
way more noise.

2029
01:22:22,269 --> 01:22:23,570
- Yes.

2030
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,539
- Questions about how
bad is it to deface

2031
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:29,576
an American monument
are going to have

2032
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:33,546
very different answers
from different people.

2033
01:22:33,547 --> 01:22:35,215
- Absolutely.

2034
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:38,318
- And in this particular
study, we had that problem.

2035
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:40,420
We're trying to see if you'll
enforce your worldview,

2036
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:41,755
more or less if you're reminded

2037
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,723
that you're going
to die someday,

2038
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:45,692
and the issue was that
everyone showing up

2039
01:22:45,693 --> 01:22:47,527
had very different worldviews.

2040
01:22:47,528 --> 01:22:48,661
- Yes.

2041
01:22:48,662 --> 01:22:49,596
All right, so I've just thrown

2042
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:50,530
a whole bunch of stuff at you,

2043
01:22:50,531 --> 01:22:52,032
- A lot of stuff to talk about.

2044
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,166
Well, first of all, I
thought it was fascinating

2045
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:54,634
the way that it was set up.

2046
01:22:54,635 --> 01:22:56,703
And it was a really, really
good episode to watch.

2047
01:22:56,704 --> 01:22:59,506
And, just to see the
reactions of the proponents

2048
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:00,573
of the theory that was so cool

2049
01:23:00,574 --> 01:23:01,441
that you got them to be in it.

2050
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:05,178
'Cause they are
invested in the theory.

2051
01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:06,413
- That was so cool.

2052
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,515
And both of them wrote
all of those scenarios.

2053
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:13,453
And it was truly
science in action.

2054
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:15,388
They came up with scenarios,

2055
01:23:15,389 --> 01:23:18,324
we found out Wow, some of
these are just so extreme,

2056
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:20,727
even to a control group
that we don't see any room

2057
01:23:20,728 --> 01:23:24,397
for any other variables to
change in that direction.

2058
01:23:24,398 --> 01:23:28,068
So we had to rewrite
them in between days,

2059
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:31,471
and gosh, it was true science.

2060
01:23:31,472 --> 01:23:33,440
- Yeah, no, it was really
cool to see it in action.

2061
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,708
And it was really cool
to see how different

2062
01:23:35,709 --> 01:23:37,644
the control group and the
experimental group was

2063
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:40,713
in terms of the latency and
even their facial responses,

2064
01:23:40,714 --> 01:23:42,715
as they were
considering all of this.

2065
01:23:42,716 --> 01:23:45,251
I certainly saw that
being a significant effect

2066
01:23:45,252 --> 01:23:46,653
that they just seemed
like they were taking

2067
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:49,155
their roles so much
more seriously, right.

2068
01:23:49,156 --> 01:23:50,523
Whereas sometimes when
you get these people

2069
01:23:50,524 --> 01:23:52,592
to come in for an
experimental study,

2070
01:23:52,593 --> 01:23:53,727
they're just here
for their whatever,

2071
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,629
$10 or whatever you're
offering them for their time.

2072
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:58,765
And, they're more
haphazard about it.

2073
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:00,733
And I certainly saw that
with a second group,

2074
01:24:00,734 --> 01:24:05,438
there was just this real
pronounced sense of gravity

2075
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:07,140
to their considerations.

2076
01:24:07,141 --> 01:24:08,842
- Yeah, we thought,

2077
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:14,414
what the severity of punishment
dealt out, that will be

2078
01:24:14,415 --> 01:24:17,851
the variable that will change
based on mortality sale.

2079
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:21,321
But it turned out to be
disposition and thoughtfulness.

2080
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:22,489
- Totally.

2081
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,491
- Luckily, we recorded
the whole thing.

2082
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:27,227
So we could go back and
say, how long did they take?

2083
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,495
That wasn't originally measured,

2084
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,530
but because of the
footage, we could time.

2085
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:32,899
And we found out that it
took almost twice as long

2086
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,634
for the group that
came in thinking,

2087
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:35,869
I've just written an essay

2088
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:38,605
about what I think
death will be like.

2089
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:41,641
Punishing people for
violating cultural norms.

2090
01:24:41,642 --> 01:24:44,711
This is a heavy thing, too,
and they reacted differently.

2091
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:47,380
- Yeah, and I think
that it may not be

2092
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:48,882
I mean, I understand
the original tenants

2093
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:50,316
of Terror Management Theory.

2094
01:24:50,317 --> 01:24:52,652
But I can also imagine
when somebody is really,

2095
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:54,821
really very cognizant
of their mortality,

2096
01:24:54,822 --> 01:24:57,223
that they might actually
be more lenient,

2097
01:24:57,224 --> 01:24:59,459
like life is short,
I want this person

2098
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,693
to have a second chance.

2099
01:25:00,694 --> 01:25:02,262
And so I think part of
what wasn't measured

2100
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,663
that might have been helpful

2101
01:25:03,664 --> 01:25:06,666
is actually trying to
counterbalance the two groups

2102
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:10,503
in terms of do you have the
same types of belief systems,

2103
01:25:10,504 --> 01:25:11,771
and ideologies, right?

2104
01:25:11,772 --> 01:25:13,506
Because if we don't have that,

2105
01:25:13,507 --> 01:25:15,675
then they're kind of just
going at their own values.

2106
01:25:15,676 --> 01:25:17,210
And if we don't know
very much about it,

2107
01:25:17,211 --> 01:25:19,212
you can see why that
noise could contribute

2108
01:25:19,213 --> 01:25:21,714
to the average being 4.5
and 4.7 in the two groups.

2109
01:25:21,715 --> 01:25:23,883
- Exactly, which is basically
no difference at all right?

2110
01:25:23,884 --> 01:25:25,485
- Right, yeah.

2111
01:25:25,486 --> 01:25:27,453
- But yes, I think in
hindsight, and this is, again,

2112
01:25:27,454 --> 01:25:29,522
the whole point of
science is to be like,

2113
01:25:29,523 --> 01:25:31,257
all right, what can we learn?

2114
01:25:31,258 --> 01:25:33,626
And how can we keep at all times

2115
01:25:33,627 --> 01:25:37,830
the uncertainty on this
track down and down?

2116
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:40,266
And right, if we kind of knew

2117
01:25:40,267 --> 01:25:42,302
what people's worldviews
were ahead of time,

2118
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:45,505
like if we had interviewed
them a couple of weeks before,

2119
01:25:45,506 --> 01:25:48,908
long enough ago, that they don't
remember it anymore, right?

2120
01:25:48,909 --> 01:25:51,477
Make them somehow not
think that it matters

2121
01:25:51,478 --> 01:25:53,646
too much that the
questions are related,

2122
01:25:53,647 --> 01:25:57,317
then the test, I think, could
have given us better results

2123
01:25:57,318 --> 01:26:00,587
in terms of the punishments
dealt out and all of that.

2124
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,655
And it can be frustrating
when you wanna do a show,

2125
01:26:02,656 --> 01:26:04,691
and you wanna show
results and teach,

2126
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:07,660
but you also want to experiment.

2127
01:26:07,661 --> 01:26:09,629
And sometimes the experiment
won't always leave you

2128
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:11,664
with everything nicely tied up.

2129
01:26:11,665 --> 01:26:12,632
- Right.

2130
01:26:12,633 --> 01:26:14,534
- And that's a good
lesson to give people

2131
01:26:14,535 --> 01:26:18,304
but it has been frustrating
to do experiments

2132
01:26:18,305 --> 01:26:19,973
where you need a big
population of people,

2133
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:22,375
it's easier on the Mind Field,

2134
01:26:22,376 --> 01:26:24,377
to make myself the guinea pig.

2135
01:26:24,378 --> 01:26:25,645
Or focus on a topic where

2136
01:26:25,646 --> 01:26:27,313
we just need to see
it happen one time.

2137
01:26:27,314 --> 01:26:28,548
- Right, right.

2138
01:26:28,549 --> 01:26:31,451
- Like can I get someone to
falsely confessed to a crime?

2139
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,620
If I get one person to
do it, then we're done.

2140
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,022
But if I wanna see a
tendency for people

2141
01:26:36,023 --> 01:26:38,725
to be more punitive
to worldview,

2142
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:43,630
their worldview violations,
if they're reminded of death,

2143
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:44,998
I really need to run
hundreds of people.

2144
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:48,768
So I mean, what do
you what do you think?

2145
01:26:48,769 --> 01:26:51,738
Do we need to remind the
audience of that every time?

2146
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:52,705
- Honestly, I don't think so.

2147
01:26:52,706 --> 01:26:54,474
And I would say, first of all,

2148
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:57,343
that social
psychology experiences
(mumbles) especially,

2149
01:26:57,344 --> 01:26:58,678
are built on the backbone

2150
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:01,681
of very homogenous populations,

2151
01:27:01,682 --> 01:27:04,517
it's tended to always involve
undergraduate students

2152
01:27:04,518 --> 01:27:07,453
who are given the
option of either doing

2153
01:27:07,454 --> 01:27:10,356
this 10 minute experiment
or writing a 15 page paper.

2154
01:27:10,357 --> 01:27:12,692
It's not really very
ethical, actually.

2155
01:27:12,693 --> 01:27:15,595
Because you're kind of coercing
them towards the experiment.

2156
01:27:15,596 --> 01:27:16,796
And so you're gonna
get lots of first

2157
01:27:16,797 --> 01:27:18,965
and second year
psychology students.

2158
01:27:18,966 --> 01:27:21,334
And, again, it's
still for a class.

2159
01:27:21,335 --> 01:27:23,002
So how honest are
they really being?

2160
01:27:23,003 --> 01:27:25,605
Because what if the
professor discovers

2161
01:27:25,606 --> 01:27:26,439
what their answers are?

2162
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,840
And so there's all
kinds of things

2163
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:30,710
that are already
inherently an issue,

2164
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:33,680
and even the published
studies and social psychology.

2165
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:36,683
And I think what a TV
experiment really does

2166
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:39,585
that I don't think
any more kind of,

2167
01:27:39,586 --> 01:27:41,587
planned out research
study with hundreds

2168
01:27:41,588 --> 01:27:43,623
and thousands of
participants will do,

2169
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:47,760
is a really lively and
visual demonstration.

2170
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:49,395
And that in itself
is really useful.

2171
01:27:49,396 --> 01:27:50,630
Because if somebody
actually says,

2172
01:27:50,631 --> 01:27:52,498
Now, I wanna take
that study protocol,

2173
01:27:52,499 --> 01:27:53,633
and apply it to 500 people,

2174
01:27:53,634 --> 01:27:54,901
they now have a
template to do that--

2175
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:56,602
- Which they should
do, by the way,

2176
01:27:56,603 --> 01:27:58,871
please do that, that would be,

2177
01:27:58,872 --> 01:28:00,740
Mind Field would
have done its job.

2178
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:04,043
But yeah, I think
the responsibility

2179
01:28:04,044 --> 01:28:09,916
I have with Mind Field is to
document how science is done,

2180
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:10,850
and what results might look like

2181
01:28:10,851 --> 01:28:12,385
and what the protocols can be.

2182
01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:13,520
And then the comments

2183
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,455
might have been full of
people with different ideas,

2184
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:17,590
how it would have
been a differently
and I'm like, perfect.

2185
01:28:17,591 --> 01:28:19,425
- Awesome that people wanna
weigh in and be so engaged--

2186
01:28:19,426 --> 01:28:22,729
- Exactly go off and do that,

2187
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:25,398
we really didn't know how
that experiment would go.

2188
01:28:25,399 --> 01:28:27,400
And I still don't
know how it would go

2189
01:28:27,401 --> 01:28:29,869
if you change one little
thing in one way or the other.

2190
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:31,104
- Well, and I
think it also shows

2191
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:33,773
the beauty of what an
ad hoc analysis can do.

2192
01:28:33,774 --> 01:28:35,541
Like oftentimes you
have your hypotheses,

2193
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:38,144
like, for example,
your hypothesis was
that you would go in

2194
01:28:38,145 --> 01:28:40,747
and you would see that there
was gonna be more severity

2195
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:42,915
in terms of ratings
of punishment in the
experimental group.

2196
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:45,618
But actually, you
didn't see that.

2197
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:47,587
And then you thought that
something else was happening,

2198
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:48,988
because we saw the videotape.

2199
01:28:48,989 --> 01:28:51,424
And, oh, it's how
long they took.

2200
01:28:51,425 --> 01:28:53,126
And you were able to go
back and call that data

2201
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:54,527
and to make a
statement about that.

2202
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,696
And that difference
was significant.

2203
01:28:56,697 --> 01:28:58,598
It was almost doubled
the amount of time

2204
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:01,501
that the experimental group,
it was cool to see that.

2205
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:02,735
- It was cool.

2206
01:29:02,736 --> 01:29:04,404
And you could feel a
difference in the mood

2207
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:06,038
which it's hard to measure.

2208
01:29:06,039 --> 01:29:08,040
But you know what,
when you are recording

2209
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:12,578
everything from multiple
angles, you have that evidence,

2210
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:14,046
right, you have
that documentation.

2211
01:29:14,047 --> 01:29:15,782
- They seem stressed.

2212
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,049
Like, when I was watching
them, I felt bad for them.

2213
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:19,719
They they just looked so upset.

2214
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,654
- They weren't fun scenario,

2215
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:22,989
it's like hey, this
person botched a surgery

2216
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,558
because they lied about
their qualifications.

2217
01:29:25,559 --> 01:29:27,627
Or this doctor got
drunk and hurt someone.

2218
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:29,562
There are pretty bad things
to think about, anyway,

2219
01:29:29,563 --> 01:29:32,198
- This really just brings up
though, kind of the spirit

2220
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:34,467
of why we do experiments
in the first place,

2221
01:29:34,468 --> 01:29:36,736
because it's always a
cost benefit analysis.

2222
01:29:36,737 --> 01:29:37,670
And I think we talked about this

2223
01:29:37,671 --> 01:29:39,439
also on the trolley episode.

2224
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,508
It's really about what kind
of information you're getting.

2225
01:29:42,509 --> 01:29:43,743
Are you just torturing
people for fun

2226
01:29:43,744 --> 01:29:45,812
and using your hidden
cameras for fun?

2227
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:48,614
Or are you providing some kind
of educational value or a way

2228
01:29:48,615 --> 01:29:51,651
that people can process
important issues like mortality?

2229
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,953
When I first saw
you in the casket,

2230
01:29:53,954 --> 01:29:56,222
I gotta tell you, that's
one of my worst fears.

2231
01:29:56,223 --> 01:29:58,658
We talked about this on the
most recent episode I worked on

2232
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:01,561
with you that, that is my
biggest fear, is death.

2233
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:04,797
So that you are providing
some value and insight

2234
01:30:04,798 --> 01:30:06,966
to people who are thinking
about how do I make the most

2235
01:30:06,967 --> 01:30:08,201
of my time on this earth?

2236
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,803
And does it mean if I
take my moral decisions

2237
01:30:10,804 --> 01:30:11,904
a little bit more carefully,

2238
01:30:11,905 --> 01:30:13,639
that I'm gonna feel better
about myself in my life

2239
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,774
at the end of the day?

2240
01:30:14,775 --> 01:30:16,943
Because that could be
providing some kind of insight

2241
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:18,611
for people to
better their lives.

2242
01:30:18,612 --> 01:30:22,648
- Yeah, that's my favorite part
of every experiment we run,

2243
01:30:22,649 --> 01:30:23,883
the debriefing
where I get to say,

2244
01:30:23,884 --> 01:30:25,618
here's what we're studying.

2245
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:28,521
And people they've never gone,

2246
01:30:28,522 --> 01:30:30,523
"Okay, cool, can I
get my money now?"

2247
01:30:30,524 --> 01:30:31,891
They're always like,
well, they want the money.

2248
01:30:31,892 --> 01:30:35,194
But also, of course,
they're like, wow, oh, yeah.

2249
01:30:35,195 --> 01:30:38,598
'cause I was feeling this,
and, they're excited,

2250
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,666
to think about it on
the on the car home,

2251
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:42,969
and they're gonna tell their
friends about it that night.

2252
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:45,505
And I hope it does a
lot of good for them,

2253
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:46,706
even if sometimes,

2254
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:48,975
they may have been a little
bit scared halfway through.

2255
01:30:48,976 --> 01:30:50,543
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2256
01:30:50,544 --> 01:30:52,845
And I think that that
is really the core

2257
01:30:52,846 --> 01:30:55,681
of why the experiments
are important on TV,

2258
01:30:55,682 --> 01:30:58,084
because, you are gonna get
a more engaged audience.

2259
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:00,920
And if it encourages people
to think about themselves,

2260
01:31:00,921 --> 01:31:02,955
and to encourage
personal development
to tell their friends

2261
01:31:02,956 --> 01:31:05,224
and family, then I think
you've done a great job.

2262
01:31:05,225 --> 01:31:07,059
So I don't think that you
have to necessarily say,

2263
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,728
and by the way, maybe
this experiment,

2264
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,696
will turn out different if
you had 500 people running it,

2265
01:31:10,697 --> 01:31:13,132
because the visual
aspects of the experiment,

2266
01:31:13,133 --> 01:31:15,668
as it is built is what's
triggering these people

2267
01:31:15,669 --> 01:31:17,203
to really do that
self evaluation

2268
01:31:17,204 --> 01:31:18,304
versus reading it on a page.

2269
01:31:18,305 --> 01:31:20,940
I mean, that's part of the
problem with experiments

2270
01:31:20,941 --> 01:31:23,809
is that they're in these
journals that you have to be

2271
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:25,010
a psychologist to subscribe

2272
01:31:25,011 --> 01:31:28,180
or just a really interested
person who's not a psychologist,

2273
01:31:28,181 --> 01:31:31,951
that you wanna pay
your $500 a year.

2274
01:31:31,952 --> 01:31:34,153
- Because you're getting like
a weekly thing, and it's huge.

2275
01:31:34,154 --> 01:31:35,087
Oh, my gosh!

2276
01:31:35,088 --> 01:31:36,722
- No one's gonna read that.

2277
01:31:36,723 --> 01:31:37,823
So this is a great way for
people to understand experiments

2278
01:31:37,824 --> 01:31:40,326
and not feel afraid, a lot
of people will tell me,

2279
01:31:40,327 --> 01:31:41,794
I'm afraid to run experiments.

2280
01:31:41,795 --> 01:31:42,962
That seems like a
lot of work to do.

2281
01:31:42,963 --> 01:31:45,064
Well, the way that it was
broken down in the episode,

2282
01:31:45,065 --> 01:31:47,667
it doesn't really
look like people

2283
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,702
can't do a version of
it themselves sometimes.

2284
01:31:49,703 --> 01:31:50,837
- It did take a lot of work.

2285
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:52,872
We have the best crew ever--
- You made it look easy.

2286
01:31:52,873 --> 01:31:56,008
- Yeah, we made it look
easy, love to hear that.

2287
01:31:56,009 --> 01:31:59,145
I also think what we
just saw is a good way

2288
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:02,748
to talk about
hidden camera shows.

2289
01:32:02,749 --> 01:32:03,983
- Yeah.

2290
01:32:03,984 --> 01:32:05,851
Because a common
question I get is,

2291
01:32:05,852 --> 01:32:08,788
how do the people not
know they're on TV?

2292
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:12,758
How do they not see the cameras?

2293
01:32:12,759 --> 01:32:16,329
And they don't, we
do a really good job.

2294
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,764
I mean, we're in LA,

2295
01:32:18,765 --> 01:32:21,867
and I'm working with the
best hidden camera people.

2296
01:32:21,868 --> 01:32:23,803
I mean, I go into the
room, and I'm like,

2297
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:25,037
but aren't we gonna film this?

2298
01:32:25,038 --> 01:32:26,973
And they're like, we're
filming it right now.

2299
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:28,641
- From five cameras.

2300
01:32:28,642 --> 01:32:30,142
- Yeah, the ways they
have the disguise cameras,

2301
01:32:30,143 --> 01:32:33,145
I've always said we need
to cover that on the show.

2302
01:32:33,146 --> 01:32:36,382
So that people know how well
hidden the cameras were.

2303
01:32:36,383 --> 01:32:37,783
- Yeah, 'cause they were
excellent angles too--

2304
01:32:37,784 --> 01:32:39,652
you got really good--
- I know, but guess what

2305
01:32:39,653 --> 01:32:41,387
the producers are like, no,

2306
01:32:41,388 --> 01:32:43,289
because then people
will know the secrets,

2307
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:45,091
and they'll know
what to look at.

2308
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:46,792
Trade secrets, but also,

2309
01:32:46,793 --> 01:32:48,694
they don't want future
participants to go.

2310
01:32:48,695 --> 01:32:49,895
You know what?

2311
01:32:49,896 --> 01:32:52,064
If I see that pattern,

2312
01:32:52,065 --> 01:32:55,301
there's probably a
camera behind it.

2313
01:32:55,302 --> 01:32:56,669
It works because
people don't know

2314
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,404
how we're hiding them so well.

2315
01:32:58,405 --> 01:33:01,841
If you look at the
projectors screen,

2316
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:03,776
you can see that
there's a band across it

2317
01:33:03,777 --> 01:33:04,911
of a different texture.

2318
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:07,146
And that is something that
a camera can see through.

2319
01:33:07,147 --> 01:33:09,682
But in the room, you don't
think anything of it.

2320
01:33:09,683 --> 01:33:12,084
It's just this boring
feature, and no one notices.

2321
01:33:12,085 --> 01:33:14,086
And then when we tell
them, they're on TV,

2322
01:33:14,087 --> 01:33:16,088
they're all like, what?

2323
01:33:16,089 --> 01:33:19,759
So there's a whole
other permission form
they have to sign

2324
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,627
after they learn that,

2325
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:22,261
'cause we can't tell
them beforehand,

2326
01:33:22,262 --> 01:33:25,031
or else people will act
different if they know

2327
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:26,766
that there's going
to be an audience

2328
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:27,800
out there watching later.

2329
01:33:27,801 --> 01:33:28,901
- Yes, absolutely.

2330
01:33:28,902 --> 01:33:31,170
And we see that a lot in
social psychology studies,

2331
01:33:31,171 --> 01:33:33,939
I mean, even just the presence
of more people in the room

2332
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:35,708
can already impact
how they respond.

2333
01:33:35,709 --> 01:33:38,878
So in this particular scenario,
there was one experimenter,

2334
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:40,413
it feels less like an audience.

2335
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:42,381
But sometimes you'll have
three or four experimenters

2336
01:33:42,382 --> 01:33:45,785
and it does like really,

2337
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:48,888
like in a big way affect
how people start to deal

2338
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:50,723
with themselves,
deal with each other,

2339
01:33:50,724 --> 01:33:52,692
you can sometimes see
them being more polite,

2340
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:54,760
a little bit more
ginger with things.

2341
01:33:54,761 --> 01:33:56,295
And it's only because they
think that other people

2342
01:33:56,296 --> 01:33:58,264
are watching and taking
notes about them.

2343
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:00,232
- You know what?

2344
01:34:00,233 --> 01:34:01,767
It makes me wanna bring
up something else,

2345
01:34:01,768 --> 01:34:02,868
we really need to get
back into the episode,

2346
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:05,371
but like, come on, I can
do whatever I want, right?

2347
01:34:05,372 --> 01:34:09,742
So Mind Field began,

2348
01:34:09,743 --> 01:34:11,243
as this idea I had for a show

2349
01:34:11,244 --> 01:34:14,880
that at the time I
called Prankology,

2350
01:34:14,881 --> 01:34:16,716
because when I was a
student in high school

2351
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:18,484
and college
psychology professors

2352
01:34:18,485 --> 01:34:20,820
would often show
Candid Camera clips,

2353
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:22,888
and then talk about
the social psychology

2354
01:34:22,889 --> 01:34:24,824
that was evident in those clips.

2355
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:27,059
The clips were entertaining,
the science was cool.

2356
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,761
I'm like, let's do that.

2357
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:32,164
and pranks were kind of a
thing because of Punked.

2358
01:34:32,165 --> 01:34:34,500
This was a while back, right?

2359
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:38,804
But all of the pranks that
like networks wanted to do

2360
01:34:38,805 --> 01:34:40,473
essentially only taught
one thing, fight or flight.

2361
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:42,208
They just wanted people
to get really scared

2362
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:43,943
and freaked out and
pee in their pants.

2363
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:46,812
Luckily, YouTube saw
that there was value

2364
01:34:46,813 --> 01:34:48,280
in something like this.

2365
01:34:48,281 --> 01:34:50,249
We're like, so is
anyone gonna scream?

2366
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,818
Is anyone gonna think
their car was totaled?

2367
01:34:52,819 --> 01:34:55,521
And I'm like, no, they're
just gonna respond

2368
01:34:55,522 --> 01:34:59,258
to a question with a number.

2369
01:34:59,259 --> 01:35:02,762
Interestingly, you have
to make that interesting.

2370
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:04,396
How do you have someone
fill out a survey

2371
01:35:04,397 --> 01:35:06,298
and have it be good visually?

2372
01:35:06,299 --> 01:35:08,801
Well, we came up with the
idea of having them write

2373
01:35:08,802 --> 01:35:12,772
their number and then show it
to the proctor of the study,

2374
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:14,507
so that the camera could
see what number they wrote.

2375
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:16,208
That's the whole reason
they did it that way,

2376
01:35:16,209 --> 01:35:18,477
rather than fill it
in and turn the paper.

2377
01:35:18,478 --> 01:35:20,012
- Which of course
changes results too.

2378
01:35:20,013 --> 01:35:21,514
Because if it's a
private opinion,

2379
01:35:21,515 --> 01:35:23,182
versus one that they're
showing their showing somebody.

2380
01:35:23,183 --> 01:35:25,985
- They're showing, then their
face is associated with it.

2381
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:27,520
But last at the last minute,

2382
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:29,522
we had to put those blinders up.

2383
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:31,157
So they couldn't see
what other people

2384
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:32,391
next to them were doing.

2385
01:35:32,392 --> 01:35:33,859
Because we knew that
that would affect it.

2386
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:36,028
So we had to walk
the line of, okay,

2387
01:35:36,029 --> 01:35:37,830
we want them to
put the number up

2388
01:35:37,831 --> 01:35:39,565
next to their face
for the camera,

2389
01:35:39,566 --> 01:35:41,467
but we don't want that to affect

2390
01:35:41,468 --> 01:35:42,902
how they answer the question.

2391
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:45,504
So how do we make sure
that it still feels

2392
01:35:45,505 --> 01:35:46,872
as private as possible?

2393
01:35:46,873 --> 01:35:48,040
- Right.

2394
01:35:48,041 --> 01:35:49,375
- A lot of thinking
goes in this.

2395
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:51,110
- A lot of thinking,
a lot of thinking.

2396
01:35:51,111 --> 01:35:54,346
And I also wonder to just
even the characteristics

2397
01:35:54,347 --> 01:35:55,481
of the experimenter in the room,

2398
01:35:55,482 --> 01:35:57,116
the actor that you guys hired.

2399
01:35:57,117 --> 01:35:59,218
Again, with certain
of those questions,

2400
01:35:59,219 --> 01:36:00,853
there could also be a response,

2401
01:36:00,854 --> 01:36:04,557
of well, this person might
judge me if I rate this a seven,

2402
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:06,826
just based on their
own perception

2403
01:36:06,827 --> 01:36:08,027
of what that person
might be thinking--

2404
01:36:08,028 --> 01:36:10,596
- Exactly, that is something
that is worth investigating

2405
01:36:10,597 --> 01:36:12,598
more experimenting with more.

2406
01:36:12,599 --> 01:36:19,271
What I can say is that
during those trials,

2407
01:36:19,272 --> 01:36:21,106
the direction we gave Trin,
who's our wonderful actress,

2408
01:36:21,107 --> 01:36:23,509
she's just perfect at this
kind of role, and many others,

2409
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:27,112
but we told her, you have
to kind of act bored.

2410
01:36:27,113 --> 01:36:29,081
Like you've been
doing this all day,

2411
01:36:29,082 --> 01:36:30,516
and you don't care
what they write down.

2412
01:36:30,517 --> 01:36:32,418
- Yeah, no gasps of surprise.

2413
01:36:32,419 --> 01:36:35,321
- Yeah, you're not gonna be
like, oh, you gave it a one?

2414
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:38,958
Also, she just read a script,
she read each word off a page.

2415
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:41,126
So it was always
the same language.

2416
01:36:41,127 --> 01:36:44,363
And it was just monotone, which
is a funny direction to give

2417
01:36:44,364 --> 01:36:47,099
someone who is in a like
a really talented actress.

2418
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,101
To be like, we need you to--
- As boring as possible.

2419
01:36:49,102 --> 01:36:50,336
- Be as boring as possible.

2420
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:52,338
And it's the least
acting as possible.

2421
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:53,505
- Right, right.

2422
01:36:53,506 --> 01:36:55,007
- As a little
acting as possible.

2423
01:36:55,008 --> 01:36:56,508
Judy, thank you so much.
- Thank you so fun.

2424
01:36:56,509 --> 01:36:59,044
- Always a pleasure.
- Awesome.

2425
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:01,347
- All right, we're gonna
continue watching this episode,

2426
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:03,983
when we come back, I
will have a new guest,

2427
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:05,417
but not new to you or me.

2428
01:37:05,418 --> 01:37:06,619
So actually not a
new guests at all,

2429
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,621
but I'll have a different guest.

2430
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:09,989
Let's get ready to learn more

2431
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:12,224
about whether
Michael should die.

2432
01:37:12,225 --> 01:37:14,660
(upbeat music)

2433
01:37:14,661 --> 01:37:17,529
Our pilot test shows that
there's still a lot to discover

2434
01:37:17,530 --> 01:37:21,901
about terror management, and
many promising ways to do it.

2435
01:37:21,902 --> 01:37:24,436
I'm particularly intrigued
by our observation

2436
01:37:24,437 --> 01:37:26,639
that for all the
closed mindedness,

2437
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:30,075
mortality salience appears
to cause it also led

2438
01:37:30,076 --> 01:37:34,613
to what looked like increased
consideration, and thought,

2439
01:37:34,614 --> 01:37:36,982
I'd love to see more
research on that idea.

2440
01:37:36,983 --> 01:37:38,984
But the point is this.

2441
01:37:38,985 --> 01:37:43,622
If death's effects
aren't all entirely bad,

2442
01:37:43,623 --> 01:37:47,526
what if, instead of, or
at least, at the same time

2443
01:37:47,527 --> 01:37:50,930
that we hope for the
abolition of natural death,

2444
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:55,034
we also find a way to accept it.

2445
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:59,204
Now, obviously, I don't want
to die, at least not soon.

2446
01:37:59,205 --> 01:38:01,941
But accepting the
inevitability of my own death

2447
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:08,080
and being less afraid of it
feels powerful, and honest.

2448
01:38:08,081 --> 01:38:09,248
I'd like to learn
what that looks like.

2449
01:38:09,249 --> 01:38:11,583
And I have a friend
who can help.

2450
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:16,455
(soft music)

2451
01:38:16,456 --> 01:38:19,725
I'm paying a visit to
Caitlin Doughty, a mortician,

2452
01:38:19,726 --> 01:38:22,628
author and death
positivity activist

2453
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:24,663
who has made an entire
career out of discussing

2454
01:38:24,664 --> 01:38:28,567
the aspects of death that
most of us prefer to ignore.

2455
01:38:28,568 --> 01:38:31,670
What do you say to
someone who comes to you?

2456
01:38:31,671 --> 01:38:35,174
and says, I think
death is terrifying.

2457
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:37,042
It's,

2458
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:40,612
so scary and sad that

2459
01:38:40,613 --> 01:38:42,147
I'm just here now,

2460
01:38:42,148 --> 01:38:43,082
- Is this person dying?

2461
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:44,316
Or is this person--

2462
01:38:44,317 --> 01:38:45,484
- This person is me in
front of you right now.

2463
01:38:45,485 --> 01:38:47,619
- This person is
you, okay so (laughs)

2464
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:49,254
I would tell you
a couple things.

2465
01:38:49,255 --> 01:38:50,455
First, you're dealing

2466
01:38:50,456 --> 01:38:55,394
with the primal existential
quandary of human existence.

2467
01:38:55,395 --> 01:38:56,228
- Yes.

2468
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:57,563
- And you are one of,

2469
01:38:57,564 --> 01:39:00,599
the many billions of
people who have felt this,

2470
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,268
so you're not alone
in feeling this way.

2471
01:39:03,269 --> 01:39:05,537
So we go through life,
we reach a certain age,

2472
01:39:05,538 --> 01:39:09,208
and we begin to
understand that someday,

2473
01:39:09,209 --> 01:39:12,444
ourselves, and everyone
we love will die.

2474
01:39:12,445 --> 01:39:15,781
And that's powerful,
painful knowledge.

2475
01:39:15,782 --> 01:39:17,549
And I think from that moment,

2476
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,351
we have to start developing

2477
01:39:19,352 --> 01:39:22,121
defense mechanisms
to handle that,

2478
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:24,356
and to integrate
that into our lives.

2479
01:39:24,357 --> 01:39:26,258
- So what are those
defense mechanisms?

2480
01:39:26,259 --> 01:39:30,662
- I think that the more obvious
ones would be having a child

2481
01:39:30,663 --> 01:39:32,798
writing a book,
making a TV show,

2482
01:39:32,799 --> 01:39:35,067
creating a legacy of some kind,

2483
01:39:35,068 --> 01:39:39,405
but there's also a more
insidious version, which is war,

2484
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:42,207
taking other
countries, being rich

2485
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,309
and being okay with
other people being poor.

2486
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:46,645
I think those are all
signs of death denial,

2487
01:39:46,646 --> 01:39:48,380
they're all saying, but I'm okay

2488
01:39:48,381 --> 01:39:50,616
because I have this money,
or I have this power,

2489
01:39:50,617 --> 01:39:55,387
or I have these kind of dark
impulses that allow me to say,

2490
01:39:55,388 --> 01:39:58,390
at least I can outrun
death in that way.

2491
01:39:58,391 --> 01:40:01,727
And of course, that's not
true, no one can outrun death.

2492
01:40:01,728 --> 01:40:03,695
But you can trick yourself
into believing that.

2493
01:40:03,696 --> 01:40:06,598
- So how would you characterize

2494
01:40:06,599 --> 01:40:09,134
the western
relationship to death?

2495
01:40:09,135 --> 01:40:12,337
- Take America 150 years ago,

2496
01:40:12,338 --> 01:40:15,474
if you were my
husband, and you died,

2497
01:40:15,475 --> 01:40:17,509
I would be entirely
in charge of you,

2498
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:20,179
I would wash your body,
I would get the neighbor

2499
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,247
to make a wooden coffin for you,

2500
01:40:22,248 --> 01:40:24,349
we would put you in the
coffin and carry you

2501
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:26,485
on our shoulders to the grave

2502
01:40:26,486 --> 01:40:28,187
which someone had
dug themselves.

2503
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:31,723
It would have been an entirely
self sufficient process.

2504
01:40:31,724 --> 01:40:34,793
But what happened around
the turn of the 20th century

2505
01:40:34,794 --> 01:40:37,629
is really three big
things in my mind.

2506
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:39,565
One, you had the
rise of hospitals,

2507
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:41,800
so people were no
longer dying at home,

2508
01:40:41,801 --> 01:40:43,602
you had the rise
of funeral homes,

2509
01:40:43,603 --> 01:40:47,339
which means that we are
now outsourcing our death.

2510
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,441
Third one is slaughterhouses,

2511
01:40:49,442 --> 01:40:52,377
so all of a sudden,
all food production,

2512
01:40:52,378 --> 01:40:55,614
and the killing of animals
is also hidden as well.

2513
01:40:55,615 --> 01:40:58,117
And we live in our
suburban houses

2514
01:40:58,118 --> 01:40:59,785
where all those
things are outsourced.

2515
01:40:59,786 --> 01:41:01,587
And it's just these
little layers and layers

2516
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:04,490
and layers of
denial around death.

2517
01:41:04,491 --> 01:41:08,660
- But what does it
mean to accept death?

2518
01:41:08,661 --> 01:41:12,197
- I don't think that you
ever truly accept death.

2519
01:41:12,198 --> 01:41:16,468
But I believe that the
movement toward accepting death

2520
01:41:16,469 --> 01:41:18,871
involves really
true self awareness

2521
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:22,641
about where you're hiding
your fears of death.

2522
01:41:22,642 --> 01:41:26,145
That's where real awareness
and acceptance can come from.

2523
01:41:26,146 --> 01:41:29,248
- For me, the thing that's
just such a bummer about death

2524
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:30,582
is that I just I'm done.

2525
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:32,918
I don't get to continue
learning things

2526
01:41:32,919 --> 01:41:34,486
and seeing what happens,

2527
01:41:34,487 --> 01:41:38,257
and I'm just not part
of Earth anymore.

2528
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:41,260
- Isn't death kind of what
gives you that passion

2529
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:42,461
when you think about it?

2530
01:41:42,462 --> 01:41:44,796
When you think about like, I
love learning, I love ideas.

2531
01:41:44,797 --> 01:41:46,665
If you didn't have an endpoint,

2532
01:41:46,666 --> 01:41:48,901
Are you gonna come in here
today with all these cameras

2533
01:41:48,902 --> 01:41:51,170
and do the huge
amount of legwork

2534
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:53,472
that creating a show requires?

2535
01:41:53,473 --> 01:41:54,306
- No.

2536
01:41:54,307 --> 01:41:55,441
- No, right?

2537
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:56,875
Because you're like, I don't
know, maybe I'll do it,

2538
01:41:56,876 --> 01:41:59,211
200 years from now,
whereas right now

2539
01:41:59,212 --> 01:42:01,246
you're taking in
information left and right,

2540
01:42:01,247 --> 01:42:02,581
because you wanna
produce content,

2541
01:42:02,582 --> 01:42:04,816
you wanna produce
exciting things

2542
01:42:04,817 --> 01:42:06,318
and share with other people.

2543
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:07,486
- Because this is my
one chance to do that.

2544
01:42:07,487 --> 01:42:10,756
- This is your one chance,
the passion and the realness

2545
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:13,492
to life comes from it ending.

2546
01:42:13,493 --> 01:42:15,761
That's the great gift
that death gives us.

2547
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:17,663
- What's an unhealthy
relationship

2548
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:19,665
to have to your own mortality?

2549
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:21,400
- The pursuit of immortality,

2550
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:23,669
and the pursuit of,
"I will stay alive

2551
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:26,872
"until I can upload my
brain into the cloud."

2552
01:42:26,873 --> 01:42:28,974
That worries me, the
idea that everyone

2553
01:42:28,975 --> 01:42:31,276
is just allowed to live forever,

2554
01:42:31,277 --> 01:42:34,846
from here on out, is not
environmentally sensible.

2555
01:42:34,847 --> 01:42:38,684
It's just not a sensible
position to take.

2556
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:42,921
(upbeat music_

2557
01:42:42,922 --> 01:42:45,791
- [Narrator] We are seeing
the dawn of a new era,

2558
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:49,394
of possibilities
unfold on planet Earth.

2559
01:42:49,395 --> 01:42:53,398
What more amazing will
be like in say 80, 100

2560
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:55,767
or even 200 years from now?

2561
01:42:55,768 --> 01:42:58,337
Wouldn't you like the
possibility of finding out?

2562
01:42:58,338 --> 01:42:59,838
(upbeat music)

2563
01:42:59,839 --> 01:43:02,341
- To understand why some
people feel like death

2564
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:05,377
shouldn't be inevitable.
I've come to Alcor,

2565
01:43:05,378 --> 01:43:07,946
one of the world's leading
life extension facilities.

2566
01:43:07,947 --> 01:43:08,780
Linda.

2567
01:43:08,781 --> 01:43:10,549
- Hi, how are you?

2568
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:11,717
- Great to meet you.

2569
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:13,318
- Nice to meet you too,
welcome down Alcor.

2570
01:43:13,319 --> 01:43:14,419
- Thank you for having me here.

2571
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:15,887
I'm meeting Linda Chamberlain,

2572
01:43:15,888 --> 01:43:18,991
who co founded Alcor
nearly 46 years ago.

2573
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:21,560
So this facility that
we are in right now

2574
01:43:21,561 --> 01:43:27,432
is where you both cryo
preserve people and store them.

2575
01:43:27,433 --> 01:43:29,835
- Yes, we have 160 patients.

2576
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:30,669
- Wow.

2577
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:34,606
- And we have 1190

2578
01:43:34,607 --> 01:43:37,743
something members, it changes.

2579
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:39,645
- A member is someone
who is alive today.

2580
01:43:39,646 --> 01:43:42,848
- Alive today, they've made
the arrangements for this.

2581
01:43:42,849 --> 01:43:46,652
Once they are cryo preserved,
they become patients.

2582
01:43:46,653 --> 01:43:48,353
- You're using the word patient.

2583
01:43:48,354 --> 01:43:49,621
- Yes.

2584
01:43:49,622 --> 01:43:51,290
- Okay, tell me about
why you use that word.

2585
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:53,292
- For us, death is not something

2586
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:55,294
which is like an on off switch.

2587
01:43:55,295 --> 01:43:58,697
One second, you're alive
the next second you're dead.

2588
01:43:58,698 --> 01:44:01,833
What we are trying
to do is to slow down

2589
01:44:01,834 --> 01:44:04,703
and stop the dying process.

2590
01:44:04,704 --> 01:44:06,538
- To become a patient at Alcor.

2591
01:44:06,539 --> 01:44:10,742
First you have to pay
between 80 and $200,000,

2592
01:44:10,743 --> 01:44:13,979
then you have to die
or more specifically

2593
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,315
be pronounced clinically dead.

2594
01:44:16,316 --> 01:44:18,517
This generally means
that your heart and lungs

2595
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:19,485
have stopped functioning.

2596
01:44:19,486 --> 01:44:22,621
At that point, Alcor
can begin their work.

2597
01:44:22,622 --> 01:44:24,623
- Now there are two
ways that a person

2598
01:44:24,624 --> 01:44:25,991
could sign up for
this procedure.

2599
01:44:25,992 --> 01:44:29,795
There's a whole body
patient or as a neuro

2600
01:44:29,796 --> 01:44:31,630
- Oh, and does neuro
just mean head?

2601
01:44:31,631 --> 01:44:33,899
- It means yes, the
cephalon actually,

2602
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:37,636
which is all the structures
down to about the clavicle.

2603
01:44:37,637 --> 01:44:41,006
I'm a neuro, everybody
in my family,

2604
01:44:41,007 --> 01:44:43,608
who's now in staces is a neuro.

2605
01:44:43,609 --> 01:44:46,011
Most of the people
who really understand

2606
01:44:46,012 --> 01:44:49,348
the technology are neuros.

2607
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:52,351
The primary reason that
people choose whole body

2608
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:53,552
is the emotional.

2609
01:44:53,553 --> 01:44:54,787
- Of course.

2610
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:58,390
- And they're not comfortable
with the idea of their body

2611
01:44:58,391 --> 01:45:00,859
being removed and discarded.

2612
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:04,996
So let's say that our
patient, is whole body,

2613
01:45:04,997 --> 01:45:07,699
the moment the
patient is pronounced,

2614
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,034
they go into an ice bath.

2615
01:45:09,035 --> 01:45:11,069
And this is just crushed ice,

2616
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:13,538
and its water in there as well.

2617
01:45:13,539 --> 01:45:16,708
Their heart is started again,
with a mechanical thumper,

2618
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:19,911
they're intubated and their
lungs are functioning again

2619
01:45:19,912 --> 01:45:23,882
being ventilated circulating
the cooler temperature.

2620
01:45:23,883 --> 01:45:25,617
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2621
01:45:25,618 --> 01:45:27,052
So you need the veins, the
arteries, the vasculature,

2622
01:45:27,053 --> 01:45:28,854
the heart, you need all of those

2623
01:45:28,855 --> 01:45:32,023
continuing to pump
and circulate.

2624
01:45:32,024 --> 01:45:35,026
- This is our operating room.

2625
01:45:35,027 --> 01:45:36,728
So basically,

2626
01:45:36,729 --> 01:45:39,798
when the patient comes in
through the door there,

2627
01:45:39,799 --> 01:45:44,002
they'll go into this specially
developed operating table,

2628
01:45:44,003 --> 01:45:49,875
it is going to be circulating
nitrogen gas over them

2629
01:45:49,876 --> 01:45:52,411
to help cool them externally.

2630
01:45:52,412 --> 01:45:54,646
And if its whole body patient,

2631
01:45:54,647 --> 01:45:57,549
then the surgeons open the chest

2632
01:45:57,550 --> 01:45:59,751
and then we begin circulating

2633
01:45:59,752 --> 01:46:02,554
the organ transplants solution.

2634
01:46:02,555 --> 01:46:03,688
- Once in the operating room,

2635
01:46:03,689 --> 01:46:05,123
the patient's blood is replaced

2636
01:46:05,124 --> 01:46:07,659
with cooled organ
transplant fluid

2637
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:09,728
and circulated through
the vascular system

2638
01:46:09,729 --> 01:46:11,630
to rapidly cool
down the internal

2639
01:46:11,631 --> 01:46:13,765
and external
temperatures of the body.

2640
01:46:13,766 --> 01:46:15,801
Now, just before the water
within the body tissue

2641
01:46:15,802 --> 01:46:17,636
reaches its freezing point.

2642
01:46:17,637 --> 01:46:20,439
Cryo protective
fluids are introduced.

2643
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:22,941
These act like anti freeze
preventing the formation

2644
01:46:22,942 --> 01:46:26,044
of ice crystals that
could damage soft tissue.

2645
01:46:26,045 --> 01:46:30,048
This is called the
vitrification process.

2646
01:46:30,049 --> 01:46:32,751
- Now let's say that
it is a neuro patient.

2647
01:46:32,752 --> 01:46:34,219
So they come in first here--

2648
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:35,420
- Yep their whole body.

2649
01:46:35,421 --> 01:46:38,723
- Right the surgeons will do
the neuro separation first.

2650
01:46:38,724 --> 01:46:39,658
- Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

2651
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:41,159
- To separate the cephalon,

2652
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,796
which is all of the structures
down to about the clavicle,

2653
01:46:44,797 --> 01:46:48,767
bring it over here to

2654
01:46:48,768 --> 01:46:52,237
this operating field.

2655
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:55,073
Wash the blood out
and we introduce

2656
01:46:55,074 --> 01:46:57,175
the organ transplant solution.

2657
01:46:57,176 --> 01:47:00,545
- I'm imagining a
person's cephalon

2658
01:47:00,546 --> 01:47:02,080
essentially their head in here,

2659
01:47:02,081 --> 01:47:05,650
I can see how it's
going to get clamped in.

2660
01:47:05,651 --> 01:47:08,787
That looks like I'm sure

2661
01:47:08,788 --> 01:47:11,857
a crazy sci fi movie,
but it really happens.

2662
01:47:11,858 --> 01:47:13,758
- It really happens.

2663
01:47:13,759 --> 01:47:15,861
- [Michael] After
the verification
process is complete.

2664
01:47:15,862 --> 01:47:18,029
The patients are
placed inside bags

2665
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:20,232
that are attached
to open metal cases,

2666
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:23,034
which are then placed
inside cylindrical tanks

2667
01:47:23,035 --> 01:47:26,104
filled with liquid
nitrogen called dewars.

2668
01:47:26,105 --> 01:47:28,039
- So this is our
patient care bay.

2669
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,742
We have 159 patients

2670
01:47:30,743 --> 01:47:31,943
- In these tanks right here.

2671
01:47:31,944 --> 01:47:34,279
- In these tanks.

2672
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:37,916
There are approximately
nine patients

2673
01:47:37,917 --> 01:47:43,288
and each one of these four
whole bodies and five neuros.

2674
01:47:43,289 --> 01:47:46,224
This one right here

2675
01:47:46,225 --> 01:47:49,528
is where my husband

2676
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:50,762
is currently housed.
- This one right here.

2677
01:47:50,763 --> 01:47:53,532
- Right, this is where
Fred is at the moment.

2678
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:57,569
My mother and my
father in law are

2679
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:59,938
in this one.

2680
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:04,576
- Wow, it's so weird
because I am right now,

2681
01:48:04,577 --> 01:48:06,778
not in a graveyard.
- No.

2682
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:10,148
Alcor is very much
like an ambulance

2683
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:13,852
taking their loved ones to a
hospital, not down the street.

2684
01:48:13,853 --> 01:48:16,254
that a hospital in the future,

2685
01:48:16,255 --> 01:48:18,857
when technology can help them.

2686
01:48:18,858 --> 01:48:20,625
- They're not being transported

2687
01:48:20,626 --> 01:48:23,662
through space but through time.

2688
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:24,763
(upbeat music)

2689
01:48:24,764 --> 01:48:27,065
To see what drives this
time traveling ambulance,

2690
01:48:27,066 --> 01:48:29,701
I'm going to sit
down with Max More,

2691
01:48:29,702 --> 01:48:33,705
Alcor's CEO and a
future neuro patient.

2692
01:48:33,706 --> 01:48:36,808
So Max, what's the status
of the technology needed

2693
01:48:36,809 --> 01:48:39,978
to revive cryo
preserve specimens?

2694
01:48:39,979 --> 01:48:40,979
Are we getting closer?

2695
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:42,614
- We are getting closer,

2696
01:48:42,615 --> 01:48:44,282
it's gonna be decades at
least before we can bring back

2697
01:48:44,283 --> 01:48:46,084
human beings,
whole human beings.

2698
01:48:46,085 --> 01:48:49,754
But we already cryo
preserved eggs, sperm,

2699
01:48:49,755 --> 01:48:51,823
we cryo preserved skin
corneas, heart valves,

2700
01:48:51,824 --> 01:48:53,024
all kinds of things.

2701
01:48:53,025 --> 01:48:55,860
So these are single tissues and
we can reverse that process.

2702
01:48:55,861 --> 01:48:57,662
Now you move from
that to an organ,

2703
01:48:57,663 --> 01:48:59,130
things get more difficult.

2704
01:48:59,131 --> 01:49:02,167
But we actually did an
experiment a few years ago

2705
01:49:02,168 --> 01:49:04,970
took this little tiny worm
we used certain chemicals,

2706
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:06,171
So it would learn that,

2707
01:49:06,172 --> 01:49:07,839
oh my foods over here
and not over here.

2708
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,709
And we cryo preserved them,
and then we just waited,

2709
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:12,043
brought them back and
then we tested them,

2710
01:49:12,044 --> 01:49:13,278
we were able to demonstrate

2711
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:15,614
that the memory
test that the ones

2712
01:49:15,615 --> 01:49:17,816
that had received the
training retained that memory.

2713
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:19,684
So it was the first
time in an organism

2714
01:49:19,685 --> 01:49:21,319
we've proven
survive with memory.

2715
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:23,922
So now we're asking, okay,
what's the next step?

2716
01:49:23,923 --> 01:49:26,124
Because whole organisms are
difficult to reverse right now,

2717
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:28,693
but step by step, the
more progress we can make,

2718
01:49:28,694 --> 01:49:29,995
the more convincing this is.

2719
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:32,697
- Now, when it comes
to extending life,

2720
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:36,968
some questions come up,
like should people die?

2721
01:49:36,969 --> 01:49:40,205
I know we don't like
the idea of death, but

2722
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:41,373
do we lose something?

2723
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:42,307
- I know what
you're getting at--

2724
01:49:42,308 --> 01:49:43,742
- By getting rid of death.

2725
01:49:43,743 --> 01:49:45,110
- Yeah, I think we
will lose something

2726
01:49:45,111 --> 01:49:47,746
like we lost something
when we got rid of slavery or
smallpox,

2727
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:51,850
So I think people,
people find themselves

2728
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:53,752
in knots to rationalize death.

2729
01:49:53,753 --> 01:49:54,986
I believe that.

2730
01:49:54,987 --> 01:49:56,721
Right now we're kind of
in this tragic situation

2731
01:49:56,722 --> 01:49:59,190
where over time, hopefully
you kind of learn

2732
01:49:59,191 --> 01:50:00,392
your wisdom grows over time,

2733
01:50:00,393 --> 01:50:01,493
but the same time your cognitive

2734
01:50:01,494 --> 01:50:05,030
and physical health is
declining, that's really sucks.

2735
01:50:05,031 --> 01:50:06,698
That's a bad situation.

2736
01:50:06,699 --> 01:50:07,932
What if they both could
keep going up indefinitely,

2737
01:50:07,933 --> 01:50:09,901
so you could live
hundreds of years

2738
01:50:09,902 --> 01:50:12,704
or longer and get smarter and
more knowledgeable and wiser,

2739
01:50:12,705 --> 01:50:15,206
and hopefully more mature,
and have more foresight,

2740
01:50:15,207 --> 01:50:16,374
because you got a much
longer planning horizon.

2741
01:50:16,375 --> 01:50:20,178
What we'll have is a world
of like ultra mature people,

2742
01:50:20,179 --> 01:50:21,813
which I think will
actually be a better world

2743
01:50:21,814 --> 01:50:22,914
than the one we have today.

2744
01:50:22,915 --> 01:50:24,349
And if they say well,

2745
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:25,950
and it just comes up
all the time, they say,

2746
01:50:25,951 --> 01:50:27,886
well, death is what
gives life meaning.

2747
01:50:27,887 --> 01:50:29,387
Bullshit.

2748
01:50:29,388 --> 01:50:32,691
If that was true, then would
they also advocate people

2749
01:50:32,692 --> 01:50:35,026
who live to 90 should
be killed off at 45,

2750
01:50:35,027 --> 01:50:36,428
will that double the
meaning of their life?

2751
01:50:36,429 --> 01:50:38,830
In fact, I think life
gets more meaning,

2752
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:40,799
the longer you live,
because you can build

2753
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,833
on what you've done before.

2754
01:50:41,834 --> 01:50:43,868
So if anything it increases

2755
01:50:43,869 --> 01:50:45,737
the meaningfulness
of life, my view.

2756
01:50:45,738 --> 01:50:47,972
- You're making me
realize that in many ways,

2757
01:50:47,973 --> 01:50:49,741
I

2758
01:50:49,742 --> 01:50:52,744
am rationalizing death.

2759
01:50:52,745 --> 01:50:56,114
I'm looking for ways to
excuse it and accept it.

2760
01:50:56,115 --> 01:50:59,350
I don't think it's unhealthy
to accept that you are mortal.

2761
01:50:59,351 --> 01:51:00,852
- Well, I have to accept it

2762
01:51:00,853 --> 01:51:02,387
because I could get
killed at any time.

2763
01:51:02,388 --> 01:51:05,857
One thing I'm have to stress
because every article written

2764
01:51:05,858 --> 01:51:08,793
they always have to use the
word forever, or immortality.

2765
01:51:08,794 --> 01:51:09,894
And that's not on
the table here.

2766
01:51:09,895 --> 01:51:12,397
We're just offering a
chance people to be revived

2767
01:51:12,398 --> 01:51:14,232
in the time when
we've beaten aging.

2768
01:51:14,233 --> 01:51:15,734
But eventually
something's gonna get you

2769
01:51:15,735 --> 01:51:17,235
so we're not
offering immortality,

2770
01:51:17,236 --> 01:51:20,371
we're offering an unknown
extension of human lifespan.

2771
01:51:20,372 --> 01:51:23,341
(upbeat music)

2772
01:51:23,342 --> 01:51:26,044
- Okay, so, Elisabeth,
welcome back.

2773
01:51:26,045 --> 01:51:26,878
- Thanks.

2774
01:51:26,879 --> 01:51:30,915
- Pretty heavy stuff.

2775
01:51:30,916 --> 01:51:33,284
You have a connection to Alcor.

2776
01:51:33,285 --> 01:51:39,157
In fact, you were the one
who got us that interview.

2777
01:51:39,158 --> 01:51:40,391
- Yeah, I set up the visit.

2778
01:51:40,392 --> 01:51:44,763
- So how did you come
into contact with Alcor?

2779
01:51:44,764 --> 01:51:48,833
- Well, I grew up in near San
Francisco in the Bay Area.

2780
01:51:48,834 --> 01:51:53,304
So I think Alcor has always
been in my consciousness,

2781
01:51:53,305 --> 01:51:54,773
and my awareness
since I was a kid.

2782
01:51:54,774 --> 01:51:57,208
I was familiar with
the philosophy of it.

2783
01:51:57,209 --> 01:52:01,846
And I probably have a dozen
friends or so who are members.

2784
01:52:01,847 --> 01:52:03,148
- I think you even are friends

2785
01:52:03,149 --> 01:52:06,985
with the couple on the
brochure about Alcor.

2786
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:07,986
- That's right.
- That people get.

2787
01:52:07,987 --> 01:52:09,854
- And Max is a friend as well.

2788
01:52:09,855 --> 01:52:11,289
- Right.
- Yeah, the CEO.

2789
01:52:11,290 --> 01:52:14,425
- So I guess the next
question is, are you a member?

2790
01:52:14,426 --> 01:52:17,862
- I'm not a member yet, but
I intend to be at some point.

2791
01:52:17,863 --> 01:52:19,898
- So what's keeping you
from doing it the cost?

2792
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:21,299
- It's just the cost right now,

2793
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:24,068
Yeah, that's it, and also
the fact that honestly,

2794
01:52:24,069 --> 01:52:25,303
if I were to die right now,

2795
01:52:25,304 --> 01:52:29,274
the chance of
being cryogenically
frozen is pretty low

2796
01:52:29,275 --> 01:52:31,810
because the way I would
die would probably

2797
01:52:31,811 --> 01:52:35,814
be in a motorbike accident in
India or something like that.

2798
01:52:35,815 --> 01:52:37,849
So it'd be hard to
get this cephalon

2799
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,450
back to the Alcor lab in time.

2800
01:52:39,451 --> 01:52:41,352
- Yep, the best.

2801
01:52:41,353 --> 01:52:43,988
It's weird to talk about
this the best way to die,

2802
01:52:43,989 --> 01:52:48,827
to be cryogenically
frozen is to die,

2803
01:52:48,828 --> 01:52:52,096
right there near their facility.

2804
01:52:52,097 --> 01:52:54,232
I think they've said that
they have a lot of members

2805
01:52:54,233 --> 01:53:00,004
who near the end of their life
move to the Scottsdale area,

2806
01:53:00,005 --> 01:53:01,239
so that when they die,

2807
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:03,908
they can be taken
right away or actually,

2808
01:53:03,909 --> 01:53:08,546
an Alcor team can
be at your deathbed.

2809
01:53:08,547 --> 01:53:10,615
Now, the best way to be frozen.

2810
01:53:10,616 --> 01:53:13,885
And this is kind of
what makes me feel

2811
01:53:13,886 --> 01:53:15,253
like we have a long way to go,

2812
01:53:15,254 --> 01:53:18,489
is that the best way
for me to be cryo frozen

2813
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:20,124
and then brought back
later is for someone

2814
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:24,529
to literally kill me right now.

2815
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:27,232
Stick me in the ice bath
right now start pumping in

2816
01:53:27,233 --> 01:53:31,502
the fluid to cool my body down
and kill me by cooling me.

2817
01:53:31,503 --> 01:53:33,104
If I die in any other way,

2818
01:53:33,105 --> 01:53:34,973
there will be too
much cell death

2819
01:53:34,974 --> 01:53:36,541
or at least there will be some,

2820
01:53:36,542 --> 01:53:38,543
because for a split second,

2821
01:53:38,544 --> 01:53:43,047
while the law decides
whether I'm dead or not,

2822
01:53:43,048 --> 01:53:44,549
my cells are already dying.

2823
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:45,884
- Right yeah.

2824
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:47,886
And also, I suppose
by that logic,

2825
01:53:47,887 --> 01:53:49,087
you would also wanna do it

2826
01:53:49,088 --> 01:53:50,455
as early in your
life as possible,

2827
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:52,523
when your brain is in
the best possible state.

2828
01:53:52,524 --> 01:53:55,326
- Exactly, I wonder if
they've ever had a member say,

2829
01:53:55,327 --> 01:53:58,663
all right, I have
cognitive decline.

2830
01:53:58,664 --> 01:54:02,300
And it's happening to
the tissues in my brain.

2831
01:54:02,301 --> 01:54:05,637
If you preserve me when I
finally am pronounced dead

2832
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:09,574
by an authority, what
brain will I have left?

2833
01:54:09,575 --> 01:54:12,076
That's what I'm stuck with.

2834
01:54:12,077 --> 01:54:14,345
They may believe
that in the future,

2835
01:54:14,346 --> 01:54:17,048
we can just reconstruct
an entire consciousness

2836
01:54:17,049 --> 01:54:18,516
by just knowing a little bit

2837
01:54:18,517 --> 01:54:21,286
about some of the brain
connections and structures,

2838
01:54:21,287 --> 01:54:23,221
but I guess all of
this brings us to

2839
01:54:23,222 --> 01:54:24,555
what Caitlin was saying,

2840
01:54:24,556 --> 01:54:28,059
she really was uncomfortable
with that idea.

2841
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:31,429
That it seems what
were her words?

2842
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:33,464
Non sensible.

2843
01:54:33,465 --> 01:54:34,599
- Well, I think living forever

2844
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:37,168
immortality is
pretty nonsensical.

2845
01:54:37,169 --> 01:54:39,537
And even Alcor will
say and even Max says

2846
01:54:39,538 --> 01:54:45,710
that what they're striving
for is not immortality.

2847
01:54:45,711 --> 01:54:47,846
It's just extending
the life that we have.

2848
01:54:47,847 --> 01:54:49,647
And there's many ways
that we do that already.

2849
01:54:49,648 --> 01:54:53,084
We have antibiotics
and vaccinations and
things like that.

2850
01:54:53,085 --> 01:54:55,653
- Right, just wearing a seatbelt

2851
01:54:55,654 --> 01:54:59,457
is a life extension protocol.

2852
01:54:59,458 --> 01:55:01,526
What Alcor does,

2853
01:55:01,527 --> 01:55:04,529
seems much more sci fi.

2854
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:07,966
And, I also understand
a lot of the criticisms

2855
01:55:07,967 --> 01:55:10,201
around the cost,

2856
01:55:10,202 --> 01:55:12,704
the cost filters out

2857
01:55:12,705 --> 01:55:18,443
only a certain kind of
person to be preserved.

2858
01:55:18,444 --> 01:55:21,612
If we can bring back frozen
people in the future,

2859
01:55:21,613 --> 01:55:25,984
those from now in history
will predominantly be high.

2860
01:55:25,985 --> 01:55:28,653
I'm a Silicon Valley
millionaire or billionaire.

2861
01:55:28,654 --> 01:55:31,322
And I'm back and now it's
the year 8000, and I'm back.

2862
01:55:31,323 --> 01:55:33,591
- Right and certain
personality traits--

2863
01:55:33,592 --> 01:55:34,759
- [Michael] Only
personality traits?

2864
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,361
- Yeah.

2865
01:55:36,362 --> 01:55:40,331
- Yeah, so is that possibly
not gonna represent

2866
01:55:40,332 --> 01:55:42,066
our arrow well in the future,

2867
01:55:42,067 --> 01:55:46,738
if only those with the
means to extend their life

2868
01:55:46,739 --> 01:55:49,007
in that way, do so.

2869
01:55:49,008 --> 01:55:50,608
- And the other thing
that goes along with that

2870
01:55:50,609 --> 01:55:53,444
is I think that people
who have abundance

2871
01:55:53,445 --> 01:55:55,546
are also more likely to
want to extend their life,

2872
01:55:55,547 --> 01:55:57,181
not just because they can,

2873
01:55:57,182 --> 01:55:59,350
but because they're
living a good life.

2874
01:55:59,351 --> 01:56:01,652
And so Alcor is not, I
mean at least for me,

2875
01:56:01,653 --> 01:56:03,021
it's not about denying death,

2876
01:56:03,022 --> 01:56:05,356
it's not because I'm
terrified of dying.

2877
01:56:05,357 --> 01:56:07,558
It's because I
actually love life.

2878
01:56:07,559 --> 01:56:09,727
I enjoy every moment of it.

2879
01:56:09,728 --> 01:56:12,630
And the only tragedy is,
like you said that I won't,

2880
01:56:12,631 --> 01:56:14,665
at some point, I won't
be able to keep learning,

2881
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:16,200
I won't be able to keep growing,

2882
01:56:16,201 --> 01:56:19,137
I won't be able to keep
discovering new things.

2883
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:23,274
So people who enjoy life who
have the fortune of being able

2884
01:56:23,275 --> 01:56:28,446
to do all of that naturally
want that to continue.

2885
01:56:28,447 --> 01:56:34,585
- Now I get some of the
reactions people have like,

2886
01:56:34,586 --> 01:56:36,654
well, but it's not
environmentally sensible.

2887
01:56:36,655 --> 01:56:39,791
And we only have a finite
amount of resources,

2888
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:44,095
I get all of that, I hope that
that ceases to be a problem.

2889
01:56:44,096 --> 01:56:47,565
I think more human
lives is just better.

2890
01:56:47,566 --> 01:56:51,602
And to think any other
way is ridiculous.

2891
01:56:51,603 --> 01:56:57,208
We need to make sure we can
sustain all of those lives

2892
01:56:57,209 --> 01:56:59,544
and give people good lives--

2893
01:56:59,545 --> 01:57:01,746
- And that could take
us about overpopulation.

2894
01:57:01,747 --> 01:57:03,414
- Is what I'm saying, yeah.

2895
01:57:03,415 --> 01:57:07,418
I feel like any negative side
effects of overpopulation

2896
01:57:07,419 --> 01:57:09,620
could be fixed by the time
we're also able to literally

2897
01:57:09,621 --> 01:57:11,522
bring back a frozen brain.

2898
01:57:11,523 --> 01:57:15,159
Okay, we should be
working on both.

2899
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,761
But I'm basically throwing
that off the table,

2900
01:57:16,762 --> 01:57:18,496
because I don't really care.

2901
01:57:18,497 --> 01:57:19,730
I think it's not going to
be an issue in the future,

2902
01:57:19,731 --> 01:57:22,133
so long as we keep
focusing on it,

2903
01:57:22,134 --> 01:57:23,468
problems of overpopulation.

2904
01:57:23,469 --> 01:57:25,336
Well, we need humans to die,

2905
01:57:25,337 --> 01:57:27,305
or else we're not gonna have
enough beef for everyone,

2906
01:57:27,306 --> 01:57:29,407
and it's like, all
right, let's fix that.

2907
01:57:29,408 --> 01:57:31,676
But assuming that that's fixed,

2908
01:57:31,677 --> 01:57:35,246
I still feel like there's

2909
01:57:35,247 --> 01:57:36,614
a kind of hubris
that turns me off

2910
01:57:36,615 --> 01:57:41,185
to the idea of extending
your life like this.

2911
01:57:41,186 --> 01:57:46,524
Why do you think that you
get to live longer in this?

2912
01:57:46,525 --> 01:57:50,161
I hate to say artificial because
seat belts are artificial,

2913
01:57:50,162 --> 01:57:52,630
they're technology we
invented to make us not die

2914
01:57:52,631 --> 01:57:54,265
so often and quickly.

2915
01:57:54,266 --> 01:57:56,300
- Yeah, yeah, I get what
you're saying I mean,

2916
01:57:56,301 --> 01:57:58,836
it does feel kind of self
indulgent, to be able to say,

2917
01:57:58,837 --> 01:58:00,538
Here I am, I'm so special,

2918
01:58:00,539 --> 01:58:03,374
I get to be one of the few
that survived in the future.

2919
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:05,610
And I guess my counter
argument to that is whenever,

2920
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:07,545
with any new technology,

2921
01:58:07,546 --> 01:58:11,616
it's always initially only
limited to a subset of people

2922
01:58:11,617 --> 01:58:15,586
who are risk takers,
early adopters,

2923
01:58:15,587 --> 01:58:17,488
who have the financial
means to do it,

2924
01:58:17,489 --> 01:58:18,823
who have the sort of foresight

2925
01:58:18,824 --> 01:58:22,460
or sort of long term perspective

2926
01:58:22,461 --> 01:58:24,495
to wanna do that
in the first place.

2927
01:58:24,496 --> 01:58:27,498
And just because that's a
small set of the population

2928
01:58:27,499 --> 01:58:29,267
doesn't mean that those
people shouldn't do it.

2929
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:30,768
In fact, on the contrary,

2930
01:58:30,769 --> 01:58:35,506
that's the first step to making
it accessible to everyone.

2931
01:58:35,507 --> 01:58:37,441
- I brought up a point to Max

2932
01:58:37,442 --> 01:58:39,644
that I think is in
the bonus footage,

2933
01:58:39,645 --> 01:58:43,548
but didn't make it into the
episode about social progress.

2934
01:58:43,549 --> 01:58:46,484
And how if we wind
up with five, six,

2935
01:58:46,485 --> 01:58:49,820
700 year old, super
mature people,

2936
01:58:49,821 --> 01:58:53,858
what if their ideas about
the way society is organized,

2937
01:58:53,859 --> 01:58:58,196
doesn't change, and we
wind up getting stuck,

2938
01:58:58,197 --> 01:59:00,331
not making progress,

2939
01:59:00,332 --> 01:59:02,600
because the population
wants to keep living

2940
01:59:02,601 --> 01:59:05,636
the way they lived in their 20s,

2941
01:59:05,637 --> 01:59:10,675
which, in 600 years
might not be the way.

2942
01:59:10,676 --> 01:59:12,443
Which I don't think
any system right now

2943
01:59:12,444 --> 01:59:13,678
is the best system.

2944
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:16,414
But if we start having
people not die out,

2945
01:59:16,415 --> 01:59:19,383
does that mean that we
stopped making progress?

2946
01:59:19,384 --> 01:59:20,718
It's a weird argument.

2947
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:21,919
Max then points out.

2948
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:23,621
So what are you
recommending we do,

2949
01:59:23,622 --> 01:59:25,523
genocide people
when they're old?

2950
01:59:25,524 --> 01:59:28,259
I'm like, no, not that.

2951
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:28,859
What do you think?

2952
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:29,760
Am I making sense here?

2953
01:59:29,761 --> 01:59:31,262
- Yeah, definitely.

2954
01:59:31,263 --> 01:59:33,297
I mean, I think that the brain

2955
01:59:33,298 --> 01:59:35,866
does tend to become
sort of ossified.

2956
01:59:35,867 --> 01:59:39,303
As we get older, people tend
to be more conservative,

2957
01:59:39,304 --> 01:59:42,740
more traditional, be
more set in the routines.

2958
01:59:42,741 --> 01:59:45,943
But I think by the time
we have the technology to,

2959
01:59:45,944 --> 01:59:49,680
and cryonically free
somebody and revive somebody

2960
01:59:49,681 --> 01:59:54,285
we'll also have age
technologies to make the brain

2961
01:59:54,286 --> 01:59:56,587
more flexible again and reverse

2962
01:59:56,588 --> 01:59:59,423
the aging process in the brain.

2963
01:59:59,424 --> 02:00:03,694
So it might not actually
be an issue anymore.

2964
02:00:03,695 --> 02:00:06,397
And the other counter
arguments I have to that is,

2965
02:00:06,398 --> 02:00:08,633
okay so maybe that is true.

2966
02:00:08,634 --> 02:00:11,502
But let's see how it plays out.

2967
02:00:11,503 --> 02:00:13,671
We're still gonna be
having children, right.

2968
02:00:13,672 --> 02:00:16,574
And so there are still
gonna be fresh ideas,

2969
02:00:16,575 --> 02:00:18,643
new generations, the
generational dynamic

2970
02:00:18,644 --> 02:00:20,478
is gonna be very different.

2971
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:23,614
Because it won't just be
boomers versus millennials.

2972
02:00:23,615 --> 02:00:25,316
(laughing)

2973
02:00:25,317 --> 02:00:27,485
- Yeah, there will be like
four or five generations

2974
02:00:27,486 --> 02:00:28,986
around to be battling it out.

2975
02:00:28,987 --> 02:00:31,622
There will be 20,

2976
02:00:31,623 --> 02:00:32,723
30.

2977
02:00:32,724 --> 02:00:36,661
And man, we will learn so much.

2978
02:00:36,662 --> 02:00:41,332
I think a lot of that fear
you have as you get older

2979
02:00:41,333 --> 02:00:45,770
about things changing is an
evolutionarily designed process

2980
02:00:45,771 --> 02:00:48,639
of like, Look, I lived
long enough to reproduce,

2981
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,375
therefore, the way I was
raised must be good enough.

2982
02:00:51,376 --> 02:00:53,944
anything different could risk
that not happening again.

2983
02:00:53,945 --> 02:00:56,647
So of course natural
selection will choose people

2984
02:00:56,648 --> 02:00:59,517
who have developed a mind
that doesn't like things

2985
02:00:59,518 --> 02:01:01,786
to change, it doesn't want
the kids be too different,

2986
02:01:01,787 --> 02:01:05,022
but imagine living
to be 600 years old,

2987
02:01:05,023 --> 02:01:08,492
and you see so many
generations of kids

2988
02:01:08,493 --> 02:01:09,827
that like different
kinds of music

2989
02:01:09,828 --> 02:01:11,429
and do different
kinds of hobbies

2990
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:14,098
and things and they're all okay.

2991
02:01:14,099 --> 02:01:15,933
- Yeah, think about
how much wisdom

2992
02:01:15,934 --> 02:01:18,436
you'd have after 600 years.

2993
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:20,738
- I think what we should do
now is go back to the episode

2994
02:01:20,739 --> 02:01:23,641
and look at the
decision that I make.

2995
02:01:23,642 --> 02:01:29,747
(upbeat music)

2996
02:01:29,748 --> 02:01:32,350
Do I think that
someday we will be able

2997
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:38,622
to cryonically freeze an entire
person and then revive them?

2998
02:01:38,623 --> 02:01:39,857
Yes, I do.

2999
02:01:39,858 --> 02:01:42,026
I believe that cryo preservation

3000
02:01:42,027 --> 02:01:45,996
will change the meaning of
death, and lead to breakthroughs

3001
02:01:45,997 --> 02:01:50,034
and medical technology that
will improve all of our lives.

3002
02:01:50,035 --> 02:01:52,069
But do I

3003
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:54,638
want to extend my
life indefinitely?

3004
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:59,043
Well, on the one hand,
obviously, death is a bummer.

3005
02:01:59,044 --> 02:02:02,446
But on the other, the
universe managed fine

3006
02:02:02,447 --> 02:02:05,750
without me for
billions of years.

3007
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:07,818
Am I really so important

3008
02:02:07,819 --> 02:02:10,721
that it should never
not have me again?

3009
02:02:10,722 --> 02:02:14,425
Should I be around
as long as possible?

3010
02:02:14,426 --> 02:02:19,530
Or do those who will come
later deserve their own world?

3011
02:02:19,531 --> 02:02:23,434
Should I try to extend my life?

3012
02:02:23,435 --> 02:02:26,504
Or should I decide to die

3013
02:02:26,505 --> 02:02:29,774
when my time comes and
return all this matter

3014
02:02:29,775 --> 02:02:32,476
I'm borrowing back to the world?

3015
02:02:32,477 --> 02:02:34,111
Well I don't think
there's a right answer.

3016
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:37,648
It's a personal choice
we each get to make

3017
02:02:37,649 --> 02:02:39,550
and should be able to make.

3018
02:02:39,551 --> 02:02:42,653
And I've been thinking
about it a lot.

3019
02:02:42,654 --> 02:02:46,857
(upbeat music)

3020
02:02:46,858 --> 02:02:49,560
So I'm going to speak again
with my friend Caitlin

3021
02:02:49,561 --> 02:02:52,997
the mortician to confront
my own mortality.

3022
02:02:52,998 --> 02:02:55,499
Well, Caitlin, Thanks for
meeting with me again.

3023
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:58,202
I've been surrounded by
death lately, spoke to you.

3024
02:02:58,203 --> 02:03:01,772
I visited Alcor and,

3025
02:03:01,773 --> 02:03:04,141
if we never invented
technology to bring people back

3026
02:03:04,142 --> 02:03:06,644
then the Alcor
patients are dead.

3027
02:03:06,645 --> 02:03:09,213
But they have that hope.

3028
02:03:09,214 --> 02:03:12,016
I worked on Terror
Management Theory.

3029
02:03:12,017 --> 02:03:15,619
And I even had a loved one
pass away just two weeks ago,

3030
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:16,620
my grandmother.

3031
02:03:16,621 --> 02:03:18,789
- I'm sorry to hear that.

3032
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:21,725
- She was cremated,
as well as my father.

3033
02:03:21,726 --> 02:03:24,795
And I realized,

3034
02:03:24,796 --> 02:03:26,564
I've never made a clear decision

3035
02:03:26,565 --> 02:03:30,234
about what should happen to me.

3036
02:03:30,235 --> 02:03:32,937
Because I just figured I'll
figure that out when I'm older,

3037
02:03:32,938 --> 02:03:34,505
but I could die at any time.

3038
02:03:34,506 --> 02:03:35,773
- You sure could.

3039
02:03:35,774 --> 02:03:39,777
- So I wanna be prepared, and
I want my wishes to be known.

3040
02:03:39,778 --> 02:03:43,147
So I've decided, when
that moment comes,

3041
02:03:43,148 --> 02:03:46,984
I want it to be my final
moment of existence,

3042
02:03:46,985 --> 02:03:49,253
I wanna give all my
atoms and molecules

3043
02:03:49,254 --> 02:03:53,824
back to the universe, and I've
decided that I want to die.

3044
02:03:53,825 --> 02:03:55,693
- I'm so glad you've
made that decision.

3045
02:03:55,694 --> 02:03:56,961
And you've come to
the right place.

3046
02:03:56,962 --> 02:03:59,697
- I want to be

3047
02:03:59,698 --> 02:04:02,600
naturally buried, I wanna
have a green burial,

3048
02:04:02,601 --> 02:04:05,002
become worm food and plant food

3049
02:04:05,003 --> 02:04:07,705
and I want it all
to go back to Earth.

3050
02:04:07,706 --> 02:04:13,577
But I kind of want a place where
people can come to be like,

3051
02:04:13,578 --> 02:04:14,778
that's where he was buried.

3052
02:04:14,779 --> 02:04:20,985
- So there's everything from
just little discs in the ground

3053
02:04:20,986 --> 02:04:24,522
where you are, to GPS
that locates you to
natural cemeteries

3054
02:04:24,523 --> 02:04:26,724
that are trying to
reintroduce native plants.

3055
02:04:26,725 --> 02:04:27,892
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3056
02:04:27,893 --> 02:04:29,760
- So you can have
your own Joshua Tree.

3057
02:04:29,761 --> 02:04:33,030
So the first thing I'm gonna
give you to give a look over

3058
02:04:33,031 --> 02:04:35,533
is what's called an
advanced directive.

3059
02:04:35,534 --> 02:04:38,035
And everybody needs
to have one of these.

3060
02:04:38,036 --> 02:04:42,039
And why it's so important
is that it's you,

3061
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:45,609
not only designating someone
to be in charge of your body

3062
02:04:45,610 --> 02:04:47,945
as you're dying,
right after you die,

3063
02:04:47,946 --> 02:04:50,714
and then with however you
decide to dispose of it,

3064
02:04:50,715 --> 02:04:52,683
but also who that person is.

3065
02:04:52,684 --> 02:04:55,119
- So this isn't just about
burial, this is dying.

3066
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:57,755
- Oh, no, it's about
death dying death

3067
02:04:57,756 --> 02:04:59,990
and after death.
- Interesting.

3068
02:04:59,991 --> 02:05:03,193
A choice like this is
extremely new to humans.

3069
02:05:03,194 --> 02:05:05,195
It used to be that
your only options

3070
02:05:05,196 --> 02:05:10,134
upon death were cremation,
embalming or rotting away.

3071
02:05:10,135 --> 02:05:12,836
But today, you can
choose to pause yourself

3072
02:05:12,837 --> 02:05:14,972
at death's door until the door

3073
02:05:14,973 --> 02:05:17,575
has been moved somewhere else.

3074
02:05:17,576 --> 02:05:20,110
But I've decided not to do that.

3075
02:05:20,111 --> 02:05:21,946
So I'm ready to
make this official.

3076
02:05:21,947 --> 02:05:23,948
- Fire in the hole.
- Okay.

3077
02:05:23,949 --> 02:05:27,751
(upbeat music)

3078
02:05:27,752 --> 02:05:30,020
- Whoa, all right.
- How do you feel?

3079
02:05:30,021 --> 02:05:32,256
- Weirdly, I feel
very relaxed and good.

3080
02:05:32,257 --> 02:05:33,991
It was kind of life changing,

3081
02:05:33,992 --> 02:05:36,093
but what it really was
was death changing.

3082
02:05:36,094 --> 02:05:37,294
- Huh, well, thank you,

3083
02:05:37,295 --> 02:05:39,229
and I'm glad you've
decided to die.

3084
02:05:39,230 --> 02:05:40,964
- Thank you.

3085
02:05:40,965 --> 02:05:43,367
Jeff and Sheldon, thank
you for showing me

3086
02:05:43,368 --> 02:05:45,669
the power of death's influence.

3087
02:05:45,670 --> 02:05:48,706
Caitlin, thank you for
helping me accept it.

3088
02:05:48,707 --> 02:05:50,708
Max, thank you for
the work you are doing

3089
02:05:50,709 --> 02:05:52,776
and the opportunities you
are offering humanity.

3090
02:05:52,777 --> 02:05:55,312
And all of you out there,

3091
02:05:55,313 --> 02:05:58,882
as always, thanks for watching.

3092
02:05:58,883 --> 02:06:01,218
All right, Elisabeth,

3093
02:06:01,219 --> 02:06:03,053
I decided

3094
02:06:03,054 --> 02:06:05,255
and still believe

3095
02:06:05,256 --> 02:06:07,825
I should die.

3096
02:06:07,826 --> 02:06:09,159
- You're still happy
with that decision?

3097
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:10,828
- I'm still happy
with that decision.

3098
02:06:10,829 --> 02:06:14,031
And I'm really happy for you
to make whatever decision

3099
02:06:14,032 --> 02:06:17,768
you want about yourself,

3100
02:06:17,769 --> 02:06:19,003
you're you, you own you.

3101
02:06:19,004 --> 02:06:22,072
So I don't care what
people decide to do.

3102
02:06:22,073 --> 02:06:25,676
I just I don't know,

3103
02:06:25,677 --> 02:06:29,813
the main part was that
I just feel like I

3104
02:06:29,814 --> 02:06:31,882
want one turn

3105
02:06:31,883 --> 02:06:33,917
at this game.

3106
02:06:33,918 --> 02:06:36,086
And I don't wanna
be around forever,

3107
02:06:36,087 --> 02:06:39,289
being like, well, I'm
older than you, so.

3108
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:42,292
But I also don't feel
like I can criticize

3109
02:06:42,293 --> 02:06:48,065
other people's
decisions about this.

3110
02:06:48,066 --> 02:06:49,166
I don't know, what do you think?

3111
02:06:49,167 --> 02:06:50,401
- I think it's interesting.

3112
02:06:50,402 --> 02:06:52,236
When people talk
about immortality,

3113
02:06:52,237 --> 02:06:53,871
they always think
of it in terms of

3114
02:06:53,872 --> 02:06:56,106
there's some sort of
costs that comes with it.

3115
02:06:56,107 --> 02:06:57,908
Like, there's no way that
you could have something

3116
02:06:57,909 --> 02:06:59,677
so wonderful as life extension

3117
02:06:59,678 --> 02:07:01,345
without some sort of drawback.

3118
02:07:01,346 --> 02:07:05,182
And all this sort of
fantasy and sci fi about it

3119
02:07:05,183 --> 02:07:06,750
even stories about vampires.

3120
02:07:06,751 --> 02:07:07,951
There's always like,

3121
02:07:07,952 --> 02:07:11,288
it comes with some sort
of terrible burden.

3122
02:07:11,289 --> 02:07:12,723
And

3123
02:07:12,724 --> 02:07:14,324
why?

3124
02:07:14,325 --> 02:07:17,194
That's just something that
we culturally have created,

3125
02:07:17,195 --> 02:07:19,063
doesn't necessarily
have to be the case.

3126
02:07:19,064 --> 02:07:23,267
And I

3127
02:07:23,268 --> 02:07:25,402
I'm perfectly inclined to think

3128
02:07:25,403 --> 02:07:28,038
that we can extend our
lives it probably be,

3129
02:07:28,039 --> 02:07:29,840
won't be like an all
of a sudden we find

3130
02:07:29,841 --> 02:07:32,076
some sort of magic drink that
we're gonna live forever.

3131
02:07:32,077 --> 02:07:34,712
Instead, it's gonna be a
very incremental process

3132
02:07:34,713 --> 02:07:38,182
of first it's gonna be
normal to live 100 years

3133
02:07:38,183 --> 02:07:42,786
and then 110 years, and 120
years and hundred like that.

3134
02:07:42,787 --> 02:07:46,223
And, yeah, probably
without some kind of crazy

3135
02:07:46,224 --> 02:07:48,058
cause for not gonna
be some abomination

3136
02:07:48,059 --> 02:07:50,928
or freak of nature or
something like that.

3137
02:07:50,929 --> 02:07:53,897
- Yeah, I think it
is really important

3138
02:07:53,898 --> 02:07:57,167
the points that
you've made about,

3139
02:07:57,168 --> 02:08:00,003
we're not talking about a
drink that makes you immortal,

3140
02:08:00,004 --> 02:08:03,874
like a vampire in
that sense of whoo,

3141
02:08:03,875 --> 02:08:07,911
but to strive for immortality
is something against God.

3142
02:08:07,912 --> 02:08:10,848
talking more about
extending life,

3143
02:08:10,849 --> 02:08:12,082
you could still get hit by a bus

3144
02:08:12,083 --> 02:08:15,219
at any time and
literally be dead.

3145
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:17,421
Your brains connections
are completely lost,

3146
02:08:17,422 --> 02:08:20,090
and we can never recreate them.

3147
02:08:20,091 --> 02:08:22,259
That's why I think that
what Alcor is doing,

3148
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:24,762
to help us understand
how to preserve tissues

3149
02:08:24,763 --> 02:08:28,465
and extend people's
lives is so important.

3150
02:08:28,466 --> 02:08:32,903
If a drink was invented,
that allowed one to stay

3151
02:08:32,904 --> 02:08:36,240
exactly as healthy
mentally, and physically

3152
02:08:36,241 --> 02:08:41,945
as they were that moment they
drank it, I wouldn't drink it.

3153
02:08:41,946 --> 02:08:44,982
Because again,

3154
02:08:44,983 --> 02:08:49,553
I want my song to
have a final note.

3155
02:08:49,554 --> 02:08:50,988
I don't like the end being

3156
02:08:50,989 --> 02:08:53,824
kind of like punted
down the road.

3157
02:08:53,825 --> 02:08:55,826
- I wonder if people would
have said the same thing

3158
02:08:55,827 --> 02:08:58,295
back, before antibiotics,

3159
02:08:58,296 --> 02:08:59,797
if they were looking
at the horizon,

3160
02:08:59,798 --> 02:09:03,133
and somebody described
to them, antibiotics

3161
02:09:03,134 --> 02:09:05,435
and this could extend
your life by 40 years

3162
02:09:05,436 --> 02:09:06,837
and this ear infection you have

3163
02:09:06,838 --> 02:09:09,206
doesn't have to cripple
you and kill you.

3164
02:09:09,207 --> 02:09:10,841
- Right, right.

3165
02:09:10,842 --> 02:09:12,876
Well, I mean, but I would
still say the same thing today.

3166
02:09:12,877 --> 02:09:15,879
If someone said, okay, you're
gonna die like in a week,

3167
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:18,549
unless you take this
medicine, I'll be like, sure.

3168
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:20,551
I don't know if I'm
just feeling like

3169
02:09:20,552 --> 02:09:24,188
there is like a
right time to die.

3170
02:09:24,189 --> 02:09:28,525
Like, the way it's sort of been.

3171
02:09:28,526 --> 02:09:34,531
When it's time your family
can move on and you've

3172
02:09:34,532 --> 02:09:37,835
led the way and now it's time
for them to lead the next

3173
02:09:37,836 --> 02:09:39,603
and everyone gets a
turn as the leader.

3174
02:09:39,604 --> 02:09:42,873
- Yeah, I mean, I'm one
of my goals right now.

3175
02:09:42,874 --> 02:09:45,242
And I guess another reason
that I haven't done Alcor yet

3176
02:09:45,243 --> 02:09:48,846
is I think there's other
ways of extending life

3177
02:09:48,847 --> 02:09:50,581
that are a little
more accessible.

3178
02:09:50,582 --> 02:09:52,549
I mean, Alcor is
a pretty big risk,

3179
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:56,587
the chances of actually being
revived are extremely low,

3180
02:09:56,588 --> 02:09:58,288
but it's sort of
a Pascal's Wager,

3181
02:09:58,289 --> 02:09:59,990
it's like, what's
the alternative?

3182
02:09:59,991 --> 02:10:01,191
- Yeah, what do I lose?

3183
02:10:01,192 --> 02:10:02,392
I may as well.

3184
02:10:02,393 --> 02:10:03,861
- Well, one of the
things I'm doing now,

3185
02:10:03,862 --> 02:10:04,829
actually, next week,

3186
02:10:04,830 --> 02:10:08,065
is getting my stem cells
cryonically preserved.

3187
02:10:08,066 --> 02:10:09,867
So yeah, I'm going to a company

3188
02:10:09,868 --> 02:10:13,237
called Forever Labs
in San Francisco.

3189
02:10:13,238 --> 02:10:14,438
They actually think
they're based in Michigan,

3190
02:10:14,439 --> 02:10:16,907
but they have a clinic
in San Francisco,

3191
02:10:16,908 --> 02:10:18,408
they're gonna extract
the stem cells,

3192
02:10:18,409 --> 02:10:21,144
and then bank them for
the rest of my life.

3193
02:10:21,145 --> 02:10:23,914
- So you can use those
for therapies or?

3194
02:10:23,915 --> 02:10:25,582
- Exactly, yeah, yeah.

3195
02:10:25,583 --> 02:10:30,554
So say, I have an organ down
the line that needs repair.

3196
02:10:30,555 --> 02:10:33,423
Now I have stem cells
from my younger self,

3197
02:10:33,424 --> 02:10:35,592
that we could use, or
maybe they'll develop

3198
02:10:35,593 --> 02:10:38,595
age reversal technologies
down the line.

3199
02:10:38,596 --> 02:10:41,465
And then I could use
those stem cells,

3200
02:10:41,466 --> 02:10:44,568
they've already done
that in rodents.

3201
02:10:44,569 --> 02:10:48,572
And done some very basic,
clinical studies with humans,

3202
02:10:48,573 --> 02:10:52,676
where they've given human stem
cells from younger donors.

3203
02:10:52,677 --> 02:10:55,479
And actually, older
adults are able to be

3204
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:59,650
they show more physical fitness,
more cognitive sharpness,

3205
02:10:59,651 --> 02:11:03,253
after the stem cell injection.

3206
02:11:03,254 --> 02:11:06,623
But also, there's, with
that particular study,

3207
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:08,525
when they receive too
much of the stem cells,

3208
02:11:08,526 --> 02:11:11,161
they actually have
negative side effects.

3209
02:11:11,162 --> 02:11:12,996
But that's probably
because their immune system

3210
02:11:12,997 --> 02:11:15,565
is reacting to somebody
else's stem cells,

3211
02:11:15,566 --> 02:11:18,168
which is why there's a
benefit in banking your own.

3212
02:11:18,169 --> 02:11:19,703
- Wow, banking your
own stem cells.

3213
02:11:19,704 --> 02:11:22,472
I think that sounds brilliant,
I would love to do it--

3214
02:11:22,473 --> 02:11:24,508
- And they do with
kids, with babies now.

3215
02:11:24,509 --> 02:11:25,609
- Take the baby stem cells,

3216
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:28,278
and you've got like the
freshest best stem cells.

3217
02:11:28,279 --> 02:11:30,080
And then when you're super
old, and you're like,

3218
02:11:30,081 --> 02:11:31,481
Oh, my liver could
use some help.

3219
02:11:31,482 --> 02:11:32,482
They'll be like,
when you were a baby,

3220
02:11:32,483 --> 02:11:35,352
we took these things out
and they've been frozen.

3221
02:11:35,353 --> 02:11:37,187
So they're still fresh.

3222
02:11:37,188 --> 02:11:43,560
Well, it seems to me like I
should go, when I naturally go.

3223
02:11:43,561 --> 02:11:46,063
- I think maybe you're
feeling a sense of fairness,

3224
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:49,499
or just what's socially,
the right thing to do.

3225
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:51,735
Because if everybody around you,

3226
02:11:51,736 --> 02:11:53,637
if the technology were
available to everybody,

3227
02:11:53,638 --> 02:11:57,474
and everybody you knew
was living to 100 or 120,

3228
02:11:57,475 --> 02:12:01,578
I think it would be it
would feel more okay.

3229
02:12:01,579 --> 02:12:04,281
But it feels sort
of unfair to say,

3230
02:12:04,282 --> 02:12:08,618
Okay, I'm entitled to
this new technology,

3231
02:12:08,619 --> 02:12:11,655
or I'm entitled to more
life and other people,

3232
02:12:11,656 --> 02:12:13,457
the rest of the world isn't--

3233
02:12:13,458 --> 02:12:14,658
- I'm so good.
- And I find that

3234
02:12:14,659 --> 02:12:17,060
really admirable actually.
- The world needs me forever,

3235
02:12:17,061 --> 02:12:20,030
not forever, but the
world just needs me.

3236
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:23,266
If I would left the world,
oh, that'd be such a tragedy.

3237
02:12:23,267 --> 02:12:25,435
to the world, wow!

3238
02:12:25,436 --> 02:12:26,570
- But it kind of feels like

3239
02:12:26,571 --> 02:12:29,639
you're breaking
some sort of like,

3240
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:34,177
agreement that the whole
human race has accepted,

3241
02:12:34,178 --> 02:12:37,481
like, I'm going
to defy something

3242
02:12:37,482 --> 02:12:39,683
that we've all sort
of mutually agreed

3243
02:12:39,684 --> 02:12:42,586
is the way things are.

3244
02:12:42,587 --> 02:12:45,088
But if we all mutually
agree something else,

3245
02:12:45,089 --> 02:12:48,058
because it becomes so
widespread or ubiquitous,

3246
02:12:48,059 --> 02:12:49,459
then it doesn't feel like

3247
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:50,694
you've sort of transgressed

3248
02:12:50,695 --> 02:12:54,431
or is nothing to
feel, weird about.

3249
02:12:54,432 --> 02:12:56,733
- Right, it's a really
interesting way to frame it.

3250
02:12:56,734 --> 02:12:58,201
I wanna point out, though,

3251
02:12:58,202 --> 02:13:00,704
that although Max
really emphasized

3252
02:13:00,705 --> 02:13:03,140
that he's not
selling immortality,

3253
02:13:03,141 --> 02:13:05,776
they're very much is a
belief in immortality

3254
02:13:05,777 --> 02:13:08,445
that you'll hear
from their members,

3255
02:13:08,446 --> 02:13:10,480
especially in a
sort of digital way

3256
02:13:10,481 --> 02:13:15,085
where their consciousness can
be recreated in a computer.

3257
02:13:15,086 --> 02:13:16,420
And at that point,
it doesn't seem

3258
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:18,188
like there's still
this inevitable,

3259
02:13:18,189 --> 02:13:21,291
but you could get hit
by a bus, but you could,

3260
02:13:21,292 --> 02:13:23,260
be in an accident, at
that point it's like,

3261
02:13:23,261 --> 02:13:25,295
No, but I never will
be because I will exist

3262
02:13:25,296 --> 02:13:27,397
and be replicated as
digital conscious.

3263
02:13:27,398 --> 02:13:29,499
And that I don't wanna do,

3264
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:30,467
I don't care if
other people do it.

3265
02:13:30,468 --> 02:13:32,469
I just feel like I'm not
gonna burden the world

3266
02:13:32,470 --> 02:13:35,572
with more of me than it needs.

3267
02:13:35,573 --> 02:13:37,607
- I have trouble wrapping
my mind around that one,

3268
02:13:37,608 --> 02:13:41,078
in the area I wanna say yes,
I'll do it, like why not?

3269
02:13:41,079 --> 02:13:42,646
I wanna try everything.

3270
02:13:42,647 --> 02:13:44,714
But to me somehow
there's a disconnect

3271
02:13:44,715 --> 02:13:46,283
where that doesn't
feel like me anymore.

3272
02:13:46,284 --> 02:13:49,719
Maybe I'm so embodied, that
feels a little bit like

3273
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:53,557
he was describing people want
to preserve their entire body

3274
02:13:53,558 --> 02:13:55,759
because it's hard to
conceive of yourself

3275
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:59,162
as just a head or
just a consciousness.

3276
02:13:59,163 --> 02:14:03,366
So it's just hard to imagine,
if I can't experience

3277
02:14:03,367 --> 02:14:05,669
if I don't have
a physical, like,

3278
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:09,239
visceral experience
of the world.

3279
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:12,709
And that constant feedback,
what is life even?

3280
02:14:12,710 --> 02:14:14,711
- It's kind of
lonely in a weird way

3281
02:14:14,712 --> 02:14:18,648
- Yeah.
- Right, lonely.

3282
02:14:18,649 --> 02:14:22,419
I guess you could
have a robot body.

3283
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:24,121
- It's like, how do
you even have a thought

3284
02:14:24,122 --> 02:14:26,490
really without this input?

3285
02:14:26,491 --> 02:14:28,425
- Well, I think the idea is
that you would have inputs

3286
02:14:28,426 --> 02:14:32,395
from some kind of like, Cyborg
body that they built you

3287
02:14:32,396 --> 02:14:33,763
that they injected
your consciousness

3288
02:14:33,764 --> 02:14:36,600
into through the wire right?

3289
02:14:36,601 --> 02:14:38,702
But at that point, you were
talking about true immortality.

3290
02:14:38,703 --> 02:14:41,771
Because you've come up with
a way to solve any accident

3291
02:14:41,772 --> 02:14:44,441
that ever happens to
you, you will never die.

3292
02:14:44,442 --> 02:14:46,843
And that's very different
than a bring me back

3293
02:14:46,844 --> 02:14:50,714
when you have a cure for
this cognitive problem

3294
02:14:50,715 --> 02:14:52,315
that I'm developing.

3295
02:14:52,316 --> 02:14:53,817
Bring me back, cure it,
and then I get to live

3296
02:14:53,818 --> 02:14:56,720
for another like, I don't know,
a couple of decades or what?

3297
02:14:56,721 --> 02:14:57,921
I don't know.

3298
02:14:57,922 --> 02:15:01,224
Wow, this is all fascinating,
and very important stuff.

3299
02:15:01,225 --> 02:15:02,926
Lisbeth Thank you very much.
- Thanks Michael.

3300
02:15:02,927 --> 02:15:04,561
- Thank you.

3301
02:15:04,562 --> 02:15:06,429
And without further ado,
we're gonna keep bulldozing on

3302
02:15:06,430 --> 02:15:10,433
through here we are
with your Brain on Tech,

3303
02:15:10,434 --> 02:15:14,437
not your brain made out of
tech, but your brain on tech.

3304
02:15:14,438 --> 02:15:16,373
(upbeat music)

3305
02:15:16,374 --> 02:15:17,607
Oh, hello.

3306
02:15:17,608 --> 02:15:20,644
technology isn't just
changing our lives.

3307
02:15:20,645 --> 02:15:23,446
It's changing our brains.

3308
02:15:23,447 --> 02:15:26,616
Not just how they think,
but how they look.

3309
02:15:26,617 --> 02:15:29,853
It's been shown that playing
certain video games for hours

3310
02:15:29,854 --> 02:15:32,289
can improve your
memory for details,

3311
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:35,725
your ability to navigate
space, in video games,

3312
02:15:35,726 --> 02:15:40,330
and can make your brain well
certain parts of it bigger.

3313
02:15:40,331 --> 02:15:43,233
But scientists want to know
if exploring digital worlds

3314
02:15:43,234 --> 02:15:46,436
can change our brains in
ways that improve our ability

3315
02:15:46,437 --> 02:15:48,605
to navigate the real world.

3316
02:15:48,606 --> 02:15:53,343
To find out, we've built a giant
maze to test their theories

3317
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:57,214
for the first time ever,
outside the world of computers.

3318
02:15:57,215 --> 02:15:59,416
Now my job.

3319
02:15:59,417 --> 02:16:00,984
I'm the lab rat.

3320
02:16:00,985 --> 02:16:19,569
(upbeat music)

3321
02:16:19,570 --> 02:16:21,571
(vacuum cleaner humming)

3322
02:16:21,572 --> 02:16:24,474
Our brains have been
profoundly transformed

3323
02:16:24,475 --> 02:16:26,643
by our interactions
with technology.

3324
02:16:26,644 --> 02:16:28,778
A lot of the information
that I used to have to store

3325
02:16:28,779 --> 02:16:32,315
in my brain is now
stored in my phone,

3326
02:16:32,316 --> 02:16:34,583
my contacts, my schedule.

3327
02:16:34,584 --> 02:16:35,919
In many ways, I've delegated

3328
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:38,521
what used to be
done by this organ,

3329
02:16:38,522 --> 02:16:41,824
to this new external organ.

3330
02:16:41,825 --> 02:16:43,826
Doing that frees up
my brains resources

3331
02:16:43,827 --> 02:16:45,028
for other things that matter,

3332
02:16:45,029 --> 02:16:48,331
or that technology can't
quite do for us yet.

3333
02:16:48,332 --> 02:16:52,302
So while we all don't have
implants in our brains, yet,

3334
02:16:52,303 --> 02:16:55,638
technology has already
found a way into our heads,

3335
02:16:55,639 --> 02:16:58,540
which is why you may
find it deeply disturbing

3336
02:16:58,541 --> 02:17:10,387
to see me do
something like this.

3337
02:17:10,388 --> 02:17:12,722
Studies show we can
improve our brains

3338
02:17:12,723 --> 02:17:14,790
by having enriching experiences,

3339
02:17:14,791 --> 02:17:17,661
like playing a new
challenging video game.

3340
02:17:17,662 --> 02:17:20,697
To learn more about this, I
came to UC Irvine Stark lab

3341
02:17:20,698 --> 02:17:23,932
to speak with experts in the
field of learning and memory.

3342
02:17:23,933 --> 02:17:27,503
So Dane and Craig, you guys
work on learning and memory,

3343
02:17:27,504 --> 02:17:28,672
What about them?

3344
02:17:28,673 --> 02:17:31,574
- So the lab is trying to
figure out how memory works,

3345
02:17:31,575 --> 02:17:34,744
how it works in the brain,
and one brain structure

3346
02:17:34,745 --> 02:17:36,446
and the temporal lobe

3347
02:17:36,447 --> 02:17:39,915
that we know is important to
memory is the hippocampus.

3348
02:17:39,916 --> 02:17:42,686
- So what does the
hippocampus do?

3349
02:17:42,687 --> 02:17:44,486
- We know it has
a role in memory

3350
02:17:44,487 --> 02:17:46,823
and really a certain
kind of memory.

3351
02:17:46,824 --> 02:17:48,892
The hippocampus is really
involved when you need

3352
02:17:48,893 --> 02:17:52,762
to rapidly form new
arbitrary associations

3353
02:17:52,763 --> 02:17:55,531
in remembering what
you did yesterday,

3354
02:17:55,532 --> 02:17:56,966
definitely needs
the hippocampus.

3355
02:17:56,967 --> 02:17:59,636
Maybe we'll go to the store,
we park our car in the lot.

3356
02:17:59,637 --> 02:18:01,104
And we need to be
able to remember,

3357
02:18:01,105 --> 02:18:02,872
not just I parked
my car in the lot,

3358
02:18:02,873 --> 02:18:06,842
I parked my car in this
exact spot in the lot.

3359
02:18:06,843 --> 02:18:09,479
And those details, that's
what the hippocampus

3360
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:11,681
seems to really be
helping us out on.

3361
02:18:11,682 --> 02:18:13,516
- And you keep looking
down at this piece

3362
02:18:13,517 --> 02:18:16,352
of chewed bubblegum on the
book, is that a hippocampus?

3363
02:18:16,353 --> 02:18:18,822
- [Dr. Dane] Yes, this
actually is my hippocampus.

3364
02:18:18,823 --> 02:18:20,557
- Is this the whole thing?

3365
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:21,790
- That's it.

3366
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:22,726
- Oh, there's one
on the other side--

3367
02:18:22,727 --> 02:18:23,660
- That looks just like this.

3368
02:18:23,661 --> 02:18:24,661
- Yeah, mirror image of it.

3369
02:18:24,662 --> 02:18:27,731
- [Michael] In 2015, Dr.
Stark and Dr. Clemenson

3370
02:18:27,732 --> 02:18:31,034
conducted a study to show how
video games affect the brain.

3371
02:18:31,035 --> 02:18:32,435
They gathered participants

3372
02:18:32,436 --> 02:18:33,837
who normally didn't
play video games

3373
02:18:33,838 --> 02:18:35,771
and split them up
into three groups,

3374
02:18:35,772 --> 02:18:37,539
a control group who didn't play

3375
02:18:37,540 --> 02:18:39,142
any video games for two weeks,

3376
02:18:39,143 --> 02:18:40,744
and active control
group who played

3377
02:18:40,745 --> 02:18:42,779
two dimensional
games for two weeks,

3378
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:44,481
and an experimental
group who played

3379
02:18:44,482 --> 02:18:46,583
3D games for two weeks.

3380
02:18:46,584 --> 02:18:48,651
Beforehand, they had
all the participants

3381
02:18:48,652 --> 02:18:49,919
perform two virtual tasks

3382
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:52,822
on computers to measure
their spatial memory.

3383
02:18:52,823 --> 02:18:53,655
- As soon as they came back,

3384
02:18:53,656 --> 02:18:55,592
we re administered
those two tasks.

3385
02:18:55,593 --> 02:18:57,794
And what we found was that the
people who played the 3D game

3386
02:18:57,795 --> 02:18:59,863
saw an improvement in
their test scores,

3387
02:18:59,864 --> 02:19:03,733
whereas the control group and
active control group did not.

3388
02:19:03,734 --> 02:19:05,668
We didn't do brain scans,
but we can speculate

3389
02:19:05,669 --> 02:19:06,936
that there were changes

3390
02:19:06,937 --> 02:19:09,839
to the experimental
groups hippocampus.

3391
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:13,143
- So what are we gonna
be doing to me here?

3392
02:19:13,144 --> 02:19:14,911
- So we're gonna do everything
that we've done before

3393
02:19:14,912 --> 02:19:17,847
in our past studies, except
we're gonna add two new things.

3394
02:19:17,848 --> 02:19:20,517
The first is we're gonna
add some brain scans

3395
02:19:20,518 --> 02:19:21,485
to see if we see a change

3396
02:19:21,486 --> 02:19:23,453
in the structural side
of your hippocampus.

3397
02:19:23,454 --> 02:19:24,687
I mean, we've never
actually looked

3398
02:19:24,688 --> 02:19:25,622
at somebody's brain scans

3399
02:19:25,623 --> 02:19:27,656
before and after they
play video games.

3400
02:19:27,657 --> 02:19:29,092
And the second thing
we're actually gonna do

3401
02:19:29,093 --> 02:19:31,761
is we're gonna put you
through a real world space.

3402
02:19:31,762 --> 02:19:34,798
- You're gonna be
the rat in a maze.

3403
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:37,065
- [Michael] This is
truly untested territory.

3404
02:19:37,066 --> 02:19:39,636
The effect of video
gaming on spatial memory

3405
02:19:39,637 --> 02:19:41,771
has never been studied in
a physical environment.

3406
02:19:41,772 --> 02:19:44,574
On a scale this big
and comprehensive,

3407
02:19:44,575 --> 02:19:46,543
I will have to
navigate my way through

3408
02:19:46,544 --> 02:19:50,780
a 3600 square foot
physical maze,

3409
02:19:50,781 --> 02:19:53,082
will playing video games
improve my mental skills

3410
02:19:53,083 --> 02:19:54,717
in the real world?

3411
02:19:54,718 --> 02:19:59,722
If so, society will have a
whole new way to look at gaming.

3412
02:19:59,723 --> 02:20:02,692
First, we had to get baseline
measurements of my brain.

3413
02:20:02,693 --> 02:20:03,827
- Welcome to the MRI center,

3414
02:20:03,828 --> 02:20:06,729
we're gonna be taking a
whole series of scans of you

3415
02:20:06,730 --> 02:20:09,666
as the before scan to then
see what's gonna be happening

3416
02:20:09,667 --> 02:20:11,835
to your brain as a function
of actually doing the gaming

3417
02:20:11,836 --> 02:20:13,736
- Cool, what kind of
things are you looking for?

3418
02:20:13,737 --> 02:20:16,172
- Changes in the size and
shape of your hippocampus

3419
02:20:16,173 --> 02:20:19,676
and also changes
in the connectivity
between brain regions.

3420
02:20:19,677 --> 02:20:22,111
- My brain was scanned
using diffusion MRI

3421
02:20:22,112 --> 02:20:26,716
with a special emphasis on
my all important hippocampus.

3422
02:20:26,717 --> 02:20:29,953
Diffusion MRIs, I'd
never had one before.

3423
02:20:29,954 --> 02:20:31,254
I had a bunch for this episode.

3424
02:20:31,255 --> 02:20:33,690
By the way, Daniel,
welcome back.

3425
02:20:33,691 --> 02:20:35,058
- I'm glad to be here.

3426
02:20:35,059 --> 02:20:36,759
- I'm glad you're here too,

3427
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:40,163
what the heck is a diffusion
MRI, I had like five of them.

3428
02:20:40,164 --> 02:20:43,700
They're different, they
would make my chest twitch.

3429
02:20:43,701 --> 02:20:46,603
Yeah, interesting. I'm actually
not sure why that happened.

3430
02:20:46,604 --> 02:20:48,638
And actually had my
first ever diffusion MRI

3431
02:20:48,639 --> 02:20:50,073
done a few weeks ago.

3432
02:20:50,074 --> 02:20:53,076
- Was it for a health
reason or for a study?

3433
02:20:53,077 --> 02:20:56,579
- My lab mate wanted to
test his scanning protocol.

3434
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:58,815
And he actually just asked
if I could sit in there

3435
02:20:58,816 --> 02:21:00,984
so I was watching Star Trek

3436
02:21:00,985 --> 02:21:03,586
while I had my
diffusion MRI done.

3437
02:21:03,587 --> 02:21:04,521
- That's not bad.

3438
02:21:04,522 --> 02:21:06,890
I mean, they're they're loud.

3439
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:08,591
- Yeah, yeah.

3440
02:21:08,592 --> 02:21:10,894
- But how was, well I guess
we should even start with

3441
02:21:10,895 --> 02:21:14,764
like an MRI, basically how
that works, and then diffusion.

3442
02:21:14,765 --> 02:21:17,734
- So an MRI is using
magnetic fields

3443
02:21:17,735 --> 02:21:21,938
to image various kinds of
molecules in your brain.

3444
02:21:21,939 --> 02:21:23,907
And depending on the
scanning protocol,

3445
02:21:23,908 --> 02:21:25,708
you can pick up
on different kinds

3446
02:21:25,709 --> 02:21:28,011
of structures in your brain.

3447
02:21:28,012 --> 02:21:30,680
And what diffusion MRI
specifically is doing

3448
02:21:30,681 --> 02:21:33,983
is looking at the direction
of water flow in your brain.

3449
02:21:33,984 --> 02:21:37,854
So if you look at a really
big white matter tract,

3450
02:21:37,855 --> 02:21:40,323
so white matter is
the sort of big wires

3451
02:21:40,324 --> 02:21:42,659
that bridge different areas
of our brains together.

3452
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:45,828
So you have a cortex,
actually, may I?

3453
02:21:45,829 --> 02:21:48,998
- Please, yeah, visual aids.

3454
02:21:48,999 --> 02:21:50,900
- So they actually don't
really show it here.

3455
02:21:50,901 --> 02:21:54,671
But all this stuff on the
inside would be white matter.

3456
02:21:54,672 --> 02:21:56,739
So it's like if I have
some area here that needs

3457
02:21:56,740 --> 02:21:58,875
to send a signal to
some area over here,

3458
02:21:58,876 --> 02:22:00,777
there's a large
basically white wire,

3459
02:22:00,778 --> 02:22:03,313
- And it's a white
because it's myelinated.

3460
02:22:03,314 --> 02:22:04,681
- Exactly.
- It's covered in fat.

3461
02:22:04,682 --> 02:22:05,882
- Exactly, yeah.

3462
02:22:05,883 --> 02:22:07,784
Which helps the
signal transaction.

3463
02:22:07,785 --> 02:22:09,152
- So if this was a
real person's brain,

3464
02:22:09,153 --> 02:22:11,254
we would we would see
a more white color

3465
02:22:11,255 --> 02:22:12,956
on the inside than
we do on this model.

3466
02:22:12,957 --> 02:22:15,592
- Yeah exactly, it would
literally be gray up here,

3467
02:22:15,593 --> 02:22:16,759
and white on the inside.

3468
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:18,227
- Gray matter white matter.
- Yep.

3469
02:22:18,228 --> 02:22:19,295
- And so diffusion MRIs

3470
02:22:19,296 --> 02:22:22,231
are looking at that white
matter, because what?

3471
02:22:22,232 --> 02:22:24,801
It has more water
content, and there--

3472
02:22:24,802 --> 02:22:26,269
- So it's that the direction

3473
02:22:26,270 --> 02:22:27,971
of the water flow
is more consistent.

3474
02:22:27,972 --> 02:22:29,072
So there's water flowing

3475
02:22:29,073 --> 02:22:30,807
in a bunch of
directions in the brain.

3476
02:22:30,808 --> 02:22:32,909
But let's say you look at a
little chunk of gray matter,

3477
02:22:32,910 --> 02:22:34,777
there's not gonna be a
consistent direction,

3478
02:22:34,778 --> 02:22:36,112
it's gonna be going
in all directions.

3479
02:22:36,113 --> 02:22:38,748
If you average them out,
there's not a single,

3480
02:22:38,749 --> 02:22:40,149
like trajectory for water for.

3481
02:22:40,150 --> 02:22:44,187
- Sure, what does the
trajectory of water flow mean?

3482
02:22:44,188 --> 02:22:46,889
Like, why is water
flowing in my brain?

3483
02:22:46,890 --> 02:22:48,725
- Well, your brain has
tons of water in it, right?

3484
02:22:48,726 --> 02:22:50,226
- Yeah.

3485
02:22:50,227 --> 02:22:52,895
- And water is flowing along
these white matter tracks,

3486
02:22:52,896 --> 02:22:54,664
and it's going along
that direction.

3487
02:22:54,665 --> 02:22:56,132
And so if you are tracking

3488
02:22:56,133 --> 02:22:57,333
the direction of water
flow in the brain,

3489
02:22:57,334 --> 02:23:00,637
and you can see a consistent
sort of vector of water flow

3490
02:23:00,638 --> 02:23:02,005
from here to here to here
to here to here to here,

3491
02:23:02,006 --> 02:23:03,306
it tells me there's probably

3492
02:23:03,307 --> 02:23:06,142
a white matter tract
going this way.

3493
02:23:06,143 --> 02:23:09,045
- Right, Okay, so are we
looking at actual functions,

3494
02:23:09,046 --> 02:23:10,947
like the fact that water
went from there to there

3495
02:23:10,948 --> 02:23:12,815
when you had this
particular experience,

3496
02:23:12,816 --> 02:23:15,785
Or thought means that
what the two brain regions

3497
02:23:15,786 --> 02:23:17,654
were communicating, or one?

3498
02:23:17,655 --> 02:23:20,723
- No, so that would be what
we call a functional scan.

3499
02:23:20,724 --> 02:23:22,125
So this is a structural scan?

3500
02:23:22,126 --> 02:23:23,726
It's a way of looking at the--

3501
02:23:23,727 --> 02:23:25,261
- So you're saying diffusion
is just structural.

3502
02:23:25,262 --> 02:23:26,429
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Got it.

3503
02:23:26,430 --> 02:23:30,867
- It's an anatomical scan of
basically, your connectum.

3504
02:23:30,868 --> 02:23:32,802
- Right, it's showing
what's connected to what?

3505
02:23:32,803 --> 02:23:34,937
- Exactly.
- Not why they're connected,

3506
02:23:34,938 --> 02:23:37,306
and what causes their
connection to be important.

3507
02:23:37,307 --> 02:23:39,709
It's just physically,

3508
02:23:39,710 --> 02:23:42,111
I need the plans to make a
great model of your brain,

3509
02:23:42,112 --> 02:23:46,783
diffusion MRI would give me a
really great looking map of.

3510
02:23:46,784 --> 02:23:48,451
- Exactly, it's
literally a wiring map,

3511
02:23:48,452 --> 02:23:49,619
a large scale wiring map.

3512
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:52,822
So what you're missing is a
lot of the miniature wires

3513
02:23:52,823 --> 02:23:53,757
of the brain, because
if you're looking at

3514
02:23:53,758 --> 02:23:55,925
like a little chunk
of gray matter here,

3515
02:23:55,926 --> 02:23:58,094
there are lots of
microscopic wires

3516
02:23:58,095 --> 02:23:59,829
connecting those neurons.

3517
02:23:59,830 --> 02:24:01,831
Diffusion MRI
can't pick that up.

3518
02:24:01,832 --> 02:24:04,167
But what it can do is pick
up on the really big wires,

3519
02:24:04,168 --> 02:24:07,470
- The large scale wires
from through white matter.

3520
02:24:07,471 --> 02:24:08,304
Okay, perfect.

3521
02:24:08,305 --> 02:24:10,139
And is the hippocampus,

3522
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:12,008
it's counted in that
because we're really looking

3523
02:24:12,009 --> 02:24:14,744
at the hippocampus's
size in my brain

3524
02:24:14,745 --> 02:24:16,245
through this diffusion MRI.

3525
02:24:16,246 --> 02:24:20,450
- So I think that was probably
more for the connectivity

3526
02:24:20,451 --> 02:24:22,852
of the hippocampus,
a hippocampus would
be gray matter,

3527
02:24:22,853 --> 02:24:25,188
but it's gonna be
talking to other regions

3528
02:24:25,189 --> 02:24:26,122
of the brain via--

3529
02:24:26,123 --> 02:24:27,724
- Via white matter, got it.

3530
02:24:27,725 --> 02:24:28,991
Okay, perfect.

3531
02:24:28,992 --> 02:24:29,926
We're gonna go back to
the episode right now.

3532
02:24:29,927 --> 02:24:30,860
- Let's do it.

3533
02:24:30,861 --> 02:24:32,829
(upbeat music)

3534
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:35,832
- So this first test is a
standard memory test that we do,

3535
02:24:35,833 --> 02:24:38,067
it's called an object
recognition memory test.

3536
02:24:38,068 --> 02:24:39,802
- This test began by showing me

3537
02:24:39,803 --> 02:24:42,438
a series of random objects,

3538
02:24:42,439 --> 02:24:46,776
I did my best to commit
every one of them to memory.

3539
02:24:46,777 --> 02:24:48,010
Okay, finished.

3540
02:24:48,011 --> 02:24:49,846
- All right, what we're
gonna do now, though,

3541
02:24:49,847 --> 02:24:53,316
is we're gonna test your
memory for those objects.

3542
02:24:53,317 --> 02:24:55,218
And this is actually
where it starts to tap

3543
02:24:55,219 --> 02:24:57,420
into the hippocampus that
we know is so important

3544
02:24:57,421 --> 02:24:59,322
for things like spatial memory.

3545
02:24:59,323 --> 02:25:01,991
- This time, I had to view
another series of objects

3546
02:25:01,992 --> 02:25:04,427
and identify any that
were identical to the ones

3547
02:25:04,428 --> 02:25:06,162
I'd seen previously.

3548
02:25:06,163 --> 02:25:07,897
The catch?

3549
02:25:07,898 --> 02:25:09,532
Some of the items were very
similar to the earlier ones,

3550
02:25:09,533 --> 02:25:11,834
but not exactly the same.

3551
02:25:11,835 --> 02:25:16,105
This tested my memory
for details, and
very slight changes.

3552
02:25:16,106 --> 02:25:17,273
Okay.

3553
02:25:17,274 --> 02:25:19,809
Next up a virtual
version of a water maze,

3554
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:21,844
normally used by rodents.

3555
02:25:21,845 --> 02:25:24,547
- [Dr. Stark] The idea is
that you are trying to locate

3556
02:25:24,548 --> 02:25:26,983
a hidden platform
in a pool of water.

3557
02:25:26,984 --> 02:25:30,520
- Oh, man, so glad
I'm not a lab rat.

3558
02:25:30,521 --> 02:25:33,556
This task really put my
spatial memory to the test,

3559
02:25:33,557 --> 02:25:36,826
I had to find the same
invisible underwater platform

3560
02:25:36,827 --> 02:25:38,327
over and over again,

3561
02:25:38,328 --> 02:25:40,797
using only the shapes of
the mountains as my guide,

3562
02:25:40,798 --> 02:25:43,065
but at least I didn't
have to get wet.

3563
02:25:43,066 --> 02:25:46,169
Ay, that was more
difficult than I expected.

3564
02:25:46,170 --> 02:25:47,537
- So these are
the sorts of tasks

3565
02:25:47,538 --> 02:25:48,971
that we've been able to do,

3566
02:25:48,972 --> 02:25:50,540
because we can put
them on a computer,

3567
02:25:50,541 --> 02:25:52,141
and we're gonna revisit them

3568
02:25:52,142 --> 02:25:53,876
after you've done
the video games.

3569
02:25:53,877 --> 02:25:57,013
But we also have a really
great opportunity here now

3570
02:25:57,014 --> 02:25:58,514
to be able to try to take it out

3571
02:25:58,515 --> 02:25:59,949
of just doing it on the computer

3572
02:25:59,950 --> 02:26:01,884
and actually get it
into the real world.

3573
02:26:01,885 --> 02:26:03,152
- Have you guys
done this before?

3574
02:26:03,153 --> 02:26:05,822
- No, we don't get to
do this kind of thing.

3575
02:26:05,823 --> 02:26:07,456
- Well, welcome
to the Mind Field.

3576
02:26:07,457 --> 02:26:08,291
- Awesome.

3577
02:26:08,292 --> 02:26:14,096
(upbeat music)

3578
02:26:14,097 --> 02:26:15,064
- [Dr. Stark] So this is it.

3579
02:26:15,065 --> 02:26:16,299
- [Michael] It's huge.

3580
02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:17,600
- This is what we
brought you here for

3581
02:26:17,601 --> 02:26:20,436
to have a real world
test of memory,

3582
02:26:20,437 --> 02:26:23,372
you're gonna be a
lab rat in a maze.

3583
02:26:23,373 --> 02:26:24,607
So this is a big first for us.

3584
02:26:24,608 --> 02:26:26,542
It's a big first really
for memory research.

3585
02:26:26,543 --> 02:26:27,877
- [Michael] So how do
you think that'll affect

3586
02:26:27,878 --> 02:26:29,612
what you guys have already seen,

3587
02:26:29,613 --> 02:26:31,848
which is that moving
around in a 3D environment

3588
02:26:31,849 --> 02:26:35,918
in the video game can actually
physically affect your brain,

3589
02:26:35,919 --> 02:26:36,986
- We would expect that

3590
02:26:36,987 --> 02:26:38,921
if we can somehow kind
of train your hippocampus

3591
02:26:38,922 --> 02:26:41,057
to be better at spatial
memory and spatial navigation,

3592
02:26:41,058 --> 02:26:43,492
we would see improvements
in some of these areas.

3593
02:26:43,493 --> 02:26:45,294
- And it's not just
gonna be running a maze,

3594
02:26:45,295 --> 02:26:47,864
you've got objects
embedded inside here.

3595
02:26:47,865 --> 02:26:49,232
And we're gonna be
testing your ability

3596
02:26:49,233 --> 02:26:51,167
to remember where everything is.

3597
02:26:51,168 --> 02:26:54,503
- And build a mental map of
whatever is inside there.

3598
02:26:54,504 --> 02:26:56,939
- So you have five
minutes, go on in explore,

3599
02:26:56,940 --> 02:26:58,875
learn the maze and
learn the objects.

3600
02:26:58,876 --> 02:26:59,876
- Go.

3601
02:26:59,877 --> 02:27:01,611
(upbeat music)

3602
02:27:01,612 --> 02:27:03,613
- Because the walls
were six feet tall,

3603
02:27:03,614 --> 02:27:06,182
I was unable to get
a bird's eye view.

3604
02:27:06,183 --> 02:27:08,885
My task was to create
a spatial memory

3605
02:27:08,886 --> 02:27:12,355
based entirely on the angles
and turns of the white walls

3606
02:27:12,356 --> 02:27:15,224
I could see at eye level
and a few tall trees

3607
02:27:15,225 --> 02:27:17,627
and light poles
outside of the maze.

3608
02:27:17,628 --> 02:27:21,330
Okay, so I've oriented myself,
the entrance is that way,

3609
02:27:21,331 --> 02:27:23,366
there's an exit over there.

3610
02:27:23,367 --> 02:27:26,135
I'm considering this the
right side that the left side,

3611
02:27:26,136 --> 02:27:28,371
I've got a vague idea
of where things are

3612
02:27:28,372 --> 02:27:31,674
that I feel like exist
along the outside edge,

3613
02:27:31,675 --> 02:27:34,677
but I don't know about a
lot of this stuff inside.

3614
02:27:34,678 --> 02:27:36,946
- And time.

3615
02:27:36,947 --> 02:27:39,248
All right, so now you've had
a chance to explore the maze,

3616
02:27:39,249 --> 02:27:40,683
find out where the objects are.

3617
02:27:40,684 --> 02:27:42,485
Now we're gonna
test your memory.

3618
02:27:42,486 --> 02:27:44,387
and we'll be timing you
and seeing where you go.

3619
02:27:44,388 --> 02:27:45,388
- Okay.
- Okay, you ready?

3620
02:27:45,389 --> 02:27:46,556
- I'm ready.

3621
02:27:46,557 --> 02:27:48,624
- [Dr. Clemenson] So first
object is the bicycle pump, go.

3622
02:27:48,625 --> 02:27:49,625
- Pump, okay.

3623
02:27:49,626 --> 02:27:52,028
(upbeat music)

3624
02:27:52,029 --> 02:27:54,697
Pump was just always
making right turns.

3625
02:27:54,698 --> 02:27:58,701
hugging the right
most part of pump.

3626
02:27:58,702 --> 02:27:59,702
(laughing)

3627
02:27:59,703 --> 02:28:01,203
Yes, easy, okay.

3628
02:28:01,204 --> 02:28:03,706
Now, I guess I do the
opposite to get out.

3629
02:28:03,707 --> 02:28:05,308
Left side.

3630
02:28:05,309 --> 02:28:07,543
Yep, I think I should
make this turn.

3631
02:28:07,544 --> 02:28:08,444
There it is.

3632
02:28:08,445 --> 02:28:10,713
(upbeat music)

3633
02:28:10,714 --> 02:28:11,614
Yes for a pump.

3634
02:28:11,615 --> 02:28:14,517
- All right, item
two the basketball.

3635
02:28:14,518 --> 02:28:17,586
- Later, Dr. Stark and Dr.
Clemenson would evaluate

3636
02:28:17,587 --> 02:28:19,722
my performance on
how fast I was,

3637
02:28:19,723 --> 02:28:21,390
the number of errors I made

3638
02:28:21,391 --> 02:28:23,693
and whether I took the most
optimal route each time.

3639
02:28:23,694 --> 02:28:25,027
- [Dr. Stark] And time.

3640
02:28:25,028 --> 02:28:27,430
- Third item is the cat, go.

3641
02:28:27,431 --> 02:28:29,732
- Here kitty, kitty kitty.

3642
02:28:29,733 --> 02:28:30,733
- Got it.

3643
02:28:30,734 --> 02:28:32,735
- The fourth item is the pillow.

3644
02:28:32,736 --> 02:28:34,170
- [Michael] Retracing my steps.

3645
02:28:34,171 --> 02:28:35,638
- The crab.
- Easy.

3646
02:28:35,639 --> 02:28:37,039
- The book.
- Okay.

3647
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:38,574
- The boot.

3648
02:28:38,575 --> 02:28:40,643
Last item is the
water bottle, go.

3649
02:28:40,644 --> 02:28:43,112
- Water bottle.

3650
02:28:43,113 --> 02:28:44,447
(upbeat music)

3651
02:28:44,448 --> 02:28:45,281
I think.

3652
02:28:45,282 --> 02:28:47,216
(upbeat music)

3653
02:28:47,217 --> 02:28:48,284
Yeah, it was back here.

3654
02:28:48,285 --> 02:28:51,253
(upbeat music)

3655
02:28:51,254 --> 02:28:54,757
Maybe on the other
side of this wall?

3656
02:28:54,758 --> 02:28:55,691
No?

3657
02:28:55,692 --> 02:28:57,426
Oh shit!

3658
02:28:57,427 --> 02:28:59,662
Okay, maybe it's down here.

3659
02:28:59,663 --> 02:29:03,499
Oh wait, that's no.

3660
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:05,701
That's the central cube.

3661
02:29:05,702 --> 02:29:08,637
It was down some sort
of a long corridor

3662
02:29:08,638 --> 02:29:13,509
like this in this area, oh man.

3663
02:29:13,510 --> 02:29:15,745
Until this point, things
had gone pretty well,

3664
02:29:15,746 --> 02:29:18,581
but now it felt like my
hippocampus was failing me.

3665
02:29:18,582 --> 02:29:20,383
With most of the items now gone

3666
02:29:20,384 --> 02:29:21,518
I couldn't use
them for reference

3667
02:29:21,519 --> 02:29:24,053
and it was difficult to
distinguish the differences

3668
02:29:24,054 --> 02:29:25,654
between the various
white corridors.

3669
02:29:25,655 --> 02:29:27,289
Oh dang it!

3670
02:29:27,290 --> 02:29:31,594
I went about, through, got it.

3671
02:29:31,595 --> 02:29:32,762
Bottle coming up.

3672
02:29:32,763 --> 02:29:34,330
- All right, there you go.

3673
02:29:34,331 --> 02:29:35,765
Got it, that was a
little tougher, huh?

3674
02:29:35,766 --> 02:29:36,699
- Yeah, that was tougher.

3675
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:38,701
- So we found all eight objects.

3676
02:29:38,702 --> 02:29:40,569
Now we're gonna make it a
little bit more difficult.

3677
02:29:40,570 --> 02:29:41,504
So we're gonna move
on to the next phase.

3678
02:29:41,505 --> 02:29:44,173
And that's gonna be
from the other side.

3679
02:29:44,174 --> 02:29:45,608
- [Dr. Stark] Navigating
the maze in reverse

3680
02:29:45,609 --> 02:29:48,711
will be an even bigger test
of your spatial memory.

3681
02:29:48,712 --> 02:29:52,715
We're gonna give you a list of
four things to get in order.

3682
02:29:52,716 --> 02:29:54,617
- So the first
sequence is the book,

3683
02:29:54,618 --> 02:29:57,753
the bottle, the
crayon and the boot.

3684
02:29:57,754 --> 02:29:58,554
Go.

3685
02:29:58,555 --> 02:29:59,655
- Book.

3686
02:29:59,656 --> 02:30:00,689
I think,

3687
02:30:00,690 --> 02:30:02,091
that's the ball.

3688
02:30:02,092 --> 02:30:05,361
(upbeat music)

3689
02:30:05,362 --> 02:30:06,629
Got it.

3690
02:30:06,630 --> 02:30:08,097
Yeah, bottle was that hard one.

3691
02:30:08,098 --> 02:30:11,734
But now, I remember
which alley to go down.

3692
02:30:11,735 --> 02:30:13,169
Perfect.

3693
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:15,137
Crayon

3694
02:30:15,138 --> 02:30:17,406
Boot, don't want that.

3695
02:30:17,407 --> 02:30:18,507
There it is.

3696
02:30:18,508 --> 02:30:20,476
Okay, now I need the boot.

3697
02:30:20,477 --> 02:30:22,445
Oh I just saw the boot.

3698
02:30:22,446 --> 02:30:24,580
But how did I?

3699
02:30:24,581 --> 02:30:25,514
Got it.

3700
02:30:25,515 --> 02:30:27,650
I'm done, I'm coming back.

3701
02:30:27,651 --> 02:30:28,684
Got them.

3702
02:30:28,685 --> 02:30:29,952
- All right.

3703
02:30:29,953 --> 02:30:31,754
- [Dr. Clemenson] So then the
next for the pump, the pillow,

3704
02:30:31,755 --> 02:30:33,689
the basketball and the cat.

3705
02:30:33,690 --> 02:30:34,824
- [Dr. Stark] All
right, excellent.

3706
02:30:34,825 --> 02:30:37,126
- [Dr. Clemenson] Good job.

3707
02:30:37,127 --> 02:30:38,394
- Okay, so that was really fun,

3708
02:30:38,395 --> 02:30:40,496
but I can't be the only subject.

3709
02:30:40,497 --> 02:30:42,498
This experiment
could use a control.

3710
02:30:42,499 --> 02:30:44,667
How else will we know
that me enriching my life

3711
02:30:44,668 --> 02:30:46,702
with daily video game playing

3712
02:30:46,703 --> 02:30:48,737
really causes a change
in my spatial memory?

3713
02:30:48,738 --> 02:30:49,772
Right?

3714
02:30:49,773 --> 02:30:50,907
Well, luckily for that,

3715
02:30:50,908 --> 02:30:54,443
we've got a nice matched
control, guys similar to me.

3716
02:30:54,444 --> 02:30:55,678
Okay, one of them
has too much hair.

3717
02:30:55,679 --> 02:30:57,413
But you guys look good.

3718
02:30:57,414 --> 02:30:58,380
You ready?

3719
02:30:58,381 --> 02:30:59,281
- [All] Ready.

3720
02:30:59,282 --> 02:31:00,549
- In this experiment,

3721
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:02,518
it was important to
have a control group,

3722
02:31:02,519 --> 02:31:04,720
my look alikes had to go
through the exact same tests

3723
02:31:04,721 --> 02:31:07,656
that I did to establish
their individual baselines,

3724
02:31:07,657 --> 02:31:09,525
the difference would
be that they would play

3725
02:31:09,526 --> 02:31:12,528
absolutely no video games
for the next 10 days,

3726
02:31:12,529 --> 02:31:14,330
then any change
in my performance

3727
02:31:14,331 --> 02:31:17,399
would be compared against
any changes in theirs.

3728
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:20,636
(upbeat music)

3729
02:31:20,637 --> 02:31:23,139
Next, I began my gaming regimen,

3730
02:31:23,140 --> 02:31:24,874
starting from an ideal baseline

3731
02:31:24,875 --> 02:31:29,378
since I hadn't played
video games in years.

3732
02:31:29,379 --> 02:31:31,714
Would 10 days of gaming
really make a difference?

3733
02:31:31,715 --> 02:31:37,620
Now Daniel, on YouTube, I'm
known as a pro gamer, right?

3734
02:31:37,621 --> 02:31:40,756
Every day, I'm like, Zelda!

3735
02:31:40,757 --> 02:31:42,191
You know what I
mean, you get it.

3736
02:31:42,192 --> 02:31:43,359
Any Who?

3737
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:44,793
I think a lot of people
might be wondering

3738
02:31:44,794 --> 02:31:48,831
what video game was Michael
playing during this test?

3739
02:31:48,832 --> 02:31:50,699
Well we couldn't tell
you during the episode

3740
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:54,203
because the makers of the
game didn't give us permission

3741
02:31:54,204 --> 02:31:55,771
to ever mention or show
any footage from the game.

3742
02:31:55,772 --> 02:31:58,340
So we had to replace my screen

3743
02:31:58,341 --> 02:32:00,609
with like generic stock footage.

3744
02:32:00,610 --> 02:32:02,244
I don't know outerspace
looking stuff,

3745
02:32:02,245 --> 02:32:04,813
which was very annoying,
because a lot of commenters

3746
02:32:04,814 --> 02:32:06,615
are like, that's not a game.

3747
02:32:06,616 --> 02:32:09,552
Here's the secret,
I'll tell you now.

3748
02:32:09,553 --> 02:32:12,388
I played

3749
02:32:12,389 --> 02:32:15,324
League of Legends.

3750
02:32:15,325 --> 02:32:16,525
(laughing)

3751
02:32:16,526 --> 02:32:19,795
And Daniel, let me tell
you, I was terrible.

3752
02:32:19,796 --> 02:32:23,199
And people made that
very clear to me.

3753
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:26,435
I've never been bullied
so much in my life,

3754
02:32:26,436 --> 02:32:27,670
- By people online or?

3755
02:32:27,671 --> 02:32:28,871
- By people online.

3756
02:32:28,872 --> 02:32:30,806
Because I would
join a game, right?

3757
02:32:30,807 --> 02:32:32,775
And I play and I'm
still kind of learning

3758
02:32:32,776 --> 02:32:33,910
how the game works.

3759
02:32:33,911 --> 02:32:38,380
And then when it was over,
people could like comment,

3760
02:32:38,381 --> 02:32:40,616
and they'd be like, I hate you.

3761
02:32:40,617 --> 02:32:44,386
And like you, I'm gonna
flag you for being so bad.

3762
02:32:44,387 --> 02:32:45,587
- Yeah,

3763
02:32:45,588 --> 02:32:48,424
I mean the point here wasn't
really good at the game so much

3764
02:32:48,425 --> 02:32:50,659
as it was to explore
three dimensional space.

3765
02:32:50,660 --> 02:32:53,629
- Exactly, I did not
get good at the game.

3766
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:58,634
But I did explore 3D spaces
I normally wasn't exploring.

3767
02:32:58,635 --> 02:33:00,536
- Right, because the game
involves a lot of strategy.

3768
02:33:00,537 --> 02:33:01,637
I'm assuming, I haven't played

3769
02:33:01,638 --> 02:33:02,972
League of Legends
so I don't know.

3770
02:33:02,973 --> 02:33:04,673
- Well, luckily,
I'm a pro gamer.

3771
02:33:04,674 --> 02:33:05,541
So let me just tell you--

3772
02:33:05,542 --> 02:33:07,977
- As established.
- As a pro gamer,

3773
02:33:07,978 --> 02:33:10,713
I would probably say,
League of Legends

3774
02:33:10,714 --> 02:33:15,417
is basically like
Mario meets checkers.

3775
02:33:15,418 --> 02:33:18,520
And

3776
02:33:18,521 --> 02:33:20,656
I didn't get better at the game.

3777
02:33:20,657 --> 02:33:21,924
But by playing it every day,

3778
02:33:21,925 --> 02:33:25,794
I really was investigating 3D
spaces in a new way every day.

3779
02:33:25,795 --> 02:33:26,962
- Which is what matters,

3780
02:33:26,963 --> 02:33:28,897
- Which is what
matters for this test.

3781
02:33:28,898 --> 02:33:31,700
- Right, I mean, I guess,
if they were testing

3782
02:33:31,701 --> 02:33:35,671
something like visual
working memory, for example,

3783
02:33:35,672 --> 02:33:36,972
then maybe your performance
wouldn't matter.

3784
02:33:36,973 --> 02:33:39,875
Because it's your ability to,

3785
02:33:39,876 --> 02:33:42,044
hold various things in the
map in your head at once

3786
02:33:42,045 --> 02:33:44,813
or your attention, for example,

3787
02:33:44,814 --> 02:33:46,649
but all they really cared
about was your ability

3788
02:33:46,650 --> 02:33:49,351
to learn a new space.

3789
02:33:49,352 --> 02:33:50,519
- Exactly.

3790
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:52,054
So let's get back to the episode

3791
02:33:52,055 --> 02:33:55,391
and explore some new
spaces ourselves.

3792
02:33:55,392 --> 02:33:58,560
For many of you out there
because some of this footage

3793
02:33:58,561 --> 02:34:00,996
is from my house
where I used to live.

3794
02:34:00,997 --> 02:34:05,534
And you'll get to see my
kitties, corn and pickle.

3795
02:34:05,535 --> 02:34:07,536
All right, here we go.

3796
02:34:07,537 --> 02:34:10,773
(upbeat music)

3797
02:34:10,774 --> 02:34:14,376
Technology isn't just affecting
the way we remember things.

3798
02:34:14,377 --> 02:34:16,045
It's also playing
with the empathy

3799
02:34:16,046 --> 02:34:19,315
and social circuits
of our brains.

3800
02:34:19,316 --> 02:34:21,650
In fact, in many cases,
we are more comfortable

3801
02:34:21,651 --> 02:34:24,620
relating to machines
than we are to people.

3802
02:34:24,621 --> 02:34:26,955
Just think about how much
we care about our phones.

3803
02:34:26,956 --> 02:34:29,625
roboticist, and
MIT Media Lab alum,

3804
02:34:29,626 --> 02:34:32,027
Alex Reben invented
the blab droid,

3805
02:34:32,028 --> 02:34:34,430
a miniature robot
equipped with a camera

3806
02:34:34,431 --> 02:34:35,731
and an innocent little voice

3807
02:34:35,732 --> 02:34:37,533
that asked very
personal questions

3808
02:34:37,534 --> 02:34:39,601
of unsuspecting pedestrians.

3809
02:34:39,602 --> 02:34:42,404
- [Robot] If you could
take back one mistake,

3810
02:34:42,405 --> 02:34:43,806
what would it be?

3811
02:34:43,807 --> 02:34:46,408
- Oh, gosh, I only
get to take back one?

3812
02:34:46,409 --> 02:34:47,710
- [Michael] The
majority of people

3813
02:34:47,711 --> 02:34:49,678
instantly shared
intimate details

3814
02:34:49,679 --> 02:34:50,613
- [Robot] Tell me something

3815
02:34:50,614 --> 02:34:53,382
that you've never told
a stranger before.

3816
02:34:53,383 --> 02:34:55,417
- I'm scared I won't
be able to love

3817
02:34:55,418 --> 02:34:59,855
and to let myself go
in a love relationship.

3818
02:34:59,856 --> 02:35:01,557
- In many ways, we
are more comfortable

3819
02:35:01,558 --> 02:35:05,394
talking to a machine
than a human.

3820
02:35:05,395 --> 02:35:07,696
But what about talking
through a machine?

3821
02:35:07,697 --> 02:35:10,766
I mean, it's often easier
to say difficult things

3822
02:35:10,767 --> 02:35:13,702
to a person by a text instead
of in real life, isn't it?

3823
02:35:13,703 --> 02:35:15,971
Well, what if the
person on the other end

3824
02:35:15,972 --> 02:35:20,976
wasn't a friend or a significant
other, but was a therapist?

3825
02:35:20,977 --> 02:35:23,612
A mental health care
startup called Talkspace

3826
02:35:23,613 --> 02:35:25,647
allows adult users
who pay a weekly fee

3827
02:35:25,648 --> 02:35:27,783
to text therapists for advice.

3828
02:35:27,784 --> 02:35:28,984
- [Advertiser] At Talkspace.

3829
02:35:28,985 --> 02:35:31,754
We believe that therapy
should be anonymous.

3830
02:35:31,755 --> 02:35:35,457
Stigma free, simple,
affordable and comfortable.

3831
02:35:35,458 --> 02:35:37,493
- Texting can give
users the distance

3832
02:35:37,494 --> 02:35:39,561
they need to be open and honest.

3833
02:35:39,562 --> 02:35:42,464
And messages can be sent
when the user wants,

3834
02:35:42,465 --> 02:35:45,167
not during an appointment
or business hours only

3835
02:35:45,168 --> 02:35:49,972
- [Advertiser] Talkspace,
therapy for how we live today.

3836
02:35:49,973 --> 02:35:51,440
- How am I?

3837
02:35:51,441 --> 02:35:57,146
Better now that my
phone is working?

3838
02:35:57,147 --> 02:35:58,580
(laughing)

3839
02:35:58,581 --> 02:35:59,782
Sometimes, however,
we aren't looking

3840
02:35:59,783 --> 02:36:01,850
for technology to comfort us.

3841
02:36:01,851 --> 02:36:06,588
We're finding ourselves
wanting to comfort technology.

3842
02:36:06,589 --> 02:36:11,727
This is a ROBOTIS OP2, cute
little fella, isn't he?

3843
02:36:11,728 --> 02:36:13,829
So how did that make you feel?

3844
02:36:13,830 --> 02:36:14,730
Bad?

3845
02:36:14,731 --> 02:36:15,898
Well why?

3846
02:36:15,899 --> 02:36:17,900
Robots are just machines,

3847
02:36:17,901 --> 02:36:20,135
metal and wires
and computer chips,

3848
02:36:20,136 --> 02:36:23,739
but we spend a lot of
time with technology.

3849
02:36:23,740 --> 02:36:26,742
We depend on technology
and we care about it.

3850
02:36:26,743 --> 02:36:28,010
But the degree to which

3851
02:36:28,011 --> 02:36:30,446
we empathize with it
depends on context.

3852
02:36:30,447 --> 02:36:34,583
(upbeat music)

3853
02:36:34,584 --> 02:36:38,020
Recently, my Vsauce
was invaded by bugs,

3854
02:36:38,021 --> 02:36:40,222
robot hexbugs that is.

3855
02:36:40,223 --> 02:36:41,990
These bugs are made of plastic,

3856
02:36:41,991 --> 02:36:45,727
metal electronic circuitry,
they aren't alive,

3857
02:36:45,728 --> 02:36:46,929
but could certain conditions

3858
02:36:46,930 --> 02:36:50,532
cause them to inspire
empathy in humans?

3859
02:36:50,533 --> 02:36:54,703
A 2015 MIT study found that
giving a robot movement,

3860
02:36:54,704 --> 02:36:56,705
a name and a personal backstory

3861
02:36:56,706 --> 02:36:59,208
tends to increase its
anthropomorphic effect,

3862
02:36:59,209 --> 02:37:02,144
which can lead to an
emotional can with humans.

3863
02:37:02,145 --> 02:37:03,712
We decided to see
this in action.

3864
02:37:03,713 --> 02:37:05,047
I'm Michael.
- Nice to meet you.

3865
02:37:05,048 --> 02:37:05,948
- Thank you for your help today.

3866
02:37:05,949 --> 02:37:07,549
- Of course pleasure.

3867
02:37:07,550 --> 02:37:09,084
- [Michael] In our
demonstration our subjects

3868
02:37:09,085 --> 02:37:10,619
think they're focused testing

3869
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:12,754
a new user friendly technology.

3870
02:37:12,755 --> 02:37:15,791
In this case, they're
given a lifeless hexbug

3871
02:37:15,792 --> 02:37:17,960
and then asked to describe it.

3872
02:37:17,961 --> 02:37:20,028
- This thing kind
of looks like a bug

3873
02:37:20,029 --> 02:37:21,230
only I don't know what it does.

3874
02:37:21,231 --> 02:37:22,998
It has a switch on the bottom.

3875
02:37:22,999 --> 02:37:24,700
- It's light.

3876
02:37:24,701 --> 02:37:27,269
- It's sort of a rectangle,
but the ends are like hexagon,

3877
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:29,805
- Then it was time
to test their empathy

3878
02:37:29,806 --> 02:37:31,039
Akrino, what I
would like to do now

3879
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:34,109
is place the item in the
middle of that block,

3880
02:37:34,110 --> 02:37:35,878
there's a magnet
that will hold it

3881
02:37:35,879 --> 02:37:39,248
and I would like for
you to take this mallet.

3882
02:37:39,249 --> 02:37:41,149
And please smash it.

3883
02:37:41,150 --> 02:37:41,984
- Yeah, really?

3884
02:37:41,985 --> 02:37:44,586
Okay, that's cool.

3885
02:37:44,587 --> 02:37:45,654
- Our participants demonstrated

3886
02:37:45,655 --> 02:37:48,857
no resistance to smashing
this lifeless object.

3887
02:37:48,858 --> 02:37:52,160
Many of them even
seemed to enjoy it.

3888
02:37:52,161 --> 02:37:54,730
Do you feel bad for breaking it?

3889
02:37:54,731 --> 02:37:57,299
- Not really, I felt
indifferent to it.

3890
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:59,067
- Not really, because
it wasn't real.

3891
02:37:59,068 --> 02:38:00,302
- Not really.

3892
02:38:00,303 --> 02:38:01,937
- While these subjects exhibited

3893
02:38:01,938 --> 02:38:04,540
no empathy to the
inanimate bugs.

3894
02:38:04,541 --> 02:38:05,841
Look what happened when we gave

3895
02:38:05,842 --> 02:38:08,877
the exact same bugs
names and movement.

3896
02:38:08,878 --> 02:38:10,078
This is Margaret.

3897
02:38:10,079 --> 02:38:11,280
Okay.

3898
02:38:11,281 --> 02:38:12,415
I'm gonna place
Margaret down here.

3899
02:38:12,416 --> 02:38:15,317
I just want you to take a
moment to watch Margaret.

3900
02:38:15,318 --> 02:38:16,718
All right.

3901
02:38:16,719 --> 02:38:18,020
And you can feel
free to pick her up.

3902
02:38:18,021 --> 02:38:19,855
She's really well behaved.

3903
02:38:19,856 --> 02:38:21,657
She's honestly one
of our favorites.

3904
02:38:21,658 --> 02:38:22,792
- [Woman] Okay.

3905
02:38:22,793 --> 02:38:25,827
- So how would you describe
Margaret's personality?

3906
02:38:25,828 --> 02:38:28,764
- A little erratic right now.

3907
02:38:28,765 --> 02:38:30,699
But I think if I pick
her up, she calms down.

3908
02:38:30,700 --> 02:38:31,967
- [Michael] Notice
how the subject

3909
02:38:31,968 --> 02:38:34,136
has already
anthropomorphized the object

3910
02:38:34,137 --> 02:38:35,804
referring to it as she.

3911
02:38:35,805 --> 02:38:37,706
- Maybe she feeds off my energy.

3912
02:38:37,707 --> 02:38:39,708
- Could be.

3913
02:38:39,709 --> 02:38:42,044
- Go towards the light,
go towards the middle.

3914
02:38:42,045 --> 02:38:43,812
- [Michael] Do you think
Margaret likes you?

3915
02:38:43,813 --> 02:38:44,646
- Yeah.

3916
02:38:44,647 --> 02:38:46,582
Maybe that's why
she's doing this.

3917
02:38:46,583 --> 02:38:50,218
And maybe when I go like that
she doesn't act or all eratic.

3918
02:38:50,219 --> 02:38:51,219
- That's Aaron.

3919
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:52,754
- Hi, Aaron.

3920
02:38:52,755 --> 02:38:54,256
- He can be a bit of a pistol.

3921
02:38:54,257 --> 02:38:55,691
- No way.

3922
02:38:55,692 --> 02:38:59,795
- Yes, it really depends
on who's holding him.

3923
02:38:59,796 --> 02:39:01,363
(laughing)

3924
02:39:01,364 --> 02:39:03,365
Oh, yeah, he's got
a lot of energy.

3925
02:39:03,366 --> 02:39:04,866
Aaron.

3926
02:39:04,867 --> 02:39:06,702
Hi.

3927
02:39:06,703 --> 02:39:08,236
- [Michael] Now that you've
interacted with Eli a bit more,

3928
02:39:08,237 --> 02:39:10,772
how would you describe
his personality?

3929
02:39:10,773 --> 02:39:11,740
- Oh, he's just nervous.

3930
02:39:11,741 --> 02:39:13,809
He's scared, he doesn't
know what's going on.

3931
02:39:13,810 --> 02:39:14,744
- Hey, Joe.

3932
02:39:14,745 --> 02:39:16,211
- Will these subjects
be just as willing

3933
02:39:16,212 --> 02:39:17,746
to smash their bugs?

3934
02:39:17,747 --> 02:39:22,217
Amy, I'm gonna place
Margaret right here.

3935
02:39:22,218 --> 02:39:25,754
And then I would like for
you to take this mallet.

3936
02:39:25,755 --> 02:39:28,824
And I'd like you to smash it.

3937
02:39:28,825 --> 02:39:29,858
- No.

3938
02:39:29,859 --> 02:39:33,195
I don't wanna hurt it.

3939
02:39:33,196 --> 02:39:40,869
- Just take this
mallet and smash Aaron.

3940
02:39:40,870 --> 02:39:42,904
I'm gonna ask you
to take this mallet,

3941
02:39:42,905 --> 02:39:47,809
and I'd like for
you to smash it.

3942
02:39:47,810 --> 02:39:49,911
- Smash him?

3943
02:39:49,912 --> 02:39:50,846
Hit it.

3944
02:39:50,847 --> 02:39:52,314
- Chris.

3945
02:39:52,315 --> 02:39:53,248
- Do you want me to kill Joe?

3946
02:39:53,249 --> 02:39:56,785
- [Michael] Please smash Joe.

3947
02:39:56,786 --> 02:39:59,221
- Joe, I'm sorry.

3948
02:39:59,222 --> 02:40:10,766
Oh Joe, Joe!

3949
02:40:10,767 --> 02:40:15,203
And how did it feel
to smash Aaron?

3950
02:40:15,204 --> 02:40:18,840
- It didn't feel good.

3951
02:40:18,841 --> 02:40:21,977
after spending time with
him and getting to know him.

3952
02:40:21,978 --> 02:40:23,211
Even though it's lifeless

3953
02:40:23,212 --> 02:40:25,847
and doesn't have
a mind of its own,

3954
02:40:25,848 --> 02:40:26,982
instantly, I grew
attached to it.

3955
02:40:26,983 --> 02:40:29,885
Because when I put it in
my hand, I felt its energy.

3956
02:40:29,886 --> 02:40:30,919
- I'm sorry, Joe.

3957
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:32,020
- Do you feel bad?

3958
02:40:32,021 --> 02:40:36,091
- I do, I do feel bad about
Joe, he's pretty cool.

3959
02:40:36,092 --> 02:40:37,726
- He's back.

3960
02:40:37,727 --> 02:40:40,762
- He's back!

3961
02:40:40,763 --> 02:40:41,997
- Would you smash him again

3962
02:40:41,998 --> 02:40:43,732
to make sure he
doesn't come back?

3963
02:40:43,733 --> 02:40:44,800
(laughing)

3964
02:40:44,801 --> 02:40:45,434
- No.

3965
02:40:45,435 --> 02:40:46,735
- Why not?

3966
02:40:46,736 --> 02:40:47,903
- He survived, he
survived it once.

3967
02:40:47,904 --> 02:40:49,071
I'm not gonna

3968
02:40:49,072 --> 02:40:50,372
do it again.

3969
02:40:50,373 --> 02:40:51,507
- [Michael] Clearly,
it doesn't take much

3970
02:40:51,508 --> 02:40:55,844
for humans to become emotionally
attached to technology.

3971
02:40:55,845 --> 02:40:59,748
But after my 10 days
of video gaming, nice.

3972
02:40:59,749 --> 02:41:01,850
I was about to find
out if technology

3973
02:41:01,851 --> 02:41:07,389
had affected my spatial
memory and my physical brain.

3974
02:41:07,390 --> 02:41:09,357
All right, it's been 10 days.

3975
02:41:09,358 --> 02:41:11,193
- Exactly, so we're gonna
look at the difference

3976
02:41:11,194 --> 02:41:13,261
between your test 10 days ago

3977
02:41:13,262 --> 02:41:16,098
and your test now to see
do we see any change?

3978
02:41:16,099 --> 02:41:17,365
- First, I had to retake

3979
02:41:17,366 --> 02:41:19,501
the object recognition
memory test

3980
02:41:19,502 --> 02:41:21,837
and the Morris water maze task,

3981
02:41:21,838 --> 02:41:24,272
both of which had been
revised with different content

3982
02:41:24,273 --> 02:41:25,941
than they had the last time.

3983
02:41:25,942 --> 02:41:27,175
I think I did better.

3984
02:41:27,176 --> 02:41:28,977
- Well, Dane and I will
analyze all this data

3985
02:41:28,978 --> 02:41:30,746
see how you did, but now,

3986
02:41:30,747 --> 02:41:31,980
we gotta go back to
the full size maze.

3987
02:41:31,981 --> 02:41:36,852
(ubpeat music)

3988
02:41:36,853 --> 02:41:39,454
So we've got a new maze,
tore down the old one

3989
02:41:39,455 --> 02:41:42,390
built a new one to
try to be ISO morphic.

3990
02:41:42,391 --> 02:41:45,093
So it has sort of the
same level of difficulty,

3991
02:41:45,094 --> 02:41:46,928
the same number
of choice points,

3992
02:41:46,929 --> 02:41:49,931
the same number of turns,
the same total distance

3993
02:41:49,932 --> 02:41:53,301
to each one of the objects to
try to have a similar maze,

3994
02:41:53,302 --> 02:41:54,770
but that's new.

3995
02:41:54,771 --> 02:41:55,937
Three,

3996
02:41:55,938 --> 02:41:56,772
two,

3997
02:41:56,773 --> 02:41:57,405
one,

3998
02:41:57,406 --> 02:41:58,907
go.

3999
02:41:58,908 --> 02:42:00,942
- Right around here
we got a bonds eye.

4000
02:42:00,943 --> 02:42:03,812
As before I was given five
minutes to familiarize myself

4001
02:42:03,813 --> 02:42:06,815
with the maze and where
the new objects were.

4002
02:42:06,816 --> 02:42:09,084
Now this is where I was
before I hugged that wall.

4003
02:42:09,085 --> 02:42:11,186
So if I hug the
second right wall

4004
02:42:11,187 --> 02:42:13,822
and stay all the
way right, a vase.

4005
02:42:13,823 --> 02:42:15,891
Was my hippocampus
working better?

4006
02:42:15,892 --> 02:42:18,093
At this point, it
was hard to tell.

4007
02:42:18,094 --> 02:42:19,828
- 30 seconds.

4008
02:42:19,829 --> 02:42:21,963
- I'm not even sure
I've discovered

4009
02:42:21,964 --> 02:42:23,965
all the objects hidden here.

4010
02:42:23,966 --> 02:42:25,567
- [Dr. Stark] And time.

4011
02:42:25,568 --> 02:42:27,169
- [Michael] Then my test began.

4012
02:42:27,170 --> 02:42:28,937
- First object is
a rubber duck, go.

4013
02:42:28,938 --> 02:42:31,473
- The rubber duck
was way over here.

4014
02:42:31,474 --> 02:42:32,841
(laughing)

4015
02:42:32,842 --> 02:42:34,109
How you like that?

4016
02:42:34,110 --> 02:42:35,043
Got a duck.

4017
02:42:35,044 --> 02:42:37,012
- Second item, is the hat go.

4018
02:42:37,013 --> 02:42:39,214
- With this maze, I found
myself instinctively

4019
02:42:39,215 --> 02:42:40,882
using a different approach.

4020
02:42:40,883 --> 02:42:42,350
Top hat

4021
02:42:42,351 --> 02:42:44,352
instead of thinking of the
overall geography of the maze,

4022
02:42:44,353 --> 02:42:45,387
like I did last time.

4023
02:42:45,388 --> 02:42:48,456
This time I was remembering
specific details.

4024
02:42:48,457 --> 02:42:51,893
Second, right of
the turn, got it.

4025
02:42:51,894 --> 02:42:54,529
Literally recalling
certain corners, turns

4026
02:42:54,530 --> 02:42:55,597
and straightaways.

4027
02:42:55,598 --> 02:42:56,865
Bonsai.

4028
02:42:56,866 --> 02:42:58,066
- [Dr. Clemenson]
Now, blue base.

4029
02:42:58,067 --> 02:43:00,402
- Oh, wow, it's
actually a cool vase.

4030
02:43:00,403 --> 02:43:03,338
But would this improves
my overall performance?

4031
02:43:03,339 --> 02:43:05,173
Got your backpack.
- All right.

4032
02:43:05,174 --> 02:43:06,107
(laughing)

4033
02:43:06,108 --> 02:43:07,342
So we've gotten all the objects.

4034
02:43:07,343 --> 02:43:08,844
But of course, we have
another memory test

4035
02:43:08,845 --> 02:43:10,579
that we're gonna do here.

4036
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:12,981
We're gonna go around to
the other side of the maze

4037
02:43:12,982 --> 02:43:14,149
and test your memory from there.

4038
02:43:14,150 --> 02:43:15,483
- All right.
- So your first sequence

4039
02:43:15,484 --> 02:43:17,919
is the blue seahorse,
the flashlight,

4040
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:20,322
the rubber duck and
the bonsai tree, go.

4041
02:43:20,323 --> 02:43:21,590
(upbeat music)

4042
02:43:21,591 --> 02:43:22,758
- [Michael] With the
multiple item tasks.

4043
02:43:22,759 --> 02:43:25,560
Even though I was working
from the opposite entrance,

4044
02:43:25,561 --> 02:43:28,263
I continued to recall
various details of the maze,

4045
02:43:28,264 --> 02:43:30,265
which seemed to serve me well.

4046
02:43:30,266 --> 02:43:33,435
From there, it's
just a little spiral.

4047
02:43:33,436 --> 02:43:36,571
Nice.

4048
02:43:36,572 --> 02:43:37,506
- [Dr. Clemenson] All
right, your next sequence

4049
02:43:37,507 --> 02:43:40,141
is the blue vase,
the hat, the backpack

4050
02:43:40,142 --> 02:43:41,576
and the baseball glove.

4051
02:43:41,577 --> 02:43:42,510
- Did it.
- And time.

4052
02:43:42,511 --> 02:43:43,945
- [Dr. Clemenson] Awesome.

4053
02:43:43,946 --> 02:43:45,180
- So how was it?

4054
02:43:45,181 --> 02:43:47,282
- That was not as
hard as I expected,

4055
02:43:47,283 --> 02:43:49,217
It was about details.

4056
02:43:49,218 --> 02:43:53,889
I was literally thinking
Oh, okay, there's that turn,

4057
02:43:53,890 --> 02:43:54,957
and I could do
one or two things,

4058
02:43:54,958 --> 02:43:58,126
the gloves the first one,
the bonsai even before

4059
02:43:58,127 --> 02:43:59,961
I didn't even plan that at all,

4060
02:43:59,962 --> 02:44:01,296
it just kind of happened.

4061
02:44:01,297 --> 02:44:03,498
My look alikes were also
tested in the new maze.

4062
02:44:03,499 --> 02:44:05,100
Have you been
playing video games?

4063
02:44:05,101 --> 02:44:06,501
- [All] No, sir.

4064
02:44:06,502 --> 02:44:08,603
- [Michael] Again, their
non gaming condition

4065
02:44:08,604 --> 02:44:10,071
would be the control

4066
02:44:10,072 --> 02:44:14,109
with my performance
measured against theirs.

4067
02:44:14,110 --> 02:44:16,611
- All right, we're here
for scan number two.

4068
02:44:16,612 --> 02:44:18,947
- Finally, my brain
was scanned once again,

4069
02:44:18,948 --> 02:44:21,583
to determine whether any
physical changes had occurred.

4070
02:44:21,584 --> 02:44:24,619
Dr. Stark and Dr. Clemenson
would analyze the MRI

4071
02:44:24,620 --> 02:44:28,590
along with all the other data
and report their findings.

4072
02:44:28,591 --> 02:44:30,525
Did you see my cats?

4073
02:44:30,526 --> 02:44:32,327
- I did there's corn and
what's the other one?

4074
02:44:32,328 --> 02:44:33,161
- Pickle.

4075
02:44:33,162 --> 02:44:33,995
- Corn and Pickle.

4076
02:44:33,996 --> 02:44:35,196
- Pickle, pickle.

4077
02:44:35,197 --> 02:44:37,365
Pickle's the younger one.

4078
02:44:37,366 --> 02:44:38,633
But we're not here to
talk about my cats.

4079
02:44:38,634 --> 02:44:41,169
We're here to talk
about my hippocampus.

4080
02:44:41,170 --> 02:44:44,506
Memory, comes in lots
of different forms.

4081
02:44:44,507 --> 02:44:50,145
The hippocampus seems to be
very involved in spatial memory.

4082
02:44:50,146 --> 02:44:53,982
- So the hippocampus is
involved in the spatial memory.

4083
02:44:53,983 --> 02:44:57,152
And more broadly, what we
call short term memory.

4084
02:44:57,153 --> 02:44:59,387
So it's not things that you're
keeping in your head at one.

4085
02:44:59,388 --> 02:45:01,256
So if for example, you're
rehearsing phone number

4086
02:45:01,257 --> 02:45:02,490
in your head over
and over again,

4087
02:45:02,491 --> 02:45:04,092
that's what's called
working memory.

4088
02:45:04,093 --> 02:45:06,127
So it's stuff that it's
consciously in your head,

4089
02:45:06,128 --> 02:45:07,395
whereas short term memory

4090
02:45:07,396 --> 02:45:09,130
is stuff that you
just encountered.

4091
02:45:09,131 --> 02:45:10,665
So if you're thinking about

4092
02:45:10,666 --> 02:45:12,434
what you had for
breakfast this morning,

4093
02:45:12,435 --> 02:45:14,469
that's the hippocampus that
store that new information.

4094
02:45:14,470 --> 02:45:16,738
- Where I parked my car,
where I put my water bottle,

4095
02:45:16,739 --> 02:45:18,340
but like three weeks from now,

4096
02:45:18,341 --> 02:45:20,075
I might not even remember
that I drink water

4097
02:45:20,076 --> 02:45:21,042
in a bottle today.

4098
02:45:21,043 --> 02:45:22,544
- Exactly.

4099
02:45:22,545 --> 02:45:24,079
So what happens actually is
that while you're asleep,

4100
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:27,682
the hippocampus over the
course of days and weeks

4101
02:45:27,683 --> 02:45:31,453
is actually offloading its
new memories into your cortex

4102
02:45:31,454 --> 02:45:33,755
for long term storage
for long term memory,

4103
02:45:33,756 --> 02:45:37,726
and actually kind of erases

4104
02:45:37,727 --> 02:45:40,495
the recent memories that
you can store new ones.

4105
02:45:40,496 --> 02:45:42,163
- How does it
decide what to store

4106
02:45:42,164 --> 02:45:45,333
in long term memory
and what to delete?

4107
02:45:45,334 --> 02:45:49,037
- Well, it's not so
understood, actually.

4108
02:45:49,038 --> 02:45:51,539
And it's not well understood
how it even does this,

4109
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:53,742
what we know is that
when you're asleep,

4110
02:45:53,743 --> 02:45:55,710
there's hippocampal
replay what we call.

4111
02:45:55,711 --> 02:45:58,713
So let's say for example,
you have some sort of pattern

4112
02:45:58,714 --> 02:46:00,148
of activation in hippocampus

4113
02:46:00,149 --> 02:46:02,150
that we know course
bonds to your memory,

4114
02:46:02,151 --> 02:46:04,419
we can literally
see those neurons

4115
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:07,088
firing in the same pattern
when you're asleep.

4116
02:46:07,089 --> 02:46:09,257
- So does that kind of

4117
02:46:09,258 --> 02:46:12,527
explain what dreams might
be at least partially?

4118
02:46:12,528 --> 02:46:14,629
- That is one theory
for what dreams are.

4119
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:18,666
So one worry if, for example,
your hippocampus is playing

4120
02:46:18,667 --> 02:46:23,271
your new memories to your
cortex is that you might erase

4121
02:46:23,272 --> 02:46:25,407
similar memories that had
been there for a long time.

4122
02:46:25,408 --> 02:46:28,243
And again, this is not
well established science.

4123
02:46:28,244 --> 02:46:29,477
This is just one theory

4124
02:46:29,478 --> 02:46:33,081
that's emerged largely
from modeling work.

4125
02:46:33,082 --> 02:46:36,484
But one idea is like
let's say, two days ago,

4126
02:46:36,485 --> 02:46:40,488
you went to the
park with your wife.

4127
02:46:40,489 --> 02:46:42,257
But you also went to
the park with your wife,

4128
02:46:42,258 --> 02:46:43,758
let's say, a year ago,

4129
02:46:43,759 --> 02:46:45,760
and there are some
similarities there.

4130
02:46:45,761 --> 02:46:49,297
And so one idea is that dreaming
could be the reactivation

4131
02:46:49,298 --> 02:46:50,465
of those old memories
in your cortex

4132
02:46:50,466 --> 02:46:54,302
so as to basically keep them
from getting overwritten.

4133
02:46:54,303 --> 02:46:55,737
- Wow, interesting.

4134
02:46:55,738 --> 02:46:57,372
- [Daniel] Which is one theory.

4135
02:46:57,373 --> 02:46:59,507
- It's just a theory,
sure, but I like that idea.

4136
02:46:59,508 --> 02:47:02,177
And if you don't
get enough sleep,

4137
02:47:02,178 --> 02:47:03,745
your memory will be affected.

4138
02:47:03,746 --> 02:47:05,814
- Yeah, long term
memory for sure.

4139
02:47:05,815 --> 02:47:06,781
So if you're sitting for a test,

4140
02:47:06,782 --> 02:47:08,750
you really do need to sleep.

4141
02:47:08,751 --> 02:47:10,552
So that those memories can be

4142
02:47:10,553 --> 02:47:13,288
what we call consolidated
in your cortex.

4143
02:47:13,289 --> 02:47:15,657
And also, this is why you
don't remember your dreams,

4144
02:47:15,658 --> 02:47:18,626
because the thing that would
be doing the short term

4145
02:47:18,627 --> 02:47:20,628
remembering is your hippocampus.

4146
02:47:20,629 --> 02:47:22,697
But if it's playing your
memories to your cortex,

4147
02:47:22,698 --> 02:47:24,199
while your dreaming,
it's not recording

4148
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:26,501
what's happening in your cortex.

4149
02:47:26,502 --> 02:47:29,137
- Right, because it's
playing it for the cortex.

4150
02:47:29,138 --> 02:47:30,872
- Exactly, so that the direction

4151
02:47:30,873 --> 02:47:32,540
of information flow
has been reversed.

4152
02:47:32,541 --> 02:47:35,543
So normally, it's the cortex
getting sensory inputs,

4153
02:47:35,544 --> 02:47:38,313
and it goes to the hippocampus,
and that's storing it.

4154
02:47:38,314 --> 02:47:40,715
But when you're dreaming
that information flow

4155
02:47:40,716 --> 02:47:43,251
goes the other direction.

4156
02:47:43,252 --> 02:47:44,452
- Fascinating.

4157
02:47:44,453 --> 02:47:46,321
- Yeah. I mean, it's
still very theoretical.

4158
02:47:46,322 --> 02:47:49,624
because dreaming, it's a
pretty hard thing to study

4159
02:47:49,625 --> 02:47:52,227
because people aren't awake,
and you can't really test it.

4160
02:47:52,228 --> 02:47:55,530
So, a lot of this comes
from making inferences

4161
02:47:55,531 --> 02:47:59,801
from fMRI scans of
people who are asleep.

4162
02:47:59,802 --> 02:48:02,437
And also studying the effects
asleep and dreaming on memory.

4163
02:48:02,438 --> 02:48:03,671
- Just for clarity sake.

4164
02:48:03,672 --> 02:48:06,207
Are you saying that
this theory posits

4165
02:48:06,208 --> 02:48:09,244
that dreams might be
the hippocampus plane

4166
02:48:09,245 --> 02:48:11,279
memories from short
term to cortex?

4167
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:12,480
- Yes, yeah.

4168
02:48:12,481 --> 02:48:14,649
- Not cortex playing
long term memories back

4169
02:48:14,650 --> 02:48:15,717
to the hippocampus.

4170
02:48:15,718 --> 02:48:17,819
- Right, or maybe
even the cortex

4171
02:48:17,820 --> 02:48:18,854
playing old memories to itself

4172
02:48:18,855 --> 02:48:21,222
so it doesn't forget
them or get over written.

4173
02:48:21,223 --> 02:48:22,724
- Okay, could be either, right.

4174
02:48:22,725 --> 02:48:23,791
- [Daniel] Yeah, it's not
really well understood.

4175
02:48:23,792 --> 02:48:25,627
- Of course, wow, how exciting.

4176
02:48:25,628 --> 02:48:27,795
Maybe one of you out
there will become

4177
02:48:27,796 --> 02:48:30,431
the final dream conqueror

4178
02:48:30,432 --> 02:48:31,799
to answer all
questions about dreams.

4179
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:33,568
Probably not, though,
just to be honest,

4180
02:48:33,569 --> 02:48:36,738
like, it's probably a
tougher nut to crack then.

4181
02:48:36,739 --> 02:48:38,406
Or is it?

4182
02:48:38,407 --> 02:48:39,941
- I mean, neuroscience
is advancing pretty fast.

4183
02:48:39,942 --> 02:48:40,775
- Yeah.

4184
02:48:40,776 --> 02:48:42,744
- So maybe one day soon.

4185
02:48:42,745 --> 02:48:44,312
- Do you imagine
someday being like,

4186
02:48:44,313 --> 02:48:45,813
dreams used to like, be weird.

4187
02:48:45,814 --> 02:48:49,751
And people be like,
Wow, that's so crazy--

4188
02:48:49,752 --> 02:48:51,186
- I mean, there's
so much in the brain

4189
02:48:51,187 --> 02:48:53,254
that people used to
think of as mystical.

4190
02:48:53,255 --> 02:48:54,656
So I think one great example,

4191
02:48:54,657 --> 02:48:57,258
which isn't totally related
to this is epilepsy.

4192
02:48:57,259 --> 02:48:59,961
People used to think that was
being possessed by a demon

4193
02:48:59,962 --> 02:49:02,263
Whereas now we're like, how
do people ever think that?

4194
02:49:02,264 --> 02:49:03,731
- Well, I've got a dream,

4195
02:49:03,732 --> 02:49:05,333
and that dream is for us to
continue watching this episode.

4196
02:49:05,334 --> 02:49:06,267
Are you ready?
- Let's do it.

4197
02:49:06,268 --> 02:49:13,708
- Here we go.

4198
02:49:13,709 --> 02:49:16,844
I feel like my hippocampus
is a little bit bigger.

4199
02:49:16,845 --> 02:49:18,913
Yeah, actually,
no, I don't know.

4200
02:49:18,914 --> 02:49:20,315
(laughing)

4201
02:49:20,316 --> 02:49:22,717
I'm anxious to see
what your results are.

4202
02:49:22,718 --> 02:49:23,551
- I guess let's start off first

4203
02:49:23,552 --> 02:49:25,920
with the object
recognition task.

4204
02:49:25,921 --> 02:49:29,490
And it's important to know
that in our control tests,

4205
02:49:29,491 --> 02:49:32,794
without video gaming, people
do not improve on this task.

4206
02:49:32,795 --> 02:49:34,762
But your memory got better.

4207
02:49:34,763 --> 02:49:36,664
You went up by 10 points.

4208
02:49:36,665 --> 02:49:39,000
10 points is actually
20 years worth

4209
02:49:39,001 --> 02:49:41,970
of what happens to us as we age.

4210
02:49:41,971 --> 02:49:44,505
- Oh, wow, that's about
what you might see

4211
02:49:44,506 --> 02:49:46,774
in someone who's
getting really old,

4212
02:49:46,775 --> 02:49:48,376
but they might go
down by 10 point.

4213
02:49:48,377 --> 02:49:49,477
- Exactly.

4214
02:49:49,478 --> 02:49:50,645
- So the second one we did
was the virtual version

4215
02:49:50,646 --> 02:49:52,013
of the water maze task,

4216
02:49:52,014 --> 02:49:54,849
and you actually
performed 30% better

4217
02:49:54,850 --> 02:49:56,451
the second time that you did it.

4218
02:49:56,452 --> 02:49:57,885
- Aye, not bad, I could tell

4219
02:49:57,886 --> 02:50:01,256
that I was using
better strategies.

4220
02:50:01,257 --> 02:50:02,757
- Yeah.

4221
02:50:02,758 --> 02:50:06,394
- We also had the real maze,
as you know we made two mazes.

4222
02:50:06,395 --> 02:50:08,329
Despite our efforts
to try to equate them.

4223
02:50:08,330 --> 02:50:09,764
the second maze was a little bit

4224
02:50:09,765 --> 02:50:11,933
more difficult than
the first maze,

4225
02:50:11,934 --> 02:50:15,336
if we took a look at
things like how quickly

4226
02:50:15,337 --> 02:50:18,473
you got the objects,
how many errors you made

4227
02:50:18,474 --> 02:50:20,475
and we looked at the
control subject performance,

4228
02:50:20,476 --> 02:50:21,610
and pre versus post.

4229
02:50:21,611 --> 02:50:24,746
So on all of them, they
actually got a little bit slower

4230
02:50:24,747 --> 02:50:27,915
in maze two, and all that
one of them made more errors.

4231
02:50:27,916 --> 02:50:30,852
We took a look at
your performance, you
didn't get slower,

4232
02:50:30,853 --> 02:50:33,321
from maze one to two,
you actually got faster.

4233
02:50:33,322 --> 02:50:34,589
- [Michael] Really.

4234
02:50:34,590 --> 02:50:36,591
- And you made the same
exact number of errors,

4235
02:50:36,592 --> 02:50:39,761
so they don't
improve, and you did.

4236
02:50:39,762 --> 02:50:41,796
And even though this experiment

4237
02:50:41,797 --> 02:50:43,765
had a small number of subjects,

4238
02:50:43,766 --> 02:50:45,700
the results are
really consistent

4239
02:50:45,701 --> 02:50:48,903
with our virtual maze,
study with 70 test subjects.

4240
02:50:48,904 --> 02:50:51,973
- Thank you video games,
what about inside my brain?

4241
02:50:51,974 --> 02:50:54,442
- Inside your brain, it's a
little tougher to really tell,

4242
02:50:54,443 --> 02:50:57,812
we would expect that
any effect of this

4243
02:50:57,813 --> 02:50:59,447
is going to be small.

4244
02:50:59,448 --> 02:51:00,848
I mean, we couldn't
take your hippocampus

4245
02:51:00,849 --> 02:51:02,583
and make it twice as big,

4246
02:51:02,584 --> 02:51:04,786
because then it would have to
be pushing something else out.

4247
02:51:04,787 --> 02:51:08,489
So it's just not going
to be a large change.

4248
02:51:08,490 --> 02:51:09,924
So where we did
find a difference

4249
02:51:09,925 --> 02:51:12,360
is actually in the shape
of the hippocampus,

4250
02:51:12,361 --> 02:51:15,797
what we saw is there were some
regions in the hippocampus

4251
02:51:15,798 --> 02:51:18,800
on both sides that appeared
to have changed shape

4252
02:51:18,801 --> 02:51:22,470
from day one before gaming
to day 10, after gaming.

4253
02:51:22,471 --> 02:51:25,440
- What's really surprising
to me is that as an adult,

4254
02:51:25,441 --> 02:51:27,342
my brain is still changing,

4255
02:51:27,343 --> 02:51:29,777
that makes me wanna take
better care of my brain.

4256
02:51:29,778 --> 02:51:31,012
Exercise it more,

4257
02:51:31,013 --> 02:51:33,014
because it is a thing
that can change it.

4258
02:51:33,015 --> 02:51:37,785
So I'm not just stuck with
what I have now, today.

4259
02:51:37,786 --> 02:51:41,089
- I mean, in all of this, I
think that the big takeaway

4260
02:51:41,090 --> 02:51:45,093
is that doing things, giving
your brain something to learn,

4261
02:51:45,094 --> 02:51:48,863
something to do,
something to figure out,

4262
02:51:48,864 --> 02:51:52,567
this is what we think
is actually keeping
your brain sharp.

4263
02:51:52,568 --> 02:51:54,402
- One way to do that is to
keep watching Mind Field.

4264
02:51:54,403 --> 02:51:55,136
- [Dr. Stark] Exactly.

4265
02:51:55,137 --> 02:51:55,970
(laughing)

4266
02:51:55,971 --> 02:52:01,743
(upbeat music)

4267
02:52:01,744 --> 02:52:05,146
- As our relationship
with technology
becomes ever stronger,

4268
02:52:05,147 --> 02:52:06,614
people are bound to worry

4269
02:52:06,615 --> 02:52:08,850
about what it will
do to our brains,

4270
02:52:08,851 --> 02:52:11,152
will offloading
memory and computing

4271
02:52:11,153 --> 02:52:13,988
to our machines make us dumber?

4272
02:52:13,989 --> 02:52:18,092
Will our empathy for machines
have negative consequences

4273
02:52:18,093 --> 02:52:21,629
for how we interact
with each other?

4274
02:52:21,630 --> 02:52:24,132
Well, let's look
back to another time,

4275
02:52:24,133 --> 02:52:26,167
a new kind of
technology threatened

4276
02:52:26,168 --> 02:52:28,736
to fundamentally
change our brains.

4277
02:52:28,737 --> 02:52:30,605
Two and a half
thousand years ago,

4278
02:52:30,606 --> 02:52:32,740
the Greek philosopher
Socrates worried

4279
02:52:32,741 --> 02:52:34,742
that the wide use of writing

4280
02:52:34,743 --> 02:52:37,712
would have a negative
impact on people's minds.

4281
02:52:37,713 --> 02:52:40,848
He said that writing would
to quote his student Plato,

4282
02:52:40,849 --> 02:52:42,583
create forgetfulness,

4283
02:52:42,584 --> 02:52:44,819
because people will
not use their memories,

4284
02:52:44,820 --> 02:52:47,755
they will trust the
external written characters

4285
02:52:47,756 --> 02:52:50,725
and not remember themselves.

4286
02:52:50,726 --> 02:52:52,059
Socrates was right.

4287
02:52:52,060 --> 02:52:55,630
Written language did
fundamentally change our brains.

4288
02:52:55,631 --> 02:52:57,732
But it's also one
of the cornerstones

4289
02:52:57,733 --> 02:53:00,501
of everything modern
civilization has accomplished.

4290
02:53:00,502 --> 02:53:03,204
One of the defining
characteristics of being human

4291
02:53:03,205 --> 02:53:06,541
is that this is not the
boundary of my body.

4292
02:53:06,542 --> 02:53:10,178
And this is not the
boundary of my mind.

4293
02:53:10,179 --> 02:53:16,083
And as always,
thanks for watching.

4294
02:53:16,084 --> 02:53:17,852
There you go.

4295
02:53:17,853 --> 02:53:21,088
Episode is over,
how do you feel?

4296
02:53:21,089 --> 02:53:23,658
- I feel good about it.

4297
02:53:23,659 --> 02:53:26,060
I liked what we covered
about the hippocampus

4298
02:53:26,061 --> 02:53:29,730
and kind of getting at that
slightly counter intuitive idea

4299
02:53:29,731 --> 02:53:31,899
that the hippocampus is
not just short term memory,

4300
02:53:31,900 --> 02:53:35,102
but also spatial memory
and spatial navigation

4301
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:36,737
and how in our own cognition,

4302
02:53:36,738 --> 02:53:38,539
those two are very
tied together.

4303
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:39,607
- Whoo, right.

4304
02:53:39,608 --> 02:53:41,876
You had mentioned earlier
about memory palaces?

4305
02:53:41,877 --> 02:53:43,110
- Yeah, yeah.

4306
02:53:43,111 --> 02:53:44,812
So have you ever
watched Sherlock?

4307
02:53:44,813 --> 02:53:46,247
- I love Sherlock,

4308
02:53:46,248 --> 02:53:47,915
I've written plenty of
fanfiction about that show.

4309
02:53:47,916 --> 02:53:50,751
- There is this recurring
trope in the show where he goes

4310
02:53:50,752 --> 02:53:52,987
into I think he calls it
his memory palace, right?

4311
02:53:52,988 --> 02:53:53,821
- Right. Right, right.

4312
02:53:53,822 --> 02:53:55,223
- Memory palaces comes

4313
02:53:55,224 --> 02:53:59,026
from this very ancient
memorization technique,

4314
02:53:59,027 --> 02:54:03,130
that's actually it's been
used since ancient Greece,

4315
02:54:03,131 --> 02:54:06,667
where I think they call
it the method of low side.

4316
02:54:06,668 --> 02:54:08,769
And the reason it works.

4317
02:54:08,770 --> 02:54:11,172
So I should explain the
method is basically,

4318
02:54:11,173 --> 02:54:15,176
you imagine some two dimensional
three dimensional space

4319
02:54:15,177 --> 02:54:17,778
that you're familiar
with, like your house,

4320
02:54:17,779 --> 02:54:20,715
and you place an
object to be remembered

4321
02:54:20,716 --> 02:54:22,817
in different locations
in the house.

4322
02:54:22,818 --> 02:54:25,019
So for example, let's say
you walk into the kitchen.

4323
02:54:25,020 --> 02:54:28,556
So in the kitchen, there's
these set of facts,

4324
02:54:28,557 --> 02:54:29,290
and you go into your bedroom.

4325
02:54:29,291 --> 02:54:30,458
And there's these set of facts.

4326
02:54:30,459 --> 02:54:33,561
And the reason this works
is because your hippocampus

4327
02:54:33,562 --> 02:54:37,732
is very spatial, it organizes
information spatially.

4328
02:54:37,733 --> 02:54:41,836
And this actually has an
impact on our cognition.

4329
02:54:41,837 --> 02:54:45,773
So it's also involved in, for
example, our sense of time,

4330
02:54:45,774 --> 02:54:47,241
which is tied to
our sense of space.

4331
02:54:47,242 --> 02:54:50,578
So do you ever like
walk into a new room

4332
02:54:50,579 --> 02:54:51,913
and then you forget
why you're there?

4333
02:54:51,914 --> 02:54:53,147
- Oh, totally, yeah.

4334
02:54:53,148 --> 02:54:54,582
- That's because of
your hippocampus,

4335
02:54:54,583 --> 02:54:57,184
your hippocampus, tied
that mental context

4336
02:54:57,185 --> 02:55:00,621
and certain memories to
the room you're in before,

4337
02:55:00,622 --> 02:55:01,889
now you walk into a new room,

4338
02:55:01,890 --> 02:55:03,991
you're in a new spatial context,

4339
02:55:03,992 --> 02:55:07,228
and that context isn't
attached to this memory.

4340
02:55:07,229 --> 02:55:09,297
- Wow!

4341
02:55:09,298 --> 02:55:10,498
Fascinating, yeah.

4342
02:55:10,499 --> 02:55:13,834
Because it's always kind of
you realize that you don't know

4343
02:55:13,835 --> 02:55:15,269
why you're there
at the same moment

4344
02:55:15,270 --> 02:55:16,871
that you realize you're there.

4345
02:55:16,872 --> 02:55:18,806
Then you're like,
all right, new place,

4346
02:55:18,807 --> 02:55:20,942
and we lost everything
that was associated

4347
02:55:20,943 --> 02:55:23,277
with the last place, didn't
we shoot, why am I here?

4348
02:55:23,278 --> 02:55:26,113
- Yep, and there's
also research,

4349
02:55:26,114 --> 02:55:28,015
showing that this can
warp your sense of time.

4350
02:55:28,016 --> 02:55:30,818
So this actually research I did

4351
02:55:30,819 --> 02:55:32,820
back when I was an undergrad,

4352
02:55:32,821 --> 02:55:35,756
on how the hippocampus
and other related regions,

4353
02:55:35,757 --> 02:55:38,859
they encode our sense
of the passage of time,

4354
02:55:38,860 --> 02:55:41,095
or at least our memory for
how much time has passed.

4355
02:55:41,096 --> 02:55:45,099
And so if you constantly
switch context,

4356
02:55:45,100 --> 02:55:47,935
for example, by changing rooms,
or even changing the kinds

4357
02:55:47,936 --> 02:55:49,604
of things you're thinking about,

4358
02:55:49,605 --> 02:55:51,906
you're gonna remember more
time as having passed.

4359
02:55:51,907 --> 02:55:53,808
- Huh, interesting.

4360
02:55:53,809 --> 02:55:54,676
Really?

4361
02:55:54,677 --> 02:55:55,677
- Yeah, and you
can manipulate this

4362
02:55:55,678 --> 02:55:57,678
by even having someone
walk into a new room,

4363
02:55:57,679 --> 02:55:59,647
which is a way of
changing context.

4364
02:55:59,648 --> 02:56:02,383
- Right, and so they will
think that it's been longer.

4365
02:56:02,384 --> 02:56:04,151
- They'll remember, more
time as having past.

4366
02:56:04,152 --> 02:56:06,687
So your memory of time passing

4367
02:56:06,688 --> 02:56:09,190
isn't exactly the same as
your current experience

4368
02:56:09,191 --> 02:56:10,391
of time passing.

4369
02:56:10,392 --> 02:56:11,659
- Of course, yeah, I
couldn't feel like man,

4370
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:14,028
this is so boring, later on.

4371
02:56:14,029 --> 02:56:15,730
I basically feel
like it took a second

4372
02:56:15,731 --> 02:56:18,032
because I've got so few
memories from there.

4373
02:56:18,033 --> 02:56:20,368
That's what it was like
being in isolation,

4374
02:56:20,369 --> 02:56:22,870
in season one episode
one of Mind Field.

4375
02:56:22,871 --> 02:56:26,407
I have like, no memories
from those three days,

4376
02:56:26,408 --> 02:56:27,942
because nothing happened,

4377
02:56:27,943 --> 02:56:30,044
I just stared at
white walls all day.

4378
02:56:30,045 --> 02:56:32,213
- And how do you
remember time passing

4379
02:56:32,214 --> 02:56:34,148
when you were in there?

4380
02:56:34,149 --> 02:56:36,917
- It didn't pass, that
was the other weird thing.

4381
02:56:36,918 --> 02:56:39,887
There's this whole soliloquy
I gave halfway through,

4382
02:56:39,888 --> 02:56:42,857
I believe my stay in that room
that isn't in the episode.

4383
02:56:42,858 --> 02:56:45,092
But it was something like, wow,

4384
02:56:45,093 --> 02:56:46,794
I'm not even scared
of death anymore.

4385
02:56:46,795 --> 02:56:48,162
Because there's nothing
to look forward to

4386
02:56:48,163 --> 02:56:49,363
every moment is the same.

4387
02:56:49,364 --> 02:56:53,034
I wonder if this is how a bug
feels that you just exist,

4388
02:56:53,035 --> 02:56:54,902
and there's now and
that's all there is.

4389
02:56:54,903 --> 02:56:58,673
And so death isn't scary.

4390
02:56:58,674 --> 02:57:00,007
It was a crazy experiment.

4391
02:57:00,008 --> 02:57:01,909
- A data bug would be
having those though.

4392
02:57:01,910 --> 02:57:03,944
- I know, I know but
I'm just thinking,

4393
02:57:03,945 --> 02:57:05,446
what is the
consciousness of a bug?

4394
02:57:05,447 --> 02:57:08,749
Like if it exists, and it might
not plan for the future much

4395
02:57:08,750 --> 02:57:10,885
It might not
remember how long ago

4396
02:57:10,886 --> 02:57:13,020
it did that other
thing in the past.

4397
02:57:13,021 --> 02:57:16,891
So it's just kind of the
world exists right now.

4398
02:57:16,892 --> 02:57:19,427
But yeah, because I have
no memories from that.

4399
02:57:19,428 --> 02:57:20,595
It just felt like it
happened like this.

4400
02:57:20,596 --> 02:57:23,764
But if I look at what I've
done in the last three days,

4401
02:57:23,765 --> 02:57:25,366
especially now as a new dad,

4402
02:57:25,367 --> 02:57:29,103
it feels like that's
so much time passed

4403
02:57:29,104 --> 02:57:31,439
forever has passed,
since three days ago.

4404
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:32,907
- Yep.

4405
02:57:32,908 --> 02:57:35,476
So we actually did, this
wasn't the hippocampus,

4406
02:57:35,477 --> 02:57:37,278
but it was a region
right next to it

4407
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:39,880
called the internal cortex,
which is kind of the,

4408
02:57:39,881 --> 02:57:42,149
that's

4409
02:57:42,150 --> 02:57:43,417
the part of the cortex

4410
02:57:43,418 --> 02:57:45,953
that feeds information
into the hippocampus.

4411
02:57:45,954 --> 02:57:49,090
So we looked at how
activity there predicts

4412
02:57:49,091 --> 02:57:51,025
people sense or memory
for time passing.

4413
02:57:51,026 --> 02:57:53,894
And so what we did is we
put people in the scanner,

4414
02:57:53,895 --> 02:57:56,330
and they listened
to a short story.

4415
02:57:56,331 --> 02:57:58,899
And after they left the scanner,

4416
02:57:58,900 --> 02:58:00,901
we then would play two
clips from the story

4417
02:58:00,902 --> 02:58:02,269
and we asked them how
much time do remember

4418
02:58:02,270 --> 02:58:05,106
passing between
clip A and clip B?

4419
02:58:05,107 --> 02:58:07,341
And what we found was
the more activity changed

4420
02:58:07,342 --> 02:58:10,144
in their internal
cortex in that period,

4421
02:58:10,145 --> 02:58:13,481
the more time they remembered
passing between those two.

4422
02:58:13,482 --> 02:58:14,915
- Wow, fascinating.

4423
02:58:14,916 --> 02:58:16,784
- The idea being literally

4424
02:58:16,785 --> 02:58:20,755
there was more stuff changing
in their head, in that period.

4425
02:58:20,756 --> 02:58:22,389
- So the perception
of time passing,

4426
02:58:22,390 --> 02:58:24,959
the memory of time
passing, dreams,

4427
02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:27,995
we've got a lot of
material for a season four,

4428
02:58:27,996 --> 02:58:29,764
what do you say YouTube?

4429
02:58:29,765 --> 02:58:30,898
(laughing)

4430
02:58:30,899 --> 02:58:32,066
- All about the hippocampus,

4431
02:58:32,067 --> 02:58:33,868
- All about them, I would
love to do a themed season.

4432
02:58:33,869 --> 02:58:35,803
Just every episode
is about fear,

4433
02:58:35,804 --> 02:58:38,239
or every episode is
about the hippocampus.

4434
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:41,075
Or the cerebellum, I don't care.

4435
02:58:41,076 --> 02:58:42,309
But there's a lot of
cool stuff out there.

4436
02:58:42,310 --> 02:58:44,245
And Daniel, it's always
a pleasure to have you

4437
02:58:44,246 --> 02:58:45,813
come and share
all of your ideas.

4438
02:58:45,814 --> 02:58:46,914
Thanks for joining--
- Always fun to be here.

4439
02:58:46,915 --> 02:58:53,254
- That concludes our Mind
Field marathon, for now.

4440
02:58:53,255 --> 02:58:53,921
Will there be a
second installment?

4441
02:58:53,922 --> 02:58:55,456
I hope so.

4442
02:58:55,457 --> 02:58:58,292
So many incredibly talented
people worked on this show.

4443
02:58:58,293 --> 02:58:59,360
I couldn't have done
it without them.

4444
02:58:59,361 --> 02:59:00,995
You met some of them today.

4445
02:59:00,996 --> 02:59:04,465
I'm so grateful to their
intelligence and their knowledge

4446
02:59:04,466 --> 02:59:07,468
and their passion for teaching.

4447
02:59:07,469 --> 02:59:08,903
If you haven't seen every
episode of Mind Field yet,

4448
02:59:08,904 --> 02:59:10,437
please go check them out.

4449
02:59:10,438 --> 02:59:12,439
Right now they are free to
view all around the world.

4450
02:59:12,440 --> 02:59:15,543
There's 24 of them, there's
playlist on my channel,

4451
02:59:15,544 --> 02:59:18,445
check them all out, I
recommend all of them.

4452
02:59:18,446 --> 02:59:21,182
The mind is a wonderful place.

4453
02:59:21,183 --> 02:59:23,117
A wonderful field.

4454
02:59:23,118 --> 02:59:25,052
It's sometimes scary
as a Mind Field.

4455
02:59:25,053 --> 02:59:27,087
Any who, you know the name
of the show, go check it out.

4456
02:59:27,088 --> 02:59:30,224
And as always,
thanks for watching.

4457
02:59:30,225 --> 02:59:36,197
(upbeat music)

4458
02:59:36,198 --> 02:59:38,265
That was a blast.

4459
02:59:38,266 --> 02:59:40,968
I hope you had as
much fun as I did.

4460
02:59:40,969 --> 02:59:41,969
Because you're still watching

4461
02:59:41,970 --> 02:59:43,604
I got a little bit of a
secret to show you okay,

4462
02:59:43,605 --> 02:59:46,540
this remote I was
using the whole time.

4463
02:59:46,541 --> 02:59:47,908
doesn't even have
batteries in it.

4464
02:59:47,909 --> 02:59:49,310
(laughing)

4465
02:59:49,311 --> 02:59:51,612
Hollywood magic, everything
is smoke and mirrors

4466
02:59:51,613 --> 02:59:55,149
except Mind Field, it's
a very serious show

4467
02:59:55,150 --> 02:59:56,383
I'm very proud of it.

4468
02:59:56,384 --> 02:59:58,586

4469
02:59:58,587 --> 02:59:59,887
