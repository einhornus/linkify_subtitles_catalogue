1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,028
Star Wars splatter art and a t-shirt commemorating
one of history's most lapidary quotes.

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:12,779
It's episode 25 of LÃœT.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,098
Navigate the web with glow-in-the-dark mouse

4
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:20,479
containing an actual spider.
And you can use a straw to drink juice right

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,339
out of a fruit, but this hand juicer turns
a fruit into a spray bottle for all your favourite

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,009
dishes.
Now go buy some top hats for your cat and

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,919
toast his style with a frothy beer that's
always foamy.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,959
Japan Trend Shop brings us a gadget that with
a single click sends a rush of new bubbles

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,319
to the top.
You can say "I love you" in binary and then

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,979
snuggle up with your custom-made pillows.
PillowMob lets you upload a photo, crop it,

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,648
colour it, edit it and then receive a nice,
soft, cuddly, high-quality pillow, which is

12
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:01,269
apparently made by cats...?
Well, Neatoshop offers a unicorn-shaped pencil

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:08,719
sharpener, a beanie that makes you look like
a gory zombie, a soft, plush salami, ouchlets

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,759
for safety and a Tommy gun shaped purse.
I guess to carry around your spy video camera.

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,859
But you could be even more secret with a spy
camera hidden inside what looks like a phone

16
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,849
charger.
Evolution in New York sells a cute, stylised

17
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,829
tiger rug.
But if you have $3,000 and want a real animal

18
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,429
rug, they've got black bears, wolves and I'm
not kidding, zebras.

19
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,328
For a cool $12,000 you can get this.
Seriously.

20
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,798
I'm not lying.
Less real, but still macabre is this hollowed-out

21
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,798
skull USB hub.
You get 4 more ports and a skullball to keep

22
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,529
your stuff.
Similarly skeletory are these leg bones knee-high

23
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,959
socks, also available shorter, and Sock Theory
also has ones that lace up.

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,069
Happy socks and Converse shoes... socks.
Luna & Curious' animal mugs render each animal

25
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,668
half as a handle.
But if you're more interested in this end,

26
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,719
here's a coffee mug with a built-in secret.
As you sip away the Java, you reveal a perfect

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,269
little pile of poo.
When it comes poo at the office, avoid awkward

28
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,749
dumps next to your boss or dropped toilet
paper with this handy survival guide.

29
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,979
But in a worse-case scenario, make sure you've
got an emergency underpants dispenser.

30
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,488
Now, speaking of bathrooms, they are more
fun with giant googly eyes.

31
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,458
You can put these things on anything.
And they may not have meant it ironically,

32
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,419
but this book proves that dads are the original hipsters.

33
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,208
Of course, those gnomes and pink flamingos
they've got today... buy yourself a zombie

34
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:51,109
version for your own lawn.
And enjoy the sweetness of a 20-sided sucker.

35
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:57,479
The only luxury items more soothing are these
tequila ice pops, filled with real edible

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,759
gold flakes.
Now, your body can't really digest gold, so

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,639
save money and collect the flakes back after
sitting on your truck-hitched toilet seat-on-the-go.

38
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,568
In fact, why ever stop sitting?
These lazy football chairs let you try your

39
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,429
skills without working too hard.
Kick the ball with Kobi Levi's shark shoes

40
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,929
for him and her and illuminate the action
using a kit that helps you snap old light

41
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,749
bulbs into fun shapes around a new one.
Of course, why have real light when you can

42
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,889
have 8-bit light?
Painted on a canvas just for you.

43
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,349
Because then you can show your 8-bit life
with this necklace.

44
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:42,598
Or use one where the pendant swings on the
necklace, which is cute, but why the neck

45
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,429
a gemini?
Litter offers leg necklaces.

46
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,339
Well, they're guarder chains.
But here are some that attach to sunglasses

47
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,318
to give you a moustache.
Or a full biker beard.

48
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:02,139
Do you prefer air to metal inflatable beards,
because you can wash your body with soap containing

49
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,639
a foetus?
Look, just wash your head with some brain

50
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,589
soap.
Or brighten things up with a brain in a jar

51
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,109
candle.
You may wish to use a miniature MacBook pocket

52
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:19,319
mirror, but RedCandy has bigger ones.
The London underground, a razor blade or a

53
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,969
wiper blade to easily defog after a shower.
Oh and this one let's you compare your height

54
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,309
to celebrities.
Are you Snoop Dogg or Salvador Dali...?

55
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,649
...whose melting clocks could be yours with
this shelf clinking model.

56
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,508
It might be easier to just keep time on your
wrist with a watch made out of wood.

57
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,839
For every watch they sell the company plants a tree.

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,049
Now for your free thing, check out the wallpapers
Split Reason is offering.

59
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,299
I particularly enjoyed what the count must
see in the mirror.

60
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,099
And the simple fact that Particle physics
gives me a hadron.

61
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,339
Combine honeybees and boo to get boo-bees.

62
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,499
And always,

63
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,820
thanks for watching.
