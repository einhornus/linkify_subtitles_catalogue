00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,289
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And I'm Regent's Park

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,338
in London joined by Tom from "/Tom."

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,308
Awesome channel, check it out.
This camera belongs to Tom and Hazel

4
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:13,428
is operating it right now.
Yeah, that's her giving a thumbs up, which

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,618
I'm sure just look like a blur,
but the point is we're gonna do information today.

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,659
Right now, Tom, I'm in London.
Which is in England. And it's also in

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,819
the United Kingdom.
Which is in Europe. Okay, and we've also

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,309
got another term - Great Britain.
Well, let's unpack all these terms

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,329
and today learn about

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,419
geography.
I may have failed geography.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,898
Can I find someone else?

12
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:40,819
Now, if we're going to talk about
geography, I think we should go all the

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,139
way back to a time

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,229
when there was no geography. That's right.
Way before YouTube existed,

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,889
our solar system was nothing but a
mist of dust and gases,

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,988
what is known as a solar nebula.
But then,

17
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,679
about 4.6 billion years ago something

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,209
majestic happened.
We don't know exactly what caused it,

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,898
but some scientists believe that the
shockwave of a nearby supernova

20
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,298
hit our nebula, causing it to start spinning

21
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,118
and contracting. Now, as things collected
together, their overall gravity got

22
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,319
stronger and they pulled more stuff in it.
And boom,

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,919
we've got a Sun.
A half billion years later,

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,799
and the disk of junk circling around
the Sun starts coming together in its

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,409
own way,

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,059
into what we now call the planets.
One of these planets I've actually

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,749
visited and it's called Earth.
But before we get ahead of ourselves,

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,079
what the heck is the Moon doing there?
I mean, here's the problem. When you look at

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,839
all the terrestrial planets,
all the planets near us, near the Sun,

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,579
they all have very similar structure and
they'll have the same big metal core

31
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,359
and they all have very similar densities.
But the Moon

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,758
is very not dense.
And it doesn't have

33
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,868
a similar structure, it doesn't have a huge
dense metal core.

34
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,898
In fact when we visited them and brought
back dust and rocks to analyze what the

35
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:56,978
Moon was made out of,

36
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,469
we found that the Moon was made out of
the same stuff that you find in

37
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,878
Earth's crust and mantle but not Earth's

38
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,648
core. This discovery gave rise to a
pretty awesome idea

39
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,219
that the moon is actually made out of
what used to be

40
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,249
on Earth.
About 4.52

41
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,769
billion years ago there used to be
another planet

42
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,149
called Theia. It was a little bit smaller
than Mars but it had an unfortunate

43
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,568
orbit. It was fine for millions of years
but eventually and

44
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,878
what did happen to it was that it
collided with Earth.

45
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,139
Now, it's believed that
the collision happened quite slowly

46
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,169
and the centers, the cores of both Theia and Earth

47
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,579
fused into one. And material from the
mantle and crust of Earth

48
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,799
wasn't just scattered
but it was forcefully ejected,

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,229
literally launched into outer space.
It circled around

50
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,529
Earth and scientists believe that it took
only about a week

51
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,268
for all that Earth material out in space
to coalesce

52
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,779
into what we now call the Moon.
Oh, and by the way, if

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,108
that's how the Moon formed,
it was such a strong collision

54
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:03,708
the actual axis that the Earth spun on was tilted

55
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,119
23.5 degrees, which to this day

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,479
is why we have seasons.well

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,739
Wow.

58
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,539
Alright, so four billion years ago the
continents as we know them

59
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,438
began to emerge. You know, these pieces of
the Earth's crust that have cooled down

60
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,158
and are floating around on Earth's molten
liquid insides.

61
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,759
Now, they move and they've been in
constant motion since they began but

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,468
they move

63
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,658
very, very slowly.
Every 300 to 500 million years,

64
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,028
the continents all converge into what's called one

65
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:40,018
big supercontinent.
All the land in the entire Earth

66
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,328
altogether and the rest of it covered in
ocean. The most recent supercontinent is

67
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,449
kind of a famous, it's called

68
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,839
Pangaea. But scientists believe that there
may have been four, five, six or even more

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,559
supercontinents that existed

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,789
before Pangaea.
What's really mind-blowing

71
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,809
is the fact that eventually there's
going to be another Pangaea, another supercontinent.

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,238
And based on calculations,
the Earth at that time

73
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,809
will look like this. But like I said,
these land masses are moving very very

74
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,559
slowly

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,199
and so for that reason it is worth
learning their names

76
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,229
as they are now.
Which brings us back to the question of

77
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,588
England, United Kingdom, Great Britain,

78
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,778
British Isles and what all these terms mean.
Let's begin

79
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,388
zoomed out.
The British Isles and Ireland are a collection of

80
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,879
6 thousand islands off the coast of Europe.
The term

81
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,109
Great Britain refers to the largest
of these islands.

82
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,569
Now, Great Britain contains three
separate countries: England,

83
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,869
Wales and Scotland.
If we add Northern Ireland into the mix,

84
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,929
we're now looking at what is known as
the United Kingdom or the

85
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,129
UK. The Republic of Ireland is a
separate country that is not part

86
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,499
of the United Kingdom. And, by the way,
England is where London is

87
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,109
which is where Summer in the City was.
Which brings us back to Regent's Park.

88
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,229
And

89
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,409
as

90
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,448
always,

91
00:04:58,449 --> 00:04:59,288
thanks for

92
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:10,648
watching.

93
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:22,439
Could you guys stand still for a second?

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,959
To learn more about Great Britain,

95
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,219
Ireland, overseas territories and even Canada,

96
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,299
you really must check out CGPGrey's

97
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,849
explanation video, if you haven't seen it already.
This guy's incredible.

98
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,259
You can also check out the channels belonging to
the people who helped me with the intro

99
