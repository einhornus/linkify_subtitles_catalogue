Hello, Vsauce. Michael here,
and today I have a brand new episode

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,789
of Vsauce Leanback, a playlist that I host
made out of awesome videos from

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,879
all over YouTube.
The theme for this one is stuff

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,569
I didn't know last week, but now I do.
It's fun and you can begin at anytime by

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,849
clicking the link at the top

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,099
of this video's description. If you're on a
mobile device, it probably won't work,

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,448
so wait until you're at a computer and
then you can lean back.

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,209
In the meantime I'm gonna give you one
cool fact and four things you can do

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,669
online now guys.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,599
Alright, first the fact.
America and Europe are on

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,929
different tectonic plates and these plates
are slowly moving apart from each other,

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,339
which means that every year America and Europe

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,538
are 1 inch further apart.
You know what else grows

14
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,639
at one inch a year?
Fingernails.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,839
What's cool about that is that,
for instance if you live in America,

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,889
every time you look at your fingernails
you can think "hmmm, since the last time I

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,898
clipped these,

18
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,529
Europe is that much farther away."
Pretty neat.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,589
If you enjoy deep emotional flash games,
"veronica1095" sent me a list

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,499
of some really cool ones.
But if you prefer making your own music,

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,639
check out Qwerty Beats.
All you need to be a DJ is your mouse

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,099
and your keyboard.

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,809
If you want your mind blown by
perspective, play Adult Swim's Cardboard

24
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,438
Box

25
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,048
Assembler. This game is laid out on a
three-dimensional cube

26
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,069
and as you run around you can change what's up

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,978
and what's down. And finally, if you're one
of those people who hate Vsauce

28
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,758
Leanbacks because they're so long,

29
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,618
go check out 5secondfilms.
It's a YouTube channel

30
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,419
with 775 hilarious videos,

31
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,529
so short they're only five seconds long. And what the

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,349
H, here's a bonus.
This guy is counting to 1 billion

33
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,699
on YouTube.
One number at a time, one video

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,779
for each number. He's only up to about
200 right now, but let me give you a taste.

35
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,719
Here's a good one. 23.
Twenty-three.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,638
Nice. So, what are you waiting for?

39

Leanback.

40
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,549
And as always,

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,950
thanks for watching.
