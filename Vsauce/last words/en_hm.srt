1
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:04,319
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,439
On December 17th, 1977,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,879
Gary Gilmore was executed for murder.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,149
He was the first prisoner executed
by the United States after a

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,969
10-year suspension of the practice.
When asked if he had any

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,519
last words, he simply replied
"let's do it."

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,709
Years later, advertising executive Dan Wieden
adapted those words into

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,929
a slogan, that is now more widely known

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,449
than Gary Gilmore.
Last words

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,689
are powerful.
They are the final statement, a person's entire life has

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,889
been leading up to.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,359
One last chance to go on record
before obliteration.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,218
We don't know Albert Einstein's

14
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,259
last words.
He spoke them in German

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,599
to a nurse who only knew English,

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,779
They're lost.

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,378
But what will be

18
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,039
our first words?
The first words

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,599
from earth extraterrestrials out there
might hear from us.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,129
We have been broadcasting signals
with radio waves

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,819
wirelessly through the air for more than
one hundred years.

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,989
Under the right conditions,
those signals can leak into space

23
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,548
and keep going outward at the speed of light

24
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:29,508
through our galaxy, through the universe.
Current human technology would struggle

25
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,489
to tune into regular TV and radio broadcasts from

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,048
as near as Mars.
But perhaps other intelligent beings out there

27
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,539
would fare better and could point there
instruments at earth

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,989
and hear us.
If so, what would the

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,749
earliest thing be that they could receive?

30
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,758
Our cosmic first

31
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,819
words.
Well, the

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,328
earliest signal, robust enough to be
picked up light years away,

33
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,349
might have come from Hitler.

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,429
His 1936 broadcasting

35
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,127
of the Summer Olympics used powerful
enough radio equipment to reach

36
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,769
forty-one countries,

37
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,719
making it a contender for what listening
extraterrestrials could receive as,

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,909
to them, Earth's first words.

39
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,619
Within the last 50 years or so, broadcast signals

40
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,738
in general, have become stronger
than Hitler's Olympics

41
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,399
and are better candidates for being intercepted.

42
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,539
The earliest of them have traveled
50 light years away from Earth.

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,719
Altogether they have entertained billions of

44
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,359
people and by now about 2,000 stars.

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,969
The 133 brightest of which are shown

46
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,249
here.
So far, Martin Luther King JR's

47
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,009
"I have a dream" speech
has traveled as far as the furthest

48
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,018
on the diagram µAra, which has

49
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,409
four known planets.
In six years,

50
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,199
our first words on the Moon
will pass by µAra's

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,029
system.
"That's one small step for man,

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,639
one giant leap for mankind."
Those words were spoken by Neil

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,219
Armstrong,
seen here a few years before his death

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,119
with Eugene Cernan,
the most recent and currently

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,919
last man to have walked on the surface of the Moon.

56
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,298
On December 14th, 1972,

57
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,969
before climbing back into the lunar module,
Cernan spoke

58
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,809
our, as of today, last words on the Moon.

59
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,639
"We leave as we came and,

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,818
God willing, as we shall return, with peace,

61
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:44,568
and hope for all mankind."
Of course,

62
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,708
once inside the lunar module, the crew kept

63
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,669
talking, meaning that technically
the very last words humans have said

64
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,098
on the surface of the Moon were a
countdown spoken by Harrison

65
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:02,959
Jack Schmitt.
"Three, two, one."

66
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,179
We haven't been back to the Moon

67
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,809
since.
But hold on. What were the first words

68
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,878
spoken on the surface of the Moon

69
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,878
really?
Armstrong's giant

70
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,349
leap statement is a good answer,
but what counts as being

71
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,789
on the Moon if touchdown

72
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,819
counts? Then the first words spoken on the
Moon go not to Armstrong but to Buzz Aldrin,

73
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,559
who, on feeling at least one of the landing pads

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,159
softly settle onto the lunar soil, spoke

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,979
this immortal description:
"contact light."

76
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,679
We are pumping broadcasts in the space

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,589
as an ever expanding sphere of radio waves.

78
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,219
But here's something humbling.
Even while growing at the speed of light,

79
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,549
Earth's radio sphere is puny.

80
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,429
This is our galaxy, the Milky Way.
Comparatively,

81
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,579
the distance our radio signals, our voice

82
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:13,359
has traveled is this big.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,819
The universe is huge.

84
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,269
How the heck are you supposed
to be remembered in it?

85
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,949
Utter last words that stick around after you die?

86
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,549
Well, you may have heard
the famous quote from Banksy

87
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,609
"They say you die twice.

88
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,259
One time when you stop breathing and a second time,

89
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,739
a bit later on, when somebody says your name

90
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,169
for the last time."
But your anonymous influence continues

91
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,459
long after that, right?
I mean, people may stop saying your name,

92
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,459
but, for instance, if you have kids and they have kids

93
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,679
and so on and so on, you continue on,

94
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,799
in a way.
Maybe just genetically, not by name.

95
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,369
Well, people have tried.
The world record

96
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,199
for most children passed
out of one single woman

97
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,839
belongs to Mrs. Feodor Vassilyev.
She had

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,029
16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets

99
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,169
and 4 sets of quadruplets for a grand total

100
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,499
of 69 children.
As for being a biological

101
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,319
father, that takes less time.
The documented record

102
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,959
for most children fathered by one man is held

103
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,819
by Ismail Ibn Sharif, who is estimated to have had

104
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,829
more than 900 children with multiple women.

105
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,719
But children—or not—in a feedback system like

106
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,199
earth or life, cause-and-effect

107
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,479
are complicated and never ending.

108
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,459
Remember the double pendulums
from this video? A small difference

109
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,129
in the initial conditions of a system
can lead to enormously 

110
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,949
different outcomes later.
On Tuesday

111
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,569
I'm flying from London to Los Angeles.
The plane will be flown by pilots who

112
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,459
can steer it toward the correct runway

113
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,109
in the United States, but if the airplane needed to be

114
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,099
aimed from London and sent on a straight shot,

115
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,249
now, things would need to be very specific.

116
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,049
Misaiming just one degree to the left

117
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,459
at the beginning would send
the plane not to Los Angeles

118
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,969
but nearly 160 kilometres south
to Tijuana, Mexico.

119
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,319
Your name and your last words might
eventually be forgotten, but your status

120
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,769
as an initial condition for the universe's

121
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,639
future is already happening.

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,759
Bach died before he could complete

123
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,689
The Art of Fugue.
The peace ends abruptly

124
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,739
during Contrapunctus XIV.
So, composers continue

125
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,619
reconstructing it.
For that reason, it is

126
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,189
uniquely alive.
Speaking new

127
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,229
last words all the time,
as new people meet it

128
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,889
and finish it in their own way.
Likewise, no matter how

129
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,889
cool or lame and small

130
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:14,459
you feel, you will continue.
Your impact will be remembered, mathematics

131
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,189
guarantees it.
Even if like Bach you leave things

132
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,999
unfinished.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,299
And as always,

134
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,800
thanks for wa...
