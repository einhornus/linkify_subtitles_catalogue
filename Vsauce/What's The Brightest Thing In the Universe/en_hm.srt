1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,799
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,038
This symbol, commonly called a Yin Yang

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,229
symbol, is a taijitu meaning diagram

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,229
of the supreme ultimate. The principal

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,069
of Yin and yang, opposites existing in
harmony,

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,309
is associated with ancient Chinese
philosophy.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,309
But the very first use of the iconography,
the classic symbol,

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,569
actually comes from a shield pattern
used by the ancient

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,049
Romans seven hundred years before its first

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,709
known use in China.
A connection between the two

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,869
has yet to be found.
Regardless of who came up with it first,

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:48,509
the symbol was a bright idea.
But what's the brightest object in the entire universe?

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,209
Well, apparent magnitude.

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,239
Commonly used when stargazing refers to
how bright an object

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,979
appears to us, say, when looking up from Earth.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,409
It depends on Earth-centric factors,
like how close the object is

17
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,519
to our planet. Magnitudes are logarithmic

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,009
and arranged like golf, where a smaller number

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,299
means a greater brightness. But today

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,599
I'm looking for absolute magnitude,

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,279
a measure of how bright things all over
the universe near

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,399
and far would be if we looked at them
from the same distance.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,199
Absolute magnitude will guide
us to the most blinding

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,329
light in the universe, irrespective of it looking faint

25
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,549
to us here on Earth, just because it's far away.

26
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,929
The difference is significant. A 100-watt light bulb

27
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,659
placed closer than 8 centimetres - about
3 inches - from your eye

28
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,149
will appear brighter than the Sun in the sky.

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,609
But that's not fair. If you could see the Sun and the bulb

30
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,839
from the same distance, the Sun would be
a septillion times brighter.

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,529
That's bright. But the Sun

32
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,749
shines punily compared to the rest of the cosmos.

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,099
If you could line the Sun up with
everything else out there,

34
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,189
giving every star and cosmological
phenomenon

35
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,449
a fair chance, the Sun's absolute magnitude

36
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,299
would be 4.8. Not bad. But check out

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,169
R136a1. This nuclear fuelled beast isn't

38
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,939
the biggest star in terms of volume but it's 256

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,009
times more massive than our Sun.
It's the most massive star

40
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,409
ever found and it's also the brightest.

41
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,619
Remember that lower absolute
magnitudes are brighter.

42
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,099
R136a1 isn't 4.8,

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,999
like our Sun, it is -12.6,

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,818
which means it is 8.7 million times brighter

45
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,269
than our own Sun. But R136a1

46
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:01,179
isn't the brightest thing out there.
When a giant star dies, it explodes violently

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,389
in what is known as a supernova

48
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,879
or hypernova. As I mentioned in my video

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,009
'How Hot Can It Get?',
supernovas can eject terrifying flashes of

50
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,519
radiation known as gamma ray bursts.
Arguably,

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,009
the brightest electromagnetic events in
the universe.

52
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,119
A typical gamma-ray burst releases as much

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,449
energy in a few seconds as our Sun

54
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,599
will release altogether in its entire

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,659
10 billion year lifetime. If WR104,

56
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,069
a gamma-ray burst future candidate, directly struck

57
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,439
Earth with such a beam for only 10 seconds

58
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,909
astronomers predict it could deplete 25% of our

59
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,049
ozone layer and lead to mass extinction and starvation.

60
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,669
The largest thermonuclear bomb ever detonated

61
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,079
didn't do anything close to that and it
was exploded right

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,659
here, in our atmosphere. Whereas WR104

63
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,399
is eight thousand light years away.
You can't even see it with your naked eye

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,719
or a pair of binoculars.
But gamma ray bursts are merely brief

65
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,209
events lasting only a few minutes at most, sometimes

66
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,659
just a matter of milliseconds. If you want the brightest

67
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,768
sustained thing, you'll paradoxically have to look

68
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,179
at the darkest thing. Black holes.

69
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,829
To be fair, dark matter is ostensibly

70
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,918
darker. But because dark matter has been hypothesized

71
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,779
to not even interact with light, with electromagnetism

72
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,239
at all, calling dark matter "not bright"

73
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,629
is kind of like calling your peanut butter sandwich

74
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,589
"a not fast airplane".
It's not really even in the same category.

75
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,109
Black holes, however, do interact with light;

76
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,599
reflecting so little, well, they don't let any

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,899
escape, at least not in a form resembling the way

78
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,489
it came in. That's dark.

79
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,399
But the intense energies created by
black holes in the process of eating

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,019
things like stars

81
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,019
is anything but dark.
Gas and debris from the stars they eat swirl into

82
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,448
arcipluvian cosmic gallows known as accretion discs

83
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,138
before making their final death plunge
into the black hole.

84
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,138
In the disc, debris spins at unfathomable
speeds, pulled around by a black hole

85
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,269
billions of times more massive

86
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,679
than our Sun.
Friction in the accretion disk generates heat

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,948
on a level difficult to fully appreciate.

88
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,679
Just as hot things glow, the disk does too.

89
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,679
So brightly it has its own name.

90
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,959
A quasar.
Quasars shine thousands of times more brightly

91
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,399
than even the brightest stars.

92
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,878
I'm kidding, it's scarier

93
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,628
than that.
Quasars shine thousands of times more brightly

94
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:05,149
than galaxies containing billions of stars.

95
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,909
The first identified quasar, 3C 273,
has an absolute magnitude

96
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,429
of -26.7, making it

97
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,939
four trillion times brighter than our Sun,

98
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,669
about 100 times more luminous than the
total amount of light produced by the

99
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,869
entire Milky Way. If you put 3C 273

100
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,769
33 light years away from us it would
shine as brightly as our Sun - 

101
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,809
a mere 8 light minutes away.
Blocking the brightness of a quasar with the corona

102
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,699
graph reveals that quasars exist in the
centers of galaxies

103
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,719
that are larger than them in area, but are, nonetheless,

104
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,189
drowned out by their light.

105
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,519
Such galactic centres are called active galactic nuclei.

106
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,699
The bulk of their energy spewing forth
in the form of a powerful radiation jet,

107
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,829
the length of which puts even

108
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,739
our solar system to shame.
The visible part of the jet

109
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,399
in this photograph, for instance, is so
long it could stretch from the Sun

110
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,179
to Pluto and back, one-and-a-half million times.

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,459
Now, specifically, if a large portion of
this ajected energy heads toward Earth,

112
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,519
it's responsible for what we call a quasar.

113
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,649
But if Earth is right and the active
galactic nucleus' sights,

114
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,169
it's got a scarier name: a blazar.

115
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,239
And it's blazar 3C 454.3 that clocked
in the greatest brightness

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,639
ever observed.
At historically high levels of activity it registered in

117
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,179
absolute magnitude of -31.4.

118
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,559
To put the brightness of quasars

119
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,259
in yet another perspective, take a look
at the one hundred thousandth

120
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,389
picture snapped by the Hubble telescope.

121
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,339
This is a star a few hundred light years away.

122
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,399
And this thing looks just about as bright,

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,439
but it is a quasar.

124
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,389
9 billion light years away.

125
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,719
Why are quasars so far away?

126
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,979
Well, a quasar is not forever.

127
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,629
They are billions of light years away,

128
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,799
which means the light we receive from
them, the pictures we take of them,

129
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,209
are pictures of things happening
billions of years ago.

130
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,299
They represent a phenomenon more common

131
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,399
early in the universe's history, when
monster black holes hadn't eaten

132
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,918
all the stars around them to fuel their
accretion discs and

133
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,538
before those holes became too fat to be active.

134
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,779
Neil deGrasse Tyson points out that in order to remain

135
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,178
a quasar producer, a black hole must consume

136
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,279
about 10 stars a year. Many

137
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,969
consume more than a thousand stars a year, 600

138
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,679
Earths worth of matter every single minute. The more

139
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,649
stars a black hole consumes,
the larger its event horizon becomes

140
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,489
until, eventually, it no longer shreds stars apart

141
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,229
to fuel an accretion disc.
Instead, it just swallows them whole

142
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,839
in one dimmer, but still terrifying, gulp.

143
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,529
Quasars are some of the most
ancient things in our universe.

144
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,149
If you could teleport instantaneously to one right now

145
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:27,049
faster than light, it would most likely
no longer be burning. What we see

146
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,199
are just their ghosts. Light that left when they were

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,829
active that traveled longer than they could live.

148
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,899
But quasars can still be born. They can even be born

149
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,949
right here, in fact. In my video

150
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,649
'What Will We Miss?' I pointed out that
the Andromeda Galaxy

151
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,579
is headed our way.

152
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,739
In 3 to 5 billion years it will collide

153
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,129
with our own galaxy, the Milky Way. And the collision

154
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,559
could rearrange stars near the
galaxy's central black holes to be consumed,

155
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,018
reigniting a quasar right here, in our galactic backyard.

156
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,439
Funny enough, right now very few of us even see

157
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,299
Andromeda, even though all you
need is your unaided eye.

158
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,049
Light from our cities drowns out the night sky like a

159
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,869
quasar drowns out its host galaxy. Artist
Thierry Cohen mocked up what big cities

160
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,929
would look like if all their lights were

161
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,068
off and the sky above them could be seen

162
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:29,059
fully. New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai,

163
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,448
Tokyo, Los Angeles. It's beautiful

164
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,659
and rare. In the 1990s,

165
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,768
during a blackout in the city of Los Angeles,
a number of residence

166
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,979
actually called the police they were
afraid of mysterious glowing clouds

167
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,768
hovering above the city. They were seeing

168
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:53,638
our galaxy for the first time in their lives.

169
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,129
At night, artificial lights allow us to see

170
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,219
what's around us but we lose

171
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,679
what's above us. The brightest places

172
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,039
have the darkest, emptiest skies.

173
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,739
There's Yin and Yang again. A taijitu
has actually been lurking in this video

174
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,198
the entire time.

175
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:16,219
The brightest things in the universe, quasars,

176
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,509
are caused by the darkest things in the universe -

177
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:24,388
black holes. The process that unshackles the most light

178
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:29,059
is caused by the thing that best imprisons it.

179
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,889
And as always,

180
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,610
thanks for watching.
