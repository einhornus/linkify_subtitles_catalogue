1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,119
Happy birthday, hair's on fire.
And what is this dog worried about?

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,338
Oh great.
It's episode 43 of IMG!

3
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:11,558
Say "cheese."

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,628
Oh. Also on Tumblr this week I found
this price sticker.

5
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:19,309
Oh Pooh.
Here's an awesome plan I found on "dvice."

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,089
Not designs for a skyscraper,
but for an Earth scraper

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,389
in Mexico City; an inverted building that
goes down into the ground,

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,429
300 meters deep.
We've all seen contrails before,

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,529
clouds formed when the vapour in hot
airplane exhaust cools high up in the cold

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,718
air and the moisture

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,979
condenses, but there's also the opposite

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,498
of a contrail. When a plane flies low enough
through a cloud that

13
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:45,988
already exists and its hot exhaust turns
the visible water

14
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,259
back into water vapour, making a distrail, a racing part of the cloud.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,148
Wow, look at these legs on
Spain's Minister of Defense.

16
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,799
Are her feet on the wrong legs?
I mean, the big toe

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,599
on your right foot is on the left,
but hers is on the right...?

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,619
Well, it turns out it's actually an optical illusion.

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,809
Her legs are not actually crossed.

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,759
MoIllusions.com explains it with this.
.gif break.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,859
MoIllusions.com, by the way, is a great
site if you're not already checking it

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,789
out frequently.

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,299
Earlier this week it covered cinemagraphs,
a special artistic type

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,389
of animated .gif where video has been frozen
and only a small portion of it is

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,499
allowed to still be

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,909
a motion picture.
The effect is quite dramatic

27
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:36,179
and beautiful.
This is an advertisement for tires,

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,969
but maybe also for pandas?
And the only thing worse than being

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,469
alone is being watched.
Eeyore's nose is a cute little

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,659
face and in earlier episode I talked
about cats

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,879
wearing bread.
Well, according to BuzzFeed, they are now

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,779
also wearing tortillas, pitas and the birds

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,919
are catching on.
Of course, proper dental care is the real feline

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:14,158
challenge, so let's take a moment
for cats brushing their own teeth.

35
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,509
Owls can be pretty darn scary,

36
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,589
but charts, on the other hand, can be
pretty darn informative.

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,628
I love charts has analyzed
the Alanis Morissette's idea of

38
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,848
"Irony," as well as mathematical dance moves.

39
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:30,339
And this helpful chart showing powers of 10
from one septillionth

40
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,759
to one septillion. They also pointed
me to a recipe for tiramisu on Cooking

41
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,048
for engineers.com.

42
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:40,068
Rather than list directions,
this method flows from left to right

43
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:44,289
grouping actions to ingredients. People like
getting their picture taken as they fall down

44
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,259
Splash Mountain

45
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,419
and we've all seen the funny planned
poses, but this game cube one was new

46
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,969
to me

47
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,749
and the shades are really what makes it.
Oh, there it is.

48
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,208
My tongue cleaner with guaranteed export
quality. Just as nice of course

49
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,138
are these shoes: metal detectors, keyboards,

50
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,328
aliens and sandwiches;

51
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:08,458
which I like to put inside bags that
make them look mouldy,

52
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,809
covered in bugs or make my lunch a notebook,

53
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,018
a pair of jeans or comfy, comfy felt.

54
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,358
Chart Bin is another great info fix source.

55
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,029
Their interactive nuggets of wisdom show off
things like the only countries that

56
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,529
border

57
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,029
only one other country or which side of
the road

58
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,268
people drive on by country.
In the United States,

59
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,418
we drive on the right hand side. In the
UK and Ireland they drive on the left and

60
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,908
in Spain they drive on the right,

61
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,529
but in Kenya they drive on the left,
which is where I am

62
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,249
right now. Nairobi, Kenya. There's some
really great YouTubers out here doing some

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,988
cool stuff and I put some links to my favorites
in the description. The same site

64
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,469
also has a global map,
where you can mouse over a country to see

65
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,668
its national flag. I've been busy trying
to memorize the flags of

66
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:56,228
all these countries using the National
Flag's quiz app on my phone,

67
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,969
but this site is awesome 'cause it also gives you
the reason the flag looks the way it

68
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,469
does.

69
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,198
Interesting fact: the flag of Mozambique
is the only flag on

70
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,009
Earth that has a modern weapon on it.
That's right. It's got an AK-47

71
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,369
on the flag representing their
independence. Pretty neat, right?

72
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,529
And as always,

73
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,880
thanks for watching.
