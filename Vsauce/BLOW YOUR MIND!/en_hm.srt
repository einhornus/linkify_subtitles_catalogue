00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,532
Hey Vsauce, I've got a quick and fun video

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:05,232
for you today because I made a mistake.

3
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:07,322
Last week on Episode 10 of ING,

4
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:10,932
I showed a picture and I said,
"cat and dogs cooperating."

5
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:13,222
However, if you look at the picture
for more than a second,

6
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:16,182
you can tell that it's not a cat.
It's a monkey.

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,352
When a commenter pointed that out to me,
my mind was blown.

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,582
And so now I'm going to return the favor.

9
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:26,942
Prepare to get blown
in the mind.

10
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,452
First stop, Super Mario Galaxy.

11
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:31,412
Many of you may have already discovered this,

12
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:34,022
but if you read each letter and only each letter

13
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:37,022
that has a star underneath it
on the cover of the game,

14
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:42,892
it spells out "U R MR GAY."
Mario!

15
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:46,100
But don't the worry.
We might get the last laugh.

16
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,942
Here it is, an online Flash game
you can play right now

17
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:53,242
called Duck Hunt, more specifically,
"Kill the Dog From Duck Hunt."

18
00:00:53,243 --> 00:01:00,574
That's right. After all of these years,
you finally have the power.

19
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:03,242
Unfortunately, Nintendo may have one-upped us.

20
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:06,029
Remember this? After completing the castle,

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,619
it turns out Toad has been flipping us off
the entire time.

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,989
The Chicago Bulls logo upside down
is a robot reading a book,

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,249
and if you actually look closely, the Doom guy
has only ever had one gun.

24
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,959
More importantly, the poster for
Silence of the Lambs.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,339
We've all seen it, but have you ever noticed
all of the naked women?

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,639
I'm serious. Let's get a little closer in on the skull.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,469
Good. Do you see it? It's a portrait
by Salvadore Dalles.

28
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,349
And hey, what the H?
Let's do an audio illusion.

29
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,559
You're going to need headphones for this, but if you don't have them, I'll do a visual illusion simultaneously.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,319
Okay, stare into the middle of these swirling shapes

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,689
and listen through your headphones.

32
00:01:45,690 --> 00:02:09,588
You'll hear someone shaking a matchbook
three-dimensionally around you.

33
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:13,258
I spent more time yesterday than
I'd like to admit playing this game.

34
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,178
It's fun because you get to jump around,
but sometimes if you want to,

35
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:23,648
your jumps can have a little extra kick,
I guess because of your diet.

36
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:26,528
Okay, so puzzle farter probably didn't blow your mind,

37
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:34,158
but phew, it feels good to get off my chest
the fact that I love it.

38
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,418
One final fact, NERF is not just a silly word.

39
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,328
It's an acronym that stands

40
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,168
for non-expanding recreational foam,

41
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:52,338
also, I am made out of Vsauce.

42
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,018
I didn't really die, but if you have a secret about yourself,

43
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:57,888
leave it in the comments below.

44
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,099
And as always, thanks for watching.
