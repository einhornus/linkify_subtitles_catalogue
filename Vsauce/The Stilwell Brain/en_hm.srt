just 3% of the real answer.

119

 simulated neurons

 like counting, reasoning,

122

 SPAUN is cutting-edge,

123
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,952
 but neural networks
 are nothing new.

124
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,422
 The first was made
 by Dr. Frank Rosenblatt

125
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,525
 of Cornell University in 1957.

126
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,860
 His network, called
 the Perceptron,

127
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,929
 was designed for
 image recognition,

128
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,532
 and he hoped it would become
 capable of learning,

129
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,767
 just like a brain.

130
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,902
 But the project was only
 partially successful,

131
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,038
 and after some controversy,
 fell by the wayside.

132
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,808
 It was only when researchers
 in the 1980s

133
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,776
 came back upon
 Dr. Rosenblatt's work,

134
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,745
 and as computing power
 increased,

135
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:22,914
 that the field of artificial
 neural networks

136
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,682
 came back to the mainstream.

137
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,784
 Today, it is alive and well.

138
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:30,221
 SPAUN, and even neural networks
 used in self-driving cars,

139
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:35,660
 are expanding the possibilities
 of computer learning.

140
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,496
If I want to make
a brain out of people,
where do I start?

141
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:39,597
That's a good question.

142
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:41,532
I think the first thing
we want to do is figure out

143
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,900
what we want our brain to do.

144
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,769
I would recommend
something like vision.

145
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,607
Vision. Let's make
this brain see.

146
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,542
Michael:
 Before we can design
 the intricacies

147
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:52,743
 of the brain we're making,

148
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,513
 let's look at how
 visual processing works.

149
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:58,082
 Let's say we look at a cat.

150
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,618
 Light information
 from every point on the cat

151
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,220
 lands on the retina.

152
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,990
 This information gets sent
 to our visual cortex.

153
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,693
 The visual cortex 
 is structured in layers--

154
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,828
 V1 through V6.

155
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,930
 Each of these layers
 are made up of neurons

156
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:14,799
 activated by specific features,

157
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,835
 like lines, angles, and shapes.

158
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:19,237
 The features that are detected

159
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,639
 are sent to
 the infratemporal cortex

160
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,808
 which puts all the pieces
 of the image together,

161
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,977
 and we get our Eureka! moment

162
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,079
 where we recognize
 the object we're looking at,

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,016
 what it means what feelings
 we have towards it.

164
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:33,784
I love cats.

165
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:36,754
But what should we have
our brain recognize?

166
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,289
We don't want
really high resolution images

167
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,258
or images that depend
on too much detail,

168
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,193
- Ok.
- so things like letters
and digits.

169
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:43,294
Let's say we use digits. Ok?

170
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:46,631
- Ok.
- I want to be the one
who draws a digit,

171
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,034
and then you will be
on the output side.

172
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:53,905
You should be able
to determine what I've drawn;

173
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,874
not because I showed it
to someone and they
telephoned it back to you,

174
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:00,111
but because
they processed it
intelligently.

175
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,712
That's what we need
to figure out,

176
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,648
how we're gonna
show an input to our people.

177
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,182
So we should take
some small number of them

178
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,318
and put them at the front,
as the retina,

179
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,087
and really just show them each
a little bit of the image.

180
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:13,925
So if, for instance,
we're able to put like
25 people in that kind
of front row,

181
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,028
the "input" layer,
then whatever image we show

182
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,797
should be made up
of 25 pixels.

183
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,132
- Exactly. Right.
- Twenty-five pieces.

184
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,868
I'm gonna draw
25 people.

185
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,736
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

186
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,805
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

187
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,707
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

188
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,909
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

189
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,678
21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

190
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,812
See? I can count.

191
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,316
These are our retina cells,

192
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,117
and each one is
an individual person

193
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:42,753
that's literally standing,
like, in a field.

194
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,187
What do they then do next?

195
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,090
They merely need to indicate
whether or not

196
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,758
their cell is on or off.

197
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,927
- All right.
- So, they should start firing.

198
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,162
They should start spiking
like a neuron.

199
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,964
What could they do
to indicate

200
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,932
that they're firing or not?

201
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,834
They could jump up and down,

202
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,636
they could wave a flag...

203
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,204
OK, I like that.

204
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:03,240
When Chris and I use words
like "firing" and "spiking,"

205
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,676
we're talking about
how brain cells, neurons,

206
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:06,944
talk to one another

207
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:11,716
by sending an electric message
from one cell...

208
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,584
to another.

209
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,652
It's called
an "action potential,"

210
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:17,154
and it travels down the axon
of the cell.

211
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,724
When the ionic flow
into a brain cell

212
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,859
reaches a certain threshold,

213
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,362
the cell will fire an electronic
message down its axon.

214
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,164
So a neuron
can either be on or off.

215
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,767
It's either firing
or it's not firing.

216
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:32,269
What we need to find
is a way for a person

217
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,038
to be either on or off--

218
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,341
raising a flag or their hand
should do the trick.

219
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:39,276
 To illustrate our visual input,

220
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,679
 I will be drawing a number
 from 0 to 9

221
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,249
 onto a grid divided
 into 25 squares, or pixels.

222
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,953
 Now each person, or neuron,
 will receive one pixel.

223
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:51,122
 If a neuron receives
 a pixel with writing on it,

224
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,923
 it will fire.

225
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:55,893
 The V1 layer identifies
 pixels in the retinal layer

226
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,362
 that form particular lines
 in the number,

227
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,732
 and the V2 layer identifies
 particular combinations

228
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:05,002
 of lines from V1
 that form angles.

229
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:08,739
- What does V3 do?
- V3 is more sensitive to color.

230
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,141
We're only working with
black and white in this case.

231
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,343
So you're saying we won't even
need to have a V3 in our brain?

232
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:13,911
We're skipping V3 altogether.

233
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,746
All right, sorry, V3.

234
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,215
- So we're gonna go
 straight to V4?
- Yeah.

235
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,850
Michael:
 V4 neurons will fire

236
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:22,019
 when their assigned
 combinations of angles

237
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,187
 have been detected.

238
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:25,156
 At this point
 the basic shape of a number

239
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,924
 is beginning to take form.

240
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:29,894
And so actually the next one
is called IT.

241
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,363
- Ooh!
- And that stands for
 infratemporal cortex.

242
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:33,931
Michael:
 Now don't worry.

243
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,900
 We haven't forgotten V5 and V6.

244
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,768
 They exist, they're responsible

245
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,271
 for higher-level image
 processing in our brain.

246
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,340
 But for our demonstration,
 we don't need them.

247
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,377
 We do, however, need
 the infratemporal cortex,

248
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:48,979
 which is the final layer needed
 for visual processing

249
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,748
 in the brain we're designing.

250
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,950
 Our IT will consist
 of ten neurons

251
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,786
 representing the numbers
 0 through 9.

252
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,988
 They will be looking at neurons
 in V4,

253
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:01,358
 and will only fire when their
 corresponding neurons fire.

254
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:04,361
 For example, if one
 or multiple V4 neurons

255
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:07,064
 representing the shapes
 of an 8 fire,

256
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:10,801
 the IT neuron
 representing the 8
 will also fire.

257
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,404
 Voila! We just recognized
 a number.

258
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:16,107
So what happens after
the infratemporal layer?

259
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,509
So after that,
I think that's where I'll be.

260
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,346
It's gonna be me making a
decision about what digit
I think was actually shown at
the end.

261
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,849
So I think we're gonna need
a couple hundred people,

262
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,518
so one question is,
where do you put
that many people?

263
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,087
I would love to use
my high school football field.

264
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:31,756
The question is,
is it gonna work?

265
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:36,127
- I am hopeful right now.
- We got our work cut out for
us.

266
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,928
Michael: Knowing how
 we want to structure

267
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,964
 our neural network,
 it was now time for us

268
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,066
 to head to my high school
 football field

269
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,335
 where our "brain"
 will take form.

270
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,036
 I spent a lot of time here

271
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,472
 impressing the world
 with my body's prowess--

272
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,241
 at the clarinet.

273
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,143
OK, so Chris,
I brought you here

274
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,978
because we need to talk about

275
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,314
the actual logistics of getting
all these people together.

276
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:59,049
So here's the plan
as I see it.

277
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,253
Everyone is going to be
wearing a shirt

278
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,889
that is a different color,
based on what layer they're in.

279
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,892
We're also gonna give
everyone one of those, um,

280
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,261
like, "I'm running
in a marathon" kind of...

281
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,263
- The big bibs?
- Bibs. Thank you. Yes.

282
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,431
I knew that too. You see,

283
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,199
I'm always checking, because
Chris is one of those nerds

284
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,169
who doesn't know
what us sportos
talk about.

285
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,938
Anyway, the bibs
will give every person
an individual number,

286
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:23,140
so if something goes wrong,

287
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,410
we can target
that one brain cell

288
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,078
and say, "Are you damaged?
What do you need?"

289
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,013
Take out the problem.

290
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,148
OK, we're here
on this 40 yard line.

291
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,051
I will be here.
This is gonna be
the input layer.

292
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:37,521
The retinal cells will be
all in front of me,
all 25 of them.

293
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:41,559
You are gonna be
way down in the end zone
on the output side.

294
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,128
And I'm gonna be
using the scoreboard.

295
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,597
-Ok.
- So when you
make your prediction,

296
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,166
based on what you think
the brain has figured out,

297
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,401
we'll put that on
the Visitor's side

298
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:55,239
and I'll reveal the Home number
as what I really wrote.

299
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,409
- Sounds good.
- So literally from here
 to that end zone

300
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,411
is the amount of space
we're going to need

301
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,279
for these hundreds of people

302
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,148
to also have
the right eye lines.

303
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,250
Just have to make sure that
communication lines are open,

304
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,220
meaning that it's easy to see
whoever you have to
pay attention to.

305
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,156
Michael:
 Our human brain will have
 a couple hundred people

306
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,058
 spread out in five layers

307
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,126
 across half a football field.

308
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:18,062
 Every single participant
 will be assigned

309
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,930
 to only react
 to certain neurons

310
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,866
 in the layer ahead of them.

311
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,935
 And it's complicated,
 so their positions on the field

312
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,404
 had to be carefully chosen
 so that every neuron

313
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,106
 has a clear line of sight

314
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:31,175
 to the neurons
 they are connected to.

315
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,143
In a way...

316
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,346
something will be born
on this field tomorrow.

317
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,914
( laughs )

318
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:38,616
- We shall find out.
- We'll find out!

319
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:46,624
All right.

320
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:51,896
( crowd chattering )

321
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,232
Michael:
 So what does it take
 to turn Stilwell into a brain?

322
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:59,036
 Well, seven tents, 550 chairs,

323
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:02,172
 twenty gallons of coffee,
 three hundred flags,

324
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:03,941
 t-shirt and hats,

325
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,277
 our drone operator Jeff,

326
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,511
 this cute little Gator,

327
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,046
 two hundred cinnamon rolls,

328
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:12,149
 and of course,
 our medic, Brian.

329
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,185
 Now all that's left
 is to pull this all off.

330
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:16,687
 A community is something
 that is bigger

331
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,289
 that the sum
 of all of its parts,

332
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,924
and so is a brain.

333
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,626
Now, today, I'm feeling
pretty excited about

334
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,561
the neural network
we're gonna build out of people,

335
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:27,364
because there's a zero percent
chance of rain,

336
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:31,135
but a 100% chance of brain.

337
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,370
OK, we better get started.

338
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:36,640
 The gates are open,
 and our neurons are filing in.

339
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:39,410
 First, they're all given
 color-coded t-shirts

340
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,613
 associated with the layer of
 the brain they will represent.

341
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:46,317
Just want go in the center?

342
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,352
Michael:
 And then they will
 take to the field

343
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:51,121
 to get in position.

344
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:54,291
Michael:
You all in the orange shirts
are the retina.

345
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,561
Your job is to say,
"Is there writing on my square?"

346
00:14:57,562 --> 00:15:00,631
or "Not." If your square
has any writing

347
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:03,734
or black marks on it,
raise your flag--
oh, and stand up.

348
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:06,470
 Now I'm sure all you
 mega-brainiacs out there

349
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:09,206
 remember every detail about
 how this brain

350
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,541
 is going to recognize numbers.

351
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,677
 But just in case you don't,
 here's a refresher.

352
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:16,480
 I will draw a number
 on a 25-pixel grid,

353
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:18,415
 break the squares up,
 and hand them out

354
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,184
 to every person
 in the retina layer.

355
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,554
 The retinal neurons
 will only fire if they
 have writing on their pixel.

356
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,356
The people in the yellow shirts,

357
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,992
you guys are V1.

358
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,994
 Each V1 neuron will be watching

359
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,129
 three retinal neurons
 in front of them

360
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,064
 and fire only if all three

361
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:36,066
 of their assigned retinal
 neurons fire,

362
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,268
 revealing lines
 that make up the number.

363
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:39,536
You guys are V2.

364
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,238
You're a bit more advanced.

365
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,773
You're looking for combinations
of features

366
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,475
that make, for instance, angles.

367
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,711
 The V2 neurons will be watching
 the V1 layer,

368
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,714
 and fire only if
 their assigned V1 neurons fire,

369
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,416
 revealing angles.

370
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,719
 V4 neurons will be
 looking at V2 neurons.

371
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,255
 Their firing reveals
 combinations of angles

372
00:15:58,256 --> 00:15:59,757
 that begin to form the number.

373
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,525
Finally, the purple shirts.

374
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:04,094
You all are
infratemporal cortex.

375
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,529
Extremely important role,

376
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,264
not more important
than the others, though.

377
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:09,533
 Part of the IT's function
 is to inhibit

378
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:12,603
 incorrect results it receives
 from the V4 layer.

379
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,172
 For example, if V4 neurons
 are indicating

380
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:17,374
 both a 6 and an 8,

381
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:21,111
 an 8 will outrank a 6
 because an 8 has more features.

382
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:25,115
 Chris will determine the number
 by interpreting the results
 from the IT layer.

383
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:28,385
 Got it? Good. Because
 it's happening now.

384
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:30,087
Michael (over loudspeaker):
All right!

385
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:33,457
It is time for me
to draw my first numeral.

386
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:42,166
Stand by.

387
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,567
There it is.

388
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,702
Now it's time to distribute
these pixels

389
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:47,638
to the photoreceptors
in the retina.

390
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,674
25, 24...

391
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,576
19...

392
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:53,744
13...

393
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:54,845
All right.

394
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,447
I have distributed

395
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,617
the input to the retina layer.

396
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:01,785
Is everyone ready?

397
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,188
( all cheering, applauding )

398
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:09,626
Three, two,
one, think!

399
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:11,862
 And they're off.
 The retina layer has fired,

400
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,396
 passing off signals to V1.

401
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:15,566
 V2 sees V1 firing,
 and also fires,

402
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,434
 cuing V4 and IT.

403
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,203
 There's a lot of flags
 on the play, folks.

404
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,137
Look at all this processing.

405
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:23,140
Good work, stay up,

406
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,540
I'm now walking back to Chris

407
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,845
where he will tell me
what you guys have processed.

408
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,880
All right, Chris,
it actually happened

409
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:31,348
way faster than I thought.

410
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,117
It took me forever
to get over here.

411
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,585
They were already done
"thinking."

412
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,153
It was really interesting
to watch.

413
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:37,721
We had a little bit of noise
in the system, for sure,

414
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:40,457
because we actually kind of
have two answers at the end.

415
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,826
So I'm going to be doing
something that brains do,

416
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,696
which is kind of
make a guess sometimes
based on the best evidence.

417
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,531
Michael:
All right, Chris.

418
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:51,435
What numeral
do you think I drew?

419
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:54,204
Chris:
I think you drew a 3.

420
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:57,708
Let's get that up
on the Visitor's scoreboard.

421
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,411
The numeral I truly drew...

422
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:02,513
was a 3!

423
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,183
( all cheering, applauding )

424
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,351
Chris:
Nice work.

425
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,319
There was some noise
in the system.

426
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,421
I think we can perfect this
a little bit,

427
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:13,223
because it wasn't
a confident 3,

428
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:14,591
but Chris did still
get it right.

429
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,660
And by "Chris,"
I mean all of you.

430
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:20,264
Michael:
 We gave each of our IT neurons
 a clear tube and plastic balls

431
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,232
 to make their job easier.

432
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,501
 Every time they see one of the
 neurons they're watching fire,

433
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:26,537
 they put a ball in their tube.

434
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,305
 If a neuron
 they're inhibited by

435
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:29,673
 has more balls than they do,

436
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:30,941
 they stop firing.

437
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,643
Michael:
Our model had a mistake.

438
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,412
You should have been
inhibited by 254,

439
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,781
meaning that if 254 is firing,

440
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:39,550
and puts a ball in the tube,

441
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,185
- you just sit down.
- OK.

442
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,820
But we didn't have 254
written down into your code.

443
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,255
I'm gonna do that right now.

444
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:46,690
 With that kink worked out,

445
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:53,664
 it was time to try again.

446
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,501
Take that one.
Thank you.
24...

447
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:00,537
Michael:
Three, two, one...

448
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:04,841
go!

449
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:07,477
Michael:
Ooh. There's not much happening

450
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:10,347
in V2 and V4.

451
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,350
Or IT, for that matter.

452
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:15,752
Looks like our brain died.

453
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:17,854
Michael:
 Something definitely
 went wrong.

454
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,590
 The processing stopped in V2.

455
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,459
So, I think our brain broke.

456
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,696
Not a single person in V4

457
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,398
or the infratemporal cortex

458
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:29,933
has been activated.

459
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,269
Chris: Seems like something
very strange happened

460
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,405
when the light
went through the lens
and got to the retina.

461
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:38,809
OK, but what you really mean to
say is that I handed the pixels
out to the wrong neurons.

462
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,844
- It's lookin' that way.
- Wow, who would have thought

463
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,746
that the worst-working
part of the machine

464
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:44,581
would be the actual people
who get to be people

465
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:46,583
- and not brain cells?
- I know, right?

466
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:49,953
OK, I think
I'm gonna do an 8 this time.

467
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:54,258
And I'm gonna put it
kind of up in this corner,

468
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,727
or along that side.

469
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,729
This is pretty weird,
it's not centered,

470
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,664
it's not filling up
the whole space.

471
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:03,734
Let's see if our brain
can recognize it.

472
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,335
 Each pixel of our image
 needs to go

473
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,638
 to a particular retinal neuron.

474
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,373
 To make sure I didn't
 mess it up again,

475
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,341
 we put numbers
 on the back of each one.

476
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:12,676
Is everyone ready?

477
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,645
- ( all cheer )
- OK.

478
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:19,349
Three, two, one, go!

479
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,485
Michael:
Oh, yeah.

480
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,421
Whoa!
That was fast.

481
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:26,323
Michael:
 Blink, and you'll miss it,
 so let's take a break,

482
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:29,426
 because this is the Mind Field
 Play of the Game.

483
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,795
 The 8 I drew contained
 13 pixels,

484
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:35,666
 and bam! the 13 retinal cells
 connected to those locations
 are firing.

485
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,701
 Now, that's what I call
 a sensation.

486
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,569
 V1 reads the formation
 perfectly.

487
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,038
 They don't even know it,
 but each one firing

488
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,572
 means a horizontal, vertical,

489
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,574
 or diagonal line
 has been caught.

490
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,076
 Now look at neuron 40's speed.

491
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:47,878
 It's sensitive only to
 a horizontal line

492
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,713
 low and to the right,
 which my 8 had.

493
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:53,317
 If retinal cells 23, 24, and 25
 all fire together,

494
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,053
 such a line has been sensed,
 and watch this--boom!

495
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,954
 Champion reflexes there,
 folks.

496
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:01,024
 If the V1 neurons
 a V2 player is watching, fire,

497
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:03,694
 they stand, and that means
 that the lines V1 caught

498
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,429
 made some corner angle.

499
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,998
 Standing V4 neurons are shapes
 made by those corners,

500
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,733
 but it all comes down to IT.

501
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:10,868
 A bunch of them fire.

502
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,769
 Lots of numbers contain
 the shapes I drew,

503
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,338
 but there can only be
 one MVP,

504
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,006
 and, dang,
 look at this teamwork!

505
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,507
 3 is inhibited by 8,

506
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:18,942
 0 is inhibited by 8.

507
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,510
 If 8 is getting
 this much activity,

508
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,379
 sit down
 and let that neuron score!

509
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,915
 This, my friends, is what
 we in the cognition sports biz

510
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,752
 call...a gr8 play.

511
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:30,787
Chris (over loudspeaker:
The purple people neurons

512
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,823
make me think that
you wrote an 8.

513
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,026
An 8? Let's put an 8
up on the scoreboard.

514
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:40,097
And as it turns out,
the numeral that I did write...

515
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,131
was an 8!

516
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:43,934
( all cheering, applauding )

517
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,570
- Nice job!
- That was good.

518
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,539
Michael:
 This was our first
 definitive success.

519
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,409
 Now it's time to really
 put the system to the test.

520
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,977
So I'm gonna draw a 1,

521
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,613
but then I'm gonna add
a line down here

522
00:21:56,614 --> 00:22:00,417
and I'm gonna do
a dot right there.

523
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:03,453
And we're gonna see if
that noise trips up our brain.

524
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:09,760
Three, two, one, go!

525
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,130
My guess is a 1.

526
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,032
The number that I drew was,
in fact, a 1.

527
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,667
( cheers, applause )

528
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,604
7...and I'm gonna put
a line through it.

529
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,707
Go!

530
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,175
Oh, yeah.

531
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:27,611
Man, these people are good.

532
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,647
Chris:
The brain thinks
it's just saw a 7.

533
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,582
I wrote a 7.

534
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,584
- ( cheers, applause )
- Nice work.

535
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,520
Nice work.

536
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,688
Michael:
 With two successful
 results in a row,

537
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,791
 for the last test
 I want to see what will happen

538
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,893
 if I really
 mess with our brain.

539
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,562
I'm not even going to draw
a number;

540
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:50,434
instead, I'm going to
fill in every single cell.

541
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,704
This means that
every single neuron
in the retina will fire,

542
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:57,073
will stand up and wave.
Let's see what happens.

543
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,509
My prediction, of course,
it's gonna look like an 8,

544
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:04,147
because an 8 is a numeral that
fills in a lot of the cells.

545
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:05,649
Are you all ready?

546
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,684
- ( all cheer )
- Good.

547
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:09,553
- Chris, are you ready?
- Ready!

548
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,854
Michael:
All right, I'm ready.

549
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:17,060
Three, two, one, go!

550
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:17,894
Chris:
What?!

551
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:21,131
( laughing )

552
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:26,002
- ( all cheering )
- Michael: Look at that.

553
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,638
- Michael: Holy cow!
- ( Chris laughs )

554
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:30,774
It looks to me like you
essentially opened up the eye

555
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,542
and shone a laser
right into it.

556
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:35,612
Right, yeah.
So what I did is,
I didn't even draw a numeral.

557
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:38,682
I just scribbled
all over the whole thing,
I filled in every single cell.

558
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,218
- So what does the brain
 think that I drew?
- The 8.

559
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,787
I had no idea the inhibition
would work that well.

560
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:46,690
We were able to single
all of that mess

561
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,091
down into just one guess,

562
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:50,160
and it really was
the smartest guess.

563
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:52,696
Right, it was the one with
the most features in it.

564
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,532
Michael:
Congratulations to
the entire infratemporal cortex,

565
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:58,835
V4, V2, V1, retina.

566
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:01,137
You guys have been amazing.
Great work.

567
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,773
( cheers, applause )

568
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,876
Today, I was a neuron.

569
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,143
My favorite part
about the brain

570
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:08,745
was that it actually worked.

571
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,113
My favorite part
was just the whole experience,

572
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:12,148
doing science,
meeting cool people.

573
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:14,851
It's just a really good
simulation of how
the brain works,

574
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:18,021
and it was just really cool
to take some information
from that.

575
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:19,222
Michael:
And as always,

576
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:21,658
thanks for...being a brain.

577
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:32,869
( all cheer )

578
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,837
Michael:
 Our small-town brain

579
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,972
 did work as predicted.

580
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,675
Made up of only 
a couple hundred neurons,

581
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:41,678
each one with no idea
what number I was drawing,

582
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,914
it was nonetheless able
to process the image

583
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,315
and determine
the correct answer.

584
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:48,919
We created a living,
breathing model

585
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,720
of a part of the human brain.

586
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:52,656
And our demonstration
was a new way

587
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,157
to illustrate and share

588
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:56,960
how the human brain
processes visual information.

589
00:24:56,961 --> 00:25:00,864
We were able to watch it
process...think...

590
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:03,300
in real time,
and that's amazing.

591
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,903
Its success shows what we can
achieve by working together,

592
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:10,273
and we only used
a small fraction

593
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:13,276
of the number of neurons found
in an actual human brain.

594
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:15,245
So imagine how powerful

595
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:17,881
the connections of
not a few hundred,

596
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:21,618
but a hundred billion 
human neurons could be.

597
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:23,687
Now, interestingly,

598
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,290
a hundred billion people
is about how many humans

599
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:31,595
have ever existed
in the history of Earth.

600
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,864
There are only a few billion
alive right now,

601
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:39,703
so I guess that means
get procreating...please.

602
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,839
I want to make a bigger
superhuman mind.

603
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,375
No. I'd like to thank
every neuron

604
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:47,611
from my hometown of Stilwell,

605
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,046
and the entire community
that supported us.

606
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:52,616
Because without them
all working together,

607
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,018
none of this
would have been possible.

608
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,786
And as always...

609
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:59,122
thanks for watching.
