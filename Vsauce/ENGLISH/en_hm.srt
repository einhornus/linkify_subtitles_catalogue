1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,552
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and today, we're
going to talk about this.

2
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:09,544
What's happening right now—
the English language.

3
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:14,106
A language spoken by more than a billion
people with many, many different accents.

4
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:17,560
And according to last year's Harvard Google study,

5
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:20,191
a language with more than a million words

6
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:25,199
growing at a rate of 8500 new words
every single year.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,273
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.
Where did English begin?

8
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:33,702
Well, for that answer, we're going to have to go
all the way back to the year 400,

9
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:37,166
and even earlier to this little Germanic peninsula

10
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:42,215
jutting off at an angle inhabited by people who
appropriately were called Angles.

11
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:46,512
Now, these Angles began immigrating to
an island named Britain.

12
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,625
In fact, there were so many Angles there,

13
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:51,550
you may as well have called it Angle Land.

14
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,933
Angle Land, England.

15
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:57,107
Before they had Latin characters,

16
00:00:57,108 --> 00:01:01,521
they wrote their language not in letters,
but in what are known as roons.

17
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:05,402
And everything was fine and dandy until 1066

18
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:09,110
when the Normans invaded and won.

19
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,954
One of the neatest changes that still affects us today

20
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,870
is the fact that this new Norman ruling class

21
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:19,416
would refer to the meat they were served using their own words like beef or pork.

22
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:22,961
But the poor old Anglo Saxons who
had to tend to the animals

23
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:28,628
still used their early old English words, for instance,
cow and pig.

24
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:32,844
And to this day, that is why English is one of the very few languages on Earth

25
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:37,355
that has a different name for the meat
of an animal than the name of the animal it came from.

26
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:39,854
English did this a lot,

27
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:42,394
borrow words from other languages and other people

28
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:45,360
and just plop it right down into the English vocabulary.

29
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:47,900
So see, English is really fun,

30
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:51,486
or should I say fun is really English?

31
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:54,289
That's right, unlike all of these borrowed words,

32
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,038
the word fun can be traced all the way back to the Angles

33
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,374
and the protogermanic word phono,

34
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,493
which referred to a piece of cloth or  rag.

35
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:08,837
It eventually came to mean a piece of fabric,
say a hoisted flag that flew in the breeze.

36
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:12,006
And then it just came to mean anything
that was high flying

37
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,343
or buoyant, you know, like fun stuff.

38
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:17,807
Singling out which words in English were borrowed

39
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:19,981
and which ones were originally Germanic

40
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:22,896
could be a pretty fun exercise, for instance, supervise

41
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:28,027
is derived from Latin, but oversee,
that's straight up Germanic.

42
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:32,740
Well, what would English sound like
if we just got rid of all these words

43
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:34,985
that didn't originally come from the Angles?

44
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:39,201
Well, what you would have is what is known
as Anglish.

45
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:42,625
Anglish is really fun to read, because it's
not really a real language,

46
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:44,626
it's just an exercise that we can do nowadays.

47
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:49,461
My favorite is this passage explaining atomic theory.

48
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,757
Of course, you can't call it atomic theory

49
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:54,216
because, for instance, the word atom is Greek

50
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:58,137
meaning something that cannot be divided
any further, so instead of using the word atom,

51
00:02:58,138 --> 00:03:01,439
writers will use words like uncleft.

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,227
And instead of using a word like theory,

53
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:05,309
they'll use a word like beholding.

54
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,275
There's a link in the description to read all
of uncleft beholding.

55
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,490
But now let's talk about accents.

56
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,491
We don't all speak English the same way,

57
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:18,454
and as a confession, I'm going to say
I'm terrible at impressions—accents, dialects—

58
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:20,537
I pretty much only ever talk like this.

59
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:23,666
Luckily, I read the science, and young children

60
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,002
are the best at picking up new accents.

61
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:29,456
So I brought along my friend Todd.

62
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:32,087
Nicely done!
-Thank you!
-Classic Vsauce move.

63
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:37,301
Now, Todd is from ???, and he is fantastic at accents.

64
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,718
Gratzi, Michael, gratzi.

65
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,101
I'm impressed every day. But here's a
challenge for you, are you ready?

66
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:47,734
Challenge.
-I want you to do an impression of exactly how you think

67
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:51,198
George Washington spoke.

68
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,697
Let me just picture him, I've seen him on a quarter before.

69
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:56,277
I think he probably sounded like this.

70
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,121
Wassup, players? So, y'all gonna vote for me?

71
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,498
I ain't gonna take two terms, just give me one - one shot,

72
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,251
uh, one and done, baby, you know what I'm saying?

73
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:07,787
Naw, seriously, father, I did not
chop down that cherry tree.

74
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:11,261
I like that, but you know what?
There's no way to be wrong.

75
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:15,669
Well, I mean, there are ways to be wrong,
but we don't know the real answer,

76
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,682
because back at the time that America
first became a country,

77
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:22,349
the classic British accent
didn't even exist yet.

78
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,589
I quite like the Queen's English, yes.

79
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,560
Yeah, that would be completely foreign to them.

80
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:30,188
But here's what's really mind blowing about what the British gave to America—

81
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:33,114
southern drawl.

82
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,196
That's right, these people known as the cavaliers

83
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:39,158
came over to America before it was
an actual independent country,

84
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,789
and they brought things like the word y'all,

85
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,831
snickerdoodle, varmit,

86
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:47,082
and they brought the word axed instead of ask,

87
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,296
and the word ain't.

88
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:52,761
As well as emphasizing the first syllable of words

89
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:56,175
like guitar, July, and police.

90
00:04:56,176 --> 00:05:00,178
Man, I've taken a lot of heat from English people from being from Texas and all that,

91
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,139
and they started it, didn't they?

92
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,720
But listen to this, the bo language

93
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,646
was a language spoken on an island off the coast of India,

94
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:11,648
and then last year, this woman died.

95
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:22,955
She was the final speaker of the language.

96
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:26,784
All I can think about is that lady trying to connect to people like oh, let us share in the cultural joke,

97
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,334
you know, the famous cultural joke of the Bo people.

98
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:33,214
Yes, yes, it was probably quite lonely, Todd.

99
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:36,425
Modern English as we know it didn't really begin that long ago.

100
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:38,964
Think of it this way, there's a time capsule buried

101
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,555
here in New York that is not going to be opened

102
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:45,263
until the year 6939.

103
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:48,148
By then, English itself may be completely different

104
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:52,150
or possibly extinct, and so they actually included a drawing

105
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:56,112
of the human mouth where they diagrammed out where you need to put your tongue

106
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:58,530
to say the letters like we say them today.

107
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:01,700
And we only have to wait almost 5,000 years?

108
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:04,493
What a bargain, how convenient for everyone!

109
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,494
Yeah, what are we gonna do in the meantime?

110
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:09,207
Well, you could head over to my
channel for some comedy stuff.

111
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,087
We did an episode of Vsauce called Vsauce Unplugged.

112
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:15,962
There's a lot of meat information over there about the brain and language,

113
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:19,843
some joking around, and I got to talk to Dale.

114
00:06:19,844 --> 00:06:22,464
Dale the mouse.

115
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:27,269
He does not play around.
-No. Be sure to check out the cheese shorts over on Todd's channel.

116
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,225
It's much more funny than Vsauce, but when you're there,

117
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:34,349
and every time I'm there I'm just impressed by the characters and the accents and the language.

118
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,696
We've got all sorts of stuff, we've got behind the scenes awesome stuff,

119
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,815
we got stand up, we've got me going to China,

120
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:45,036
we've got all sorts of comedy stuff. Come over for a visit, I'll give you a bowl of soup, come on.

121
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,451
Yeah, come on, I'll see you there,
and as always, thanks for watching.
