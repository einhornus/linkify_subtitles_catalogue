00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:05,498
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here on a couch with
Vi Hart and Henry from MinutePhysics.

2
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:11,459
Now, of all the people on this couch I probably
have the least famous hands, but the most

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,338
hairy.
So here we go.

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:20,499
My hand, a mouse trap and how about a phantom
at 3,000 frames a second.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:30,259
Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,019
The  slow-motion looks fantastic.

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,799
But right now I'm in Dallas visiting my sister
and for some things you can do online now

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,099
guys, check these out.
First of all, instead of watching a guy solve

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,139
a Rubik's Cube with his nipples,
have some fun frolicking in Meow-Mania.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:58,659
And if it's not cute enough for you, Ponycorns
is a game written and voiced by a small child.

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:05,448
But if you're not a fan of Ponycorns, well,
try it anyway, because YOLO.

12
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:08,459
The game.
BrandonDSmithTV showed me this simple little

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,949
platform that truly investigates the
"You Only Live Once" philosophy.

14
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,579
And for an even darker challenge,
check out "Ebony."

15
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,239
I love these things.
Clever puzzle sites that require you to think differently.

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,519
It gets quite challenging, so good luck.
And relax by enjoying some 3D panoramas from

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,908
the air.
Choose a spot in the sky and then use your

18
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:37,608
keyboard and mouse to look around.
Or feel around with your hand.

19
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:40,849
Your sticky hand.
Bryt9 brought me here.

20
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,849
And don't forget the other Coke sitelets,
like this one, where you can tease a bottle

21
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,658
oh, so close to some dominoes.
Now, you can also do experiments in these

22
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,799
virtual worlds with Little alchemy.
I've got an app like this on my phone, but

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,529
your browser can play too.
Drag and combine elements to see how many

24
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,539
new things you can create, combine in creative
ways to generate them all.

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:15,699
And if you're sick of fast Internet, 
reminisce with dialupsound.com.

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,229
Says-It makes things say whatever you want.
I particularly enjoy the concert ticket, the

27
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:29,489
warning sign and the gas station sign.
Let's take a break from making things and

28
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,139
watch Neave[.com].
He's got amazing things I've covered before,

29
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,299
but SmartWentCody brought his TV to my attention.
It's weird, curiosity-peeking clips that change

30
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,039
for your pleasure or whenever you click.
But for a bigger cute factor, be like MinecraftTurtle

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,199
and watch this Ustream of kittens.
They're kind of tired now, but in the morning

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,549
they're super fun.
Oh and this inverse grapher will turn whatever

33
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,699
you type into some equations that graph it.
But let's talk lines.

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,419
Here's a 3D line flying game where you control
the direction and the shape you leave behind.

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:13,279
Make knots and coils and use your previous
path as an obstacle course for your future.

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,579
Okay, this is something that I love.
Have you ever tapped the melody to a song

37
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,199
with your finger on a table, for instance,
and asked a friend to guess the song, only to

38
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,889
find that by listening to the tapping alone
your friend cannot even come close to guessing,

39
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,689
while in your own mind it seems obvious.
Well, psychological studies have been done

40
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,699
on this phenomenon and it turns out that the
big difference is knowledge.

41
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,209
The fact that you know what melody to expect
makes it difficult for you to understand why

42
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:46,549
the task is so difficult to others.
Now that said, Bored.com has built this.

43
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,079
Songtapper.
A machine that is learning how to understand

44
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,499
tapping with a space bar.
Check this out.

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:06,219
I'll tap a song.

46
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,139
Not bad.

47
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,599
Let's talk about something that's off-lying.
The Moon.

48
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,278
How big is the Moon in the sky?
What sized coin would cover the Moon if held

49
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,818
at arm's length?
Funny enough, the Moon is a lot smaller in

50
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:26,318
the sky than you'd think.
Different visual illusions that we still don't

51
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,089
quite understand influence how big we perceive
the Moon to be in the sky, but in reality,

52
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,978
the size of the Moon in the sky is only about
the size of a hole punch in a piece of paper

53
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:40,419
held at arm's length.
That's tiny.

54
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,188
Alban brought up Sinuous, which lets you relax
as you mouse around as a line that must avoid

55
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:52,138
dots while acquiring shields and other goodies.
And share your mouse-moving skills like Josh

56
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,939
with this Swedish armed forces game.
You're added to a team of real people and

57
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,899
given a colour.
Here I'm the red cursor and the other ones

58
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,149
are other people playing at the same time.
Then complete tasks in order to help your

59
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,429
team mates.
[Voice:] Which colour was the shape?

60
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,968
[Voice:] Correct, yellow.
[Voice:] Status increased.

61
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:18,768
Make a mistake and they suffer.
Finally, a very special long DONG for you

62
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,698
guys.
An entire list of every single DONG I've ever

63
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:25,539
covered in an episode of DONG.
We've put them all in one place, check all

64
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,239
of those out.
Watch all the previous episodes if you haven't

65
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,658
already.
And I will be at Comic-Con later this week.

66
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:34,319
I hope to see some of you there.
I'm on the Dark Matters panel on Friday.

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,248
And as always,

68
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:36,269
thanks for watching.
