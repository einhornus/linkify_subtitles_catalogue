1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,759
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,939
Earth only contains 1066 people.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,199
Earth, Texas.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,579
The only place on Earth officially named Earth.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,239
There are at least two places named
Moon

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,499
but the Earth only has one astronomical
Moon.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,469
Or does it? From September 2006 to June
2007, Earth had an additional Moon

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,339
named 2006 RH120. It's a near Earth

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,109
asteroid that usually orbits around
the Sun but for 13 months

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,469
it fell into an orbit around our planet
and became

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,959
another Moon of Earth. We can call it that
because technically

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,979
a Moon is just a natural satellite. Something in

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,518
orbit around a planet that humans
didn't put there.

14
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:56,039
There's no official minimum size
requirement for Moon status.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,238
The Moon, it's a Moon.

16
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,399
Sputnik, space junk, the International
Space Station -

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,338
not Moons, they are artificial satellites.

18
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,709
Astronomers believe that, most of the
time,

19
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,508
Earth has additional Moons. These
newcomers don't always stick around that

20
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,298
long and they tend to only be about

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,349
a meter in diameter, so we don't always

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,559
detect them and they could, less sensationally,

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,699
be called temporary asteroid moons. But,

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,368
the vagueness of the word Moon means that, yes, technically

25
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:32,239
Earth usually has more than one

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,319
and Earth is booking it. I mean we're
moving through space

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,938
incredibly quickly. A light year is an
almost

28
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,949
unfathomable distance to put in the human
terms

29
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,279
but our solar system orbits around the
center of the Milky Way

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,699
at about 782,000 kilometres an hour.

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,239
Which means, that from the perspective of the center of

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,658
our galaxy, about every 1300 years

33
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,858
Earth travels an entire light year.

34
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:04,089
In other words, the Great Pyramid of Giza,

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,458
wasn't just built 4500
years ago, it was also built

36
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,739
almost three-and-a-half light years away.

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,989
Big deal - what's it all worth?

38
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,559
Could we assign a price to the entire
planet? To Earth itself?

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,849
Well, Greg Loughman, an astrophysicist at
the University of California, Santa Cruz

40
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,269
devised a beautiful equation for assessing the

41
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,839
value of exoplanets we discover.

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,979
It considers their habitability, their ease of being studied

43
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,158
and, of course, how much money we've already spent

44
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,679
looking for them. Funny enough, you can solve

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,298
for Earth and find out that compared to
what we've already spent looking for

46
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,469
exoplanets - and what we know about them - Earth is worth

47
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,889
about five quadrillion dollars.

48
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,279
The History Channel famously stuck to
Earth and

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,059
rang up all of Earth's resources like
water, lumber and granite using the

50
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,488
current market prices they arrived at a total

51
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,979
of seven quadrillion dollars. If you
removed and

52
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,669
isolated all of the elements your body
contains, and then solved them each

53
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,039
at market price, you could fetch about two thousand dollars.

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,378
Reddit user Shady Potato applied this map

55
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,548
to Earth. If we could mine the entire
planet, and separate out all of it's

56
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,729
pure elements, and prices didn't change
because of that, we could sell it all

57
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,379
for 15.8 sextillion dollars.

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,229
Of course calculations like
these don't include every single possible

59
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,318
thing earth, or any other planet has to offer,

60
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,568
and they also don't consider supply and demand.

61
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,729
If someone here on Earth, or some extraterrestrial

62
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,048
group of planet shoppers, had quadrillions,

63
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:57,458
sextillions of dollars, or the
equivalent amount of power,

64
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,149
well, they would have the option to shop
in a much

65
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,559
larger store. For crying out loud, there
are more than 10,000 asteroids right here

66
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,519
near Earth. And just one of them - 433 Eros - 

67
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,149
is estimated to contain a half
quintillion dollars worth of platinum

68
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,659
alone, and by weight, even more iron.

69
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,209
So to be more realistic, instead of
calculating Earth's value

70
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,599
on Earth, let's calculate its value on the

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,219
galactic marketplace, or the universal

72
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,689
marketplace. If you, or some
hypothetical group of

73
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,249
aliens, shopping for a planet could pick any planet

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,379
in the entire Milky Way galaxy, what about
Earth would make it

75
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,959
worth anything? The Milky Way galaxy

76
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,369
is estimated to contain a supply of around 100

77
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,918
to 400 billion planets. As far as

78
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,068
Earth analogues go, Kepler space mission
data suggests there were probably

79
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:59,119
40 billion Earth size planets orbiting
within habitable zones

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,859
of stars in our galaxy. And within the
observable universe?

81
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,119
Quadrillions.

82
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,809
So, from a raw materials and habitability
stand point, Earth

83
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,819
probably isn't that rare. But Earth

84
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,659
does have some unique selling points.

85
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,859
For one, it's probably the only planet like itself
within at least 12 light years.

86
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,239
So its location might be prime real estate

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,668
for an intergalactic rest stop or imminent

88
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:30,939
domain. And secondly, statistically
speaking,

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,989
life as we know it might not be unique to Earth,

90
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,508
but there probably isn't life
elsewhere that formed exactly like it did here

91
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,059
with jaguars, palm trees and hairless
bipeds

92
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,008
who made the same buildings and
jokes and art and music

93
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:50,579
that we have. These might be the truest
unique selling points for Earth.

94
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,819
Aliens wouldn't have to understand, or
appreciate any of it,

95
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,008
if it merely amused them it might
be worth purchasing as a sort of

96
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,679
museum, or zoo at the least.

97
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,369
Of course, interstellar planet shoppers
wouldn't have

98
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,309
Earth currency to buy it with, and space cash

99
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,309
isn't worth anything here. But

100
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,418
the technology it would take for them to get to us

101
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,799
would likely be at least thousands of
years ahead of what we currently have. So,

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,029
an equitable trade might be, say, limited use of Earth

103
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,119
in exchange for their knowledge. Or full

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,089
use - or abuse - of Earth in exchange for
their knowledge

105
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,339
and fair relocation of all

106
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,269
earthlings to some equally habitable exoplanet.

107
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,939
Boy, this type of speculation is totally

108
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,299
sci-fi. But you know what's not? The next part of

109
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,388
establishing Earth's value:

110
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,199
demand.

111
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,378
Despite what Earth has to offer,

112
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,128
despite what makes it unique, and despite
National Geographic's list of

113
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,689
ten reasons other life forms might want Earth

114
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,818
so far we have received

115
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,559
0 offers.

116
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,499
The Fermi Paradox formally

117
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,459
phrases this puzzle. With so many
friendly to life as we know it

118
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,739
planets out there, many of which have
been around longer than

119
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,989
even Earth, why haven't we been visited by,

120
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,299
or heard from, intelligent life yet?

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,918
Maybe Earth, and its intelligent life, really are

122
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,999
rare and special. Or maybe Earth

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,068
is so typical, so unremarkable, no other
intelligent advanced lifeforms

124
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,499
could be bothered to stop by. But this
raises another question.

125
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,978
Even if something came by, what makes us
think it would

126
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,288
make an offer? Why would it consider our wishes at all?

127
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,288
In Star Trek 4, the aliens wanted to
talk to whales

128
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,989
and humans were just an awkward third wheel.

129
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,679
When Thomas Jefferson made the Louisiana
Purchase, he didn't ask,

130
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,559
say, squirrels in Nebraska for
permission. He just

131
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,619
did it. And all those squirrels were
suddenly in America,

132
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,848
without knowing it. For all we know, that

133
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,399
may have already happened to us. Earth
could be owned by some larger

134
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,408
interstellar landlord.

135
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,508
Furthermore, this entire question rests on an
even more fundamental

136
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,138
assumption, the assumption that other
intelligent life forms

137
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,209
share our concept of ownership;

138
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,228
and the belief that physical things can
be bought

139
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:30,279
and sold. Amongst earthlings, human

140
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,449
bartering is pretty unique. Only we have developed

141
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,989
complicated, socially agreed-upon norms,
for the barter of

142
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,459
goods, the use of currency for goods, or
the concept that you can

143
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,899
own a piece of Earth's surface.

144
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,389
Sure, animals can be territorial, but they
haven't developed that into a more rigorous

145
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,648
expansive sense of fair exchange.

146
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,059
And when it comes to an individual owning more
things than they could possibly hold

147
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,669
or defend on their own, well, we humans
have systems for that.

148
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,139
We can teach some animals to use tokens
as currency to exchange for

149
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,359
treats, but left on their own they don't
incorporate

150
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,268
economic ideas into their regular social lives. At the most, we observe animals bartering

151
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,539
amongst each other for services - 

152
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,999
but not goods. Why? Well, they may lack
the cognitive ability required to keep track of

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,749
long-term transactional histories.
But they also lack

154
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,479
two other extremely important things:
communication and enforcement.

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,669
Services, like

156
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,399
grooming, are difficult to steal, so
animals can easily trade them.

157
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,199
But without a language to facilitate

158
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,669
snitching, non-humans can't easily

159
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,379
report thefts or devise systems for reporting

160
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,839
and punishing violations. Animals create some pretty beautiful things.

161
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,359
Bowerbird nests, Pufferfish circles,

162
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,869
termite mounds, or the dramatic costumes
decorator crabs fashion

163
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,319
out of sea floor debris.

164
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,069
But ownership, and the right to buy or
sell what you make,

165
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,159
is only as useful as the power you have to enforce it.

166
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,559
And if you don't have enough power,
someone or something else will make decisions

167
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,479
for you. For instance, we have decided that animals

168
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,359
don't own the selfies they take.

169
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,549
Three years ago in Indonesia a monkey stole photojournalist

170
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,869
David Slaters' camera. He later retreived the camera and found that the monkey

171
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,109
had snapped these fantastic images.

172
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,979
Slater maintained that he should receive
royalties from people who reproduce the images, like

173
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,039
Wikimedia, but US federal regulators
recently ruled that since a

174
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,278
non-human animal created these photos, they're

175
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,619
officially in the public domain. They
belong to all of us.

176
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,819
The same goes for selfies taken by elephants,

177
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,399
or lambs,

178
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,679
or Asian short-clawed otters, named Musa.

179
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,599
And it's not just selfies at play here,
the same goes for paintings made by

180
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,899
chimpanzees

181
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,019
or dog artists.

182
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,399
So, maybe Earth is worth quadrillions

183
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,919
or sextillions of dollars. Maybe it's worth renting

184
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,849
in exchange for technological know-how. 
But the mere fact that we can conceive of ourselves

185
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,639
selling our own planet is pretty
incredible.

186
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:32,059
I mean, we don't have a deed to planet
Earth, we really only own it via finders, keepers.

187
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,589
But we didn't stumble upon Earth like a hermit crab in its shell,

188
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,949
we really just emerged from it. We didn't
build Earth,

189
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,409
if anything, its selective pressures
built us.

190
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,279
Does that mean Earth is sort of like a womb?

191
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,699
Does that mean us selling Earth would be
the same as a child selling his or her

192
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,539
parents?

193
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,439
Well, not really. Because we aren't here

194
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,619
for the purpose of leaving, analogous to

195
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,539
being born. Honestly, the most fitting metaphor
might be

196
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,899
not that we are Earth's owners, or
children,

197
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,219
or one in the same with it, but rather
that we are

198
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,019
Earth's first willful

199
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,019
effluvia.

200
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,849
In the context of the human body,

201
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,039
effluvia are little emissions of things

202
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,289
built-up within. They often make us

203
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:30,019
giggle and can be gross. And isn't that
what we are?

204
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,859
A sometimes messy, stinky presence that
has built up

205
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,309
within and will one day inevitably, and
to the extent already have,

206
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,639
discharged out into space?

207
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,989
I guess what I'm saying is that putting
a price tag

208
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,179
on Earth is all speculation. We don't
know if we will never be

209
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,469
Earth's sales person. But what we do know

210
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,779
is that we are Earth's first

211
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,339
fart.

212
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,419
And as always,

213
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,960
thanks for watching.
