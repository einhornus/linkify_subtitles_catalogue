1
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:13,545
Someday, I will die.

2
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,246
But should I?

3
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,648
If I was offered
a longer life,

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,817
I would take that
in a second.

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,719
But how long is too long?

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,124
Is death something
I should deny forever,

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:30,295
or is death and the role
it plays in the universe

8
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:56,321
something I am better off
accepting?

9
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,289
I want to start by looking
at a particular way

10
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,495
death affects how we live
and treat one another.

11
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,430
Terror Management Theory

12
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,732
proposes that people
like you and me

13
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,536
manage the terror
of death's inevitability

14
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:13,805
by embracing cultural values.

15
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:17,809
That the more aware a person is
of their own mortality,

16
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,477
the more vehemently
they will enforce

17
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:22,647
their particular views
of the world onto others.

18
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:25,450
Created by social psychologists
 Sheldon Solomon,

19
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,752
 Jeff Greenberg
 and Tom Pyszczynski,

20
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:30,755
 Terror Management Theory,
 or TMT,

21
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:34,392
 suggests that, often,
 we are afraid of change

22
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,728
 because we're afraid
 of death.

23
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,363
 Each one of us
 has a worldview,

24
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,898
 a set of beliefs,
 customs and norms

25
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,667
 we identify with
 that can live on

26
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:44,802
after our physical bodies die.

27
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:48,239
 TMT suggest that rises
 in nationalism and prejudice

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,577
 are correlated with rises
 in the salience of mortality.

29
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,646
 That is, how present
 the inevitability of death is

30
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,247
 in people's minds.

31
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:58,783
Now this role that death plays
 fascinates me,

32
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,719
 and two of TMT's originators,
 Jeff and Sheldon,

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,454
 have agreed to work with me
 on a pilot study

34
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,590
 of Terror Management Theory

35
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:10,294
 and real-life reminders
 of death.

36
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,964
What's your hypothesis today?

37
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:16,834
Well, I think we're going
to hope for the participants

38
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,204
who are reminded
of their mortality

39
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,874
to be more punitive
in their assessments.

40
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,543
See what happens.

41
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:26,844
 For our study,

42
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:29,380
 we created a fake research
 center,

43
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:30,782
 staffed by actors,

44
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,650
 and invited participants
 to be a part

45
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,452
 of what they were told
 was a focus group

46
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:36,588
 about the criminal justice
 system.

47
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,557
 During the actual study,
 each group will hear a list

48
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:41,693
 of several different crimes
 that have been committed,

49
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,762
 and will then be asked
 to propose a punishment

50
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,664
 for each offender
 with a severity level

51
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:50,468
 ranging from 1 to 7,
 with 1 being the most lenient

52
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:52,604
 and 7 being
 the most severe.

53
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,473
 The control group will simply
 enter the survey room

54
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:57,875
 and be asked
 to answer the questions.

55
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:59,444
 The experimental group,
 however,

56
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,845
 will first be exposed

57
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:03,348
 to reminders of their own
 mortality

58
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,918
 with strategically placed
 posters in the lobby.

59
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,519
 Also, the questionnaires
 they fill out

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,522
 will include questions
 about their own death.

61
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:14,459
 Decades of TMT research
have shown that when presented

62
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,427
 with violations
 of common worldviews,

63
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:19,397
 those who are more aware
 of their own deaths

64
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:20,665
 will recommend bigger
 punishments

65
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,834
 for the crimes presented.

66
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,303
 But will our real life
 reminders of death,

67
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:26,804
 not just the survey questions
 usually used,

68
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:28,706
 make a difference?

69
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:32,443
 Well, first, let's look
 at the control participants.

70
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,879
[woman] Well, thank you
so much for being here.

71
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,381
Now, I cannot
emphasize this enough.

72
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,516
There are no
right or wrong answers.

73
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:41,486
This is just about
your gut-level reactions.

74
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,489
All right, let's begin.

75
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,025
After raising millions
of dollars in grant money

76
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,460
to fund education
for needy children,

77
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:51,796
a fundraising manager
unhappy with this life

78
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,364
fled with all the money

79
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:55,800
and was arrested months later
in Tasmania,

80
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,969
where he was living
under a different name.

81
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,472
So, 1, least punishment:
three months in prison;

82
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:04,642
7 is most severe:
ten years in prison.

83
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:09,881
Please answer now.

84
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:17,554
This is one that I think does
have worldviews on both sides.

85
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,390
[Michael]
 That is a lot of 7s.

86
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,360
 If our control group is
 already maxing out like that,

87
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,629
 well, then our scale
 has no room in that direction

88
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,065
 to show any effect
 of mortality salience.

89
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,368
 Discovering issues like this,
learning how to better isolate

90
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,103
 mortality salience's effect,

91
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,405
 is exactly what a pilot test
 is for.

92
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:37,775
Hey, personal differences, huh?

93
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,345
[woman] An imposter
with no medical training

94
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,680
posed as a surgeon and bungled
a minor operation

95
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,482
to remove a child's tonsils.

96
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:47,552
The patient recovered fully
after additional treatment.

97
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:51,422
1 is six months on probation,
7 is ten years in prison.

98
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,358
[Sheldon]
Okay.

99
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,728
If you are taking on the persona
of a doctor,

100
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:02,967
we would expect good behavior.

101
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,736
[woman] The surgeon botched
the operation

102
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,871
and was found to be under
the influence of narcotics,

103
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,906
causing her to have permanent
hoarseness

104
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:14,712
and ruining her career.

105
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,748
A 16-year-old girl who had just
received her license

106
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,116
drove through a red light,

107
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,817
hitting another car
that was being driven

108
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:25,723
by a talented pianist.

109
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:27,792
A couple was taking their two
children to the playground

110
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,927
when they saw a woman
sunbathing nude.

111
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:32,430
Look at that.
There could be a gender gap.

112
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,866
We're also learning a lot about
the worldviews people have.

113
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:40,872
[Jeff]
Yeah, absolutely.

114
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,040
An anti-government protester
was arrested

115
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,576
for spray-painting profanities
at the Lincoln Memorial

116
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:46,944
in Washington, D.C.

117
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:48,780
1: 40 hours...

118
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,848
Wow, she went 1
right away.

119
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,618
She's not a fan of authority
and rules.

120
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:58,956
[Sheldon]
Yeah.

121
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:01,492
Okay, thank you so much
for your time.

122
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:02,693
We really appreciate it.

123
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,595
All right, so here's the results

124
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:06,697
in a mathematical analysis.

125
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,800
These are averages per question.

126
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,702
These are the averages
and medians per participant.

127
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:14,505
[Jeff] The 4s are great.
The 3's great.

128
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,175
But this is ground
for optimism, at least.

129
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,143
[Michael] 7 was the max
 sentencing value,

130
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:23,714
 and our control group
 gave an average of 4.5.

131
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:25,950
I'm really happy with that
as a control group.

132
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,452
Absolutely.

133
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,587
 Now, our experimental groups.

134
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:32,123
 Remember, they will be seeing
 posters that remind them

135
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,958
 of their own mortality,

136
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,027
 and will be asked
 different questions

137
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,228
 in their questionnaire.

138
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:50,708
 For example...

139
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:54,011
 The point is to prime
 their mortality salience.

140
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,013
 Let's see if this group
 is more punitive

141
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:59,650
 towards worldview
 violations.

142
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,853
After raising millions
of dollars

143
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,955
to fund education
for needy children,

144
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,724
a fundraising manager
fled with all the money

145
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,993
and was arrested months later
in Tasmania.

146
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,062
1: three months in prison;

147
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,164
7: ten years in prison.

148
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:17,568
Please answer now.

149
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,871
Okay, he's thinking
about it.

150
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,207
Please hold up your answers.

151
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,009
All right.
Thank you so much.

152
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:31,182
Ah, okay.

153
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,050
[woman] An imposter
with no medical training

154
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,786
posed as a surgeon and bungled
a minor operation

155
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,054
to remove a child's tonsils.

156
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:39,891
1: six months on probation;

157
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:45,596
7: ten years in prison.

158
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:55,973
-They are thinking a lot more.
-Yeah.

159
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:59,110
-[Sheldon] Wow.
-[Michael] A 10.

160
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,312
I'm pretty sure she knows
that 7 is the highest.

161
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:03,180
[Jeff]
We'll call it a 7.

162
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:05,249
It's funny to see
when people feel bold enough,

163
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,652
even though I'm breaking
the bounds

164
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:13,791
and the rules of the task.

165
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,593
An anti-government protester
was arrested

166
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:18,129
for spray-painting profanities
at the Lincoln Memorial

167
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,633
in Washington, D.C.

168
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:25,169
[Sheldon]
I really do appreciate the way

169
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,739
they clearly seem to be
taking a bit more time

170
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:40,685
-to deliberate.
-Yeah.

171
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,153
Okay, they can put
the papers down,

172
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,988
and tell them that we will be in
shortly.

173
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,656
[woman]
Okay, thank you so much.

174
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,758
We've finished with this part
of the study.

175
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,594
So if you won't mind
hanging out for a moment,

176
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,262
and our researchers
will be in here in a moment

177
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,297
to ask you a couple questions.

178
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:56,067
[Michael] Let's find out
 if the reminders of mortality

179
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,836
 we showed our experimental
 group were salient enough.

180
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,204
[Jeff]
Let me ask you about one thing.

181
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,739
Out in the waiting room,

182
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,208
did you all notice
the posters at all?

183
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,711
[woman]
Yes, they are all death-related.

184
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:11,382
Okay. All right.

185
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:14,919
Yeah.

186
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,120
-That's right.
-[all laugh]

187
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,623
So we are looking into

188
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,692
something that's called
Terror Management Theory.

189
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:25,363
And it's the idea that your own
awareness of your mortality

190
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:29,834
can affect the behaviors
that you exhibit.

191
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,836
That we all manage the terror
that we feel

192
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:36,207
knowing that we are mortal,
by behaving in certain ways,

193
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,175
especially in ways that
reinforce our own worldviews.

194
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:41,212
Because we could kind of live on
through the societies

195
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,414
and cultures and identities
that we have today.

196
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,683
[Jeff] Did any of you feel like
you were still thinking

197
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:48,819
a little bit about death
when you came in here?

198
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,056
I was definitely going
after people who transgressed

199
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,958
against my worldview,
to use your term.

200
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,194
-Yes, I noticed that.
-I was definitely doing that.

201
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:58,963
[Michael]
So this was incredibly helpful.

202
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:00,731
-[Jeff] Yeah.
-[Michael] Thank you very much.

203
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,034
[Jeff] Thanks so much.
I appreciate.

204
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,803
[Michael]
It looks like our experimental
 stimuli were successful.

205
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,738
 They were salient, but didn't
 cause the participants

206
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,774
 to think they were related
 to the study.

207
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:14,745
The control participants
averaged about 4.5.

208
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:18,315
The experimental participants
were close to 4.7,

209
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,217
if we round up.

210
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:24,055
So there's a slight tendency
for the experimental people

211
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,925
to be leaning in the direction
that we predicted.

212
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,226
But we're talking about

213
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,896
relatively inconsequential
differences.

214
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,031
That's right. It just makes me
hungry to run more people.

215
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:35,366
And with the number that we had,

216
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,868
that's statistically
insignificant.

217
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,805
Do you think that we did
see any effects

218
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,940
of mortality salience today?

219
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,209
[Jeff] I feel like the mortality
salient groups

220
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,111
tended to think a little
longer before responding.

221
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,345
Yeah, me too.

222
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,047
[Jeff]
And they seemed more thoughtful.

223
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,982
-They were really--
-They put more effort into it,

224
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:53,784
into trying to do
the right thing.

225
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,187
The difference was dramatic
enough that we picked up on it.

226
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,789
-Absolutely.
 -Although our stimuli

227
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,925
 might need to go through
 more passes and more vetting,

228
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,293
 we did find
 an interesting difference

229
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,494
 in the time it took

230
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,362
 for our groups to respond.

231
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,298
 Our control group took
 an average

232
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,501
 of 4 minutes and 46 seconds
to decide on their punishments,

233
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:12,203
 but our experimental group

234
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,473
 took an average
 of 7 minutes, 18 seconds.

235
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:19,210
In a sense,
that really is the prediction.

236
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,811
The right thing
by their own worldview,

237
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,513
but by the same token,
when we think about death,

238
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,115
we want to do what's right.

239
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,383
And if we're acting
like jurors,

240
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:28,352
we want to make
the right decisions.

241
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,287
As we very much learned today,

242
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:34,024
the goal isn't to prove
one thing one way or the other.

243
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,893
It's just to reduce
uncertainty...

244
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,195
-That's correct.
-...in the most careful way.

245
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:42,333
Absolutely. To know a little bit
more today than yesterday.

246
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:46,804
[Jeff]
Yeah.

247
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:48,172
[Michael]
Our pilot test shows

248
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:50,007
that there's still a lot
to discover

249
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:51,408
about terror management

250
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,310
and many promising ways
to do it.

251
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:56,347
I'm particularly intrigued
by our observation

252
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,016
that for all
the closed-mindedness

253
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:01,118
mortality salience
appears to cause,

254
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:03,154
it also lead
to what looked like

255
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,257
increased consideration
and thought.

256
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,926
I'd love to see more research
on that idea.

257
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,095
But the point is this:

258
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:15,232
if death's effects
aren't all entirely bad,

259
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,401
what if, instead of,

260
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,970
or at least at the same time

261
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,840
that we hope for the abolition
of natural death,

262
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,944
we also find a way
to accept it?

263
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:31,015
Now, obviously I don't
want to die, at least not soon.

264
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,884
But accepting the inevitability
of my own death

265
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:38,823
and being less afraid of it
feels powerful and honest.

266
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,025
I'd like to learn
what that looks like.

267
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:48,432
And I have a friend
who can help.

268
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,568
 I'm paying a visit
 to Caitlin Doughty,

269
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,438
 a mortician, author,
and death positivity activist,

270
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,907
 who has made an entire career
 out of discussing

271
00:12:56,908 --> 00:13:01,078
 the aspects of death that
 most of us prefer to ignore.

272
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,449
What do you say to someone
who comes to you and says,

273
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,552
"I think death is terrifying.
It's...

274
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,088
"so scary and sad

275
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,024
that I'm just here now"?

276
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,893
Is this person dying,
or is this person...?

277
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,862
This person is me
in front of you right now.

278
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,330
This person is you.
Okay, so...

279
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,198
I would tell you
a couple things.

280
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,103
First, you're dealing with
the primal existential quandary

281
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,371
of human existence.

282
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:30,107
-Yes.
-And you are one of, you know,

283
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:33,010
the many billions of people
who have felt this.

284
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,312
So you're not alone
in feeling this way.

285
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,548
So we go through life--
We reach a certain age,

286
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,084
and we begin to understand

287
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,221
that someday ourselves
and everyone we love will die.

288
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:47,958
And that's powerful,
painful knowledge.

289
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,060
And I think from that moment,

290
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:53,030
We have to start developing
defense mechanisms

291
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:56,400
to handle that and to integrate
that into our lives.

292
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,335
So, what are those defense
mechanisms?

293
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:02,439
I think that the more obvious
ones would be having a child,

294
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,975
writing a book,
making a TV show,

295
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,977
creating a legacy
of some kind.

296
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:09,613
But there's also a more
insidious version,

297
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,515
which is war.

298
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,217
Taking other countries.

299
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:16,553
Being rich and being okay with
other people being poor.

300
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,289
I think those are all signs
of death denial.

301
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,657
They're all saying,

302
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,558
"But I'm okay,
because I have this money,

303
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,496
"or I have this power, or I have
these kind of dark impulses

304
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:30,501
that allow me to say, at least
I can outrun death in that way."

305
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,169
And, of course,
that's not true.

306
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,604
No one can outrun death.

307
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,473
But you can trick yourself
into believing that.

308
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,075
So how would you
characterize

309
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:41,011
the Western relationship
to death?

310
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:43,981
Take America 150 years ago.

311
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:47,318
If you were my husband
and you died,

312
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,453
I would be entirely
in charge of you.

313
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,121
I would wash your body.

314
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:54,224
I would get the neighbor
to make a wooden coffin for you.

315
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:57,628
We would put you in the coffin
and carry you on our shoulders,

316
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,663
to the grave which someone
had dug themselves.

317
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:01,298
-Right.
-It would have been

318
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,701
an entirely self-sufficient
process.

319
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,071
But what happened around
the turn of the 20th century

320
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,473
is really three big things
in my mind.

321
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:12,009
One, you had the rise
of hospitals.

322
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,078
So people were no longer
dying at home.

323
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,980
You had the rise
of funeral homes,

324
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,350
which means that we are now
outsourcing our death.

325
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,318
The third one
is slaughterhouses.

326
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:24,388
So all of a sudden,
all food production

327
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,524
and the killing of animals
is also hidden as well.

328
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:30,194
And we live in
our suburban houses,

329
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,162
where all those things
are outsourced.

330
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:36,266
And it's just these layers and
layers of denial around death.

331
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:40,704
But what does it mean
to accept death?

332
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:44,241
I don't think that you ever
truly accept death.

333
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:48,212
But I believe that the movement
toward accepting death

334
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,148
involves really true
self-awareness

335
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,119
about where you're hiding
your fears of death.

336
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,023
That's where real awareness
and acceptance can come from.

337
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,225
For me, the thing that's just
such a bummer about death

338
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,526
is that I just am done.

339
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,728
I don't get to continue
learning things

340
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:07,131
and seeing what happens.

341
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,100
And I'm just not part
of Earth anymore.

342
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:13,337
Isn't death kind of what gives
you that passion,

343
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:14,671
when you think about it?

344
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,640
Like, I love learning,
I love ideas.

345
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:19,610
If you didn't have an end point,
are you going to come in here

346
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:23,213
with all these cameras and do
the huge amount of legwork

347
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:26,083
-that creating a show requires?
-No.

348
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,419
No. Right. Because you're like,
"I don't know, maybe I'll do it

349
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,487
200 years from now."

350
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:33,290
Whereas right now, you're taking
in information left and right,

351
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,591
because you want
to produce content.

352
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:37,061
You want to produce
exciting things

353
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,629
and share with other people...

354
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,065
-Because this is my one chance.
-This is your one chance.

355
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:45,202
The passion and the realness
to life comes from an ending.

356
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:48,105
That's the great gift
that death gives us.

357
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:51,275
What's an unhealthy relationship
to have to your own mortality?

358
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,444
The pursuit of immortality,

359
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,846
and the pursuit of,
"I will stay alive

360
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:58,715
until I can upload my brain
into the cloud."

361
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,217
That worries me.

362
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:01,819
The idea that everyone
is just allowed

363
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,520
to live forever
from here on out

364
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,722
is not environmentally sensible.

365
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:14,431
It's not-- You know, it's just
not a sensible position to take.

366
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,333
[narrator]
 We are seeing the dawn

367
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:19,368
 of a new era
 of possibilities unfold

368
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,171
 on planet Earth.

369
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:24,208
 What will our amazing world
 be like in, say, 80,

370
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,310
 100, or even 200 years
 from now?

371
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,313
 Wouldn't you like
 the possibility

372
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,381
 of finding out?

373
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,417
[Michael]
 To understand why some people

374
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:35,519
 feel like death shouldn't
 be inevitable,

375
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,521
 I've come to Alcor,

376
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:40,224
 one of the world's leading
 life extension facilities.

377
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,192
-Linda. Hi, I'm Michael.
-Hi, how are you?

378
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:44,194
-Great to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

379
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:46,663
-Welcome to Alcor.
-Thank you for having me here.

380
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:48,665
 I'm meeting Linda Chamberlin,

381
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,602
 who co-founded Alcor
 nearly 46 years ago.

382
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,504
So this facility that we are in
right now

383
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,841
is where you both cryo-preserve
people and store them.

384
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:02,146
[Linda]
Yes. We have 160 patients.

385
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,481
-Wow.
-And we have

386
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:08,585
eleven hundred
and ninety-something members.

387
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:10,420
-It changes.
-And a member is someone

388
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:12,789
-who is alive today but has...
-Alive today.

389
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,759
They've made the arrangements
for this.

390
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,929
Once they are cryo-preserved,
they become patients.

391
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,330
You're using
the word "patient."

392
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:21,532
-Yes.
-Okay.

393
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,433
Tell me about why you use
that word.

394
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:27,271
For us, death is not something
which is like an on/off switch.

395
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,207
One second you're alive,
the next second you're dead.

396
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,543
-Mm-hmm.
-What we are trying to do

397
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,446
is to slow down and stop
the dying process.

398
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,348
[Michael]
 To become a patient at Alcor,

399
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:42,386
 first you have to pay
 between 80 and $200,000

400
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,488
 Then you have to die,

401
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:48,225
 or more specifically,
be pronounced clinically dead.

402
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,494
 This generally means
 that your heart and lungs

403
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,929
 have stopped functioning.

404
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,531
 At that point,
 Alcor can begin their work.

405
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,867
Now, there are two ways
that a person could sign up

406
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,535
for this procedure.

407
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:01,972
There's a whole-body patient,
or as a neuro.

408
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,607
Oh, and does "neuro"
just mean head?

409
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,909
It means, yes,
the cephalon, actually,

410
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,745
which is all of the structures
down to about the clavicle.

411
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,781
-Uh-huh.
-I'm a neuro.

412
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:15,319
Everybody in my family,
who's now in stasis, is a neuro.

413
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,720
-Really?
-Most of the people

414
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:21,358
who really understand
the technology are neuros.

415
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,629
The primary reason that people
choose whole body is emotional.

416
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,232
-Of course.
-And they're not comfortable

417
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:32,736
with the idea of their body
being removed and discarded.

418
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:37,274
So let's say that our patient
is whole body.

419
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,643
The moment the patient
is pronounced,

420
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,011
they go into an ice bath.

421
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,347
And this is just crushed ice.

422
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,282
And it's water
in there as well.

423
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:48,485
Their heart has started again
with a mechanical thumper.

424
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:51,888
They're intubated, and their
lungs are functioning again.

425
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:53,390
Being ventilated.

426
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,759
Circulating the cooler
temperatures.

427
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,761
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So you need the veins,

428
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:59,563
the arteries,
the vasculature, the heart.

429
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:03,567
You need all of those continuing
to pump and circulate.

430
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:05,736
[Linda]
This is our operating room.

431
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,937
[Michael]
Wow.

432
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,672
So basically,

433
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,808
when the patient comes in
through the door there,

434
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,346
they'll go into this specially
developed operating table.

435
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:21,818
It is going to be circulating
nitrogen gas over them

436
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:24,021
to help cool them externally.

437
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,490
And if it's a whole-body
patient,

438
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,760
then the surgeons
open the chest,

439
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,630
and then we begin circulating
the organ transplant solution.

440
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:35,699
[Michael]
 Once in the operating room,

441
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,301
 the patient's blood
 is replaced

442
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,503
 with cooled organ
 transplant fluid

443
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,672
 and circulated
 through the vascular system

444
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,507
 to rapidly cool down
 the internal

445
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,475
 and external temperatures
 of the body.

446
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:47,744
 Just before the water
 within the body tissue

447
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,546
 reaches its freezing point,

448
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:52,049
 cryo-protective fluids
 are introduced.

449
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,984
 These act like antifreeze,

450
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,986
 preventing the formation
 of ice crystals

451
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:58,422
 that could damage
 soft tissue.

452
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,758
 This is called
 the vitrification process.

453
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,328
Now, say that it is
a neuro patient.

454
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,531
-So they come in first here.
-Yup, their whole body.

455
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,701
Right. The surgeons will do
the neuro separation first.

456
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,903
-Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
-Separate the cephalon,

457
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:16,073
which is all of the structures
down to about the clavicle.

458
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,942
Bring it over here

459
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:24,348
to this operating field.

460
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,882
We'll wash the blood out.

461
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:29,086
And we introduce the organ
transplant solution.

462
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,889
I'm imagining
a person's cephalon,

463
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,591
essentially their head,
in here.

464
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,760
I can see how it's going
to get clamped in.

465
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:38,128
[Linda]
Yeah.

466
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:40,731
[Michael]
That looks like, I'm sure,

467
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,666
a crazy sci-fi movie.

468
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,635
-But it really happens.
-It really happens.

469
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,871
[Michael]
After the vitrification process
 is complete,

470
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:49,973
 the patients are placed
 inside bags

471
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,442
 that are attached
 to open metal cases,

472
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,644
 which are then placed inside
 cylindrical tanks

473
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:58,048
 filled with liquid nitrogen,
 called dewars.

474
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,083
So this is our
patient care bay.

475
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:02,152
We have 159 patients.

476
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:05,155
-In these tanks right here?
-In these tanks.

477
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:08,992
There are approximately

478
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,161
nine patients
in each one of these.

479
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:14,831
Four whole bodies
and five neuros.

480
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:17,901
This one right here

481
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:21,571
is where my husband
is currently housed.

482
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:23,039
-This one right here?
-Right.

483
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,142
This is where Fred is
at the moment.

484
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:29,479
My mother and my father-in-law
are...

485
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,814
in this one.

486
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:32,949
[Michael]
Wow, it's so weird,

487
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,721
because I am right now
not in a graveyard.

488
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:42,058
No. Alcor is very much
like an ambulance

489
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,694
taking their loved ones
to a hospital

490
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:45,962
not down the street,

491
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:48,432
-but a hospital in the future.
-Yeah.

492
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,001
When technology
can help them.

493
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,470
They're not being transported
through space,

494
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,605
-but through time.
-Time.

495
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:59,075
[Michael] To see what drives
this time-traveling ambulance,

496
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:01,077
 I'm going to sit down
 with Max More,

497
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:05,816
 Alcor's CEO,
 and a future neuro patient.

498
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,819
So, Max, what's the status
of the technology needed

499
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,788
to revive cryo-preserved
specimens?

500
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,623
-Are we getting closer?
-We are getting closer.

501
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:14,958
It's going to be decades,
at least,

502
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,794
before we can bring back
whole human beings.

503
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:21,998
But we already cryo-preserve
eggs, sperm,

504
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:23,233
microbes of skin, corneas,

505
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:25,035
heart valves,
all kinds of things.

506
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,471
So those are single tissues.
And we can reverse that process.

507
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,573
-Mm-hmm.
-You move from that to an organ,

508
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,007
things get more difficult.

509
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,478
But we actually did an
experiment a few years ago.

510
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,012
We took this little tiny worm.

511
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:37,881
We used a certain chemical
so we'd learn that,

512
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:39,816
oh, my food's over here
and not over here.

513
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:41,117
And we cryo-preserved them.

514
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:43,520
And then we just waited,
brought them back,

515
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,021
and then we tested them.

516
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:46,890
We were able to demonstrate
with the memory test

517
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,658
that the ones that have received
the training

518
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,126
retained that memory.

519
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:51,628
So it was the first time
any organism

520
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,196
we've proven to survive
with memory.

521
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,832
So now we're asking, okay,
what's the next step?

522
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,635
Because whole organisms are
difficult to reverse right now.

523
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,570
But step by step,
the more progress we can make,

524
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:03,006
-the more convincing this is.
-Wow.

525
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:04,941
When it comes
to extending life,

526
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:08,144
some questions come up, like,
"should people die?"

527
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:11,748
I know we don't like
the idea of death.

528
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,783
-I know what you're getting at.
-But you lose something

529
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:14,985
by getting rid of death.

530
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,586
Yeah, we'll lose something

531
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,288
like we lost something
when we got rid of slavery

532
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,056
or smallpox.

533
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:22,926
So I think people...

534
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,762
people are tying themselves
in knots to rationalize death.

535
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:27,531
I believe that,
right now,

536
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,533
we're kind of in
this tragic situation where,

537
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,268
over time, hopefully
you kind of learn.

538
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,702
Your wisdom grows over time.

539
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:34,104
At the same time,

540
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,972
your cognitive and physical
health is declining.

541
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,241
That really sucks.
That's a bad situation.

542
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:40,176
What if they both could keep
going up indefinitely?

543
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:42,212
So you could live for hundreds
of years or longer,

544
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,848
and get smarter, and more
knowledgeable, and wiser.

545
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,083
Hopefully more mature,
and have more foresight

546
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:49,553
because you got a much longer
planning horizon.

547
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,922
What we'll have is a world
of, I call, ultra-mature people,

548
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,690
which I think will actually
be a better world

549
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:55,158
than the one
we have today.

550
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,827
And if they say, well--
And this comes up all the time.

551
00:24:57,828 --> 00:24:59,996
They say, "Well, death is what
gives life meaning."

552
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:01,965
Bullshit, okay?
If that was true,

553
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:05,302
then would they also advocate
people who live to 90

554
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,937
should be killed off at 45?

555
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,738
Will that double the meaning
in their life?

556
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:11,241
In fact, I think life gets more
meaning the longer you live,

557
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:13,977
because you can build
on what you've done before.

558
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:16,112
So if anything, it increases
the meaningfulness of life,

559
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:17,714
in my view.

560
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:19,983
You're making me realize
that, in many ways,

561
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:24,688
I am rationalizing death.

562
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,724
I'm looking for ways
to excuse it and accept it.

563
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:31,328
I don't think it's unhealthy
to accept that you are mortal.

564
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,762
Well, I have to accept it,

565
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:34,297
because I could get killed
at any time.

566
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:35,932
One thing I have to stress,

567
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,701
because every
article written,

568
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,235
they always have to use
the word "forever,"

569
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:40,837
or "immortality."

570
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,606
And that's not
on the table here.

571
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,374
We're just offering a chance
for people to be revived

572
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,942
when we've beaten aging.

573
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,978
And eventually something's
going to get you.

574
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,813
So we're not offering
immortality.

575
00:25:49,814 --> 00:26:01,958
We're offering an unknown
extension of human lifespan.

576
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:06,396
Do I think that someday we will
be able to cryonically freeze

577
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:11,101
an entire person
and then revive them?

578
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,302
Yes, I do.

579
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,070
I believe that
cryopreservation

580
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:16,706
will change the meaning
of death,

581
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,175
and lead to breakthroughs
in medical technology

582
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:22,012
that will improve
all of our lives.

583
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:26,983
But do I want to extend my life
indefinitely?

584
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,852
Well, on the one hand,

585
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,021
obviously death
is a bummer.

586
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,389
But on the other,

587
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,325
the universe managed fine
without me

588
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:37,727
for billions of years.

589
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,863
Am I really so important

590
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,832
that it should never
not have me again?

591
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:46,269
Should I be around
as long as possible?

592
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,941
Or do those who will come later
deserve their own world?

593
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:54,978
Should I try
to extend my life?

594
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:59,983
Or should I decide to die
when my time comes

595
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:03,787
and return all this matter
I'm borrowing back to the world?

596
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,389
Well, I don't think
there's a right answer.

597
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,693
It's a personal choice
we each get to make,

598
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,394
and should be able to make.

599
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:18,935
And I've been thinking
about it a lot.

600
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,771
 So I'm going to speak again
 with my friend Caitlin,

601
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:25,875
 the mortician,
 to confront my own mortality.

602
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:27,744
Well, Caitlin, thanks for
meeting with me again.

603
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:29,713
I've been surrounded
by death lately.

604
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,815
Spoke to you.
I visited Alcor.

605
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,850
And, you know,

606
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:36,419
if we never invented technology
to bring people back,

607
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,855
then the Alcor patients
are dead.

608
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,424
But they have that hope.

609
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:44,060
I worked on
Terror Management Theory.

610
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:47,497
And I even had a loved one
pass away just two weeks ago.

611
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:51,101
-My grandmother.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

612
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,270
She was cremated,
as was my father.

613
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,339
And I realized, you know,

614
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,878
I've never made a clear decision
about what should happen to me.

615
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,847
Because I just figured

616
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,215
I'll figure that out
when I'm older.

617
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,183
-But I could die at any time.
-You sure could.

618
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:09,285
So I want to be prepared.

619
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,221
And I want my wishes
to be known.

620
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,490
-Yeah.
-So I have decided

621
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,158
when that moment comes,

622
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,262
I want it to be my final moment
of existence.

623
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:22,832
I want to give all my atoms and
molecules back to the universe.

624
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,802
And I've decided that
I want to die.

625
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,904
Oh, I'm so glad
you've made that decision.

626
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:29,172
And you've come
to the right place.

627
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:33,143
I want to be naturally buried.

628
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,811
I want to have a green burial.

629
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:37,881
You know, become worm food
and plant food.

630
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,449
I want it all
to go back to earth.

631
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,319
But I kind of want a place
where people can come

632
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,923
to be like,
that's where he was buried.

633
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:52,095
So there's everything from
just little discs in the ground

634
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,497
where you are,
to GPS that locates you,

635
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,533
to natural cemeteries

636
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,535
that are trying to reintroduce
native plants.

637
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,236
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-So, you know,

638
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:02,472
you can have your own
Joshua tree.

639
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:05,508
So the first thing I'm going
to give you to give a look over

640
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,310
is what's called
an advanced directive.

641
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:08,912
-Okay.
-And everybody needs

642
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,413
to have one of these.

643
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:14,350
And why it's so important
is that it's you

644
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:17,954
not only designating someone
to be in charge of your body

645
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:20,323
as you're dying,
right after you die,

646
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:22,926
and then with however you decide
to dispose of it.

647
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,195
But also who that person is.

648
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:29,098
So this isn't just about burial.
This is dying.

649
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,934
It's about death, dying,
death and after death.

650
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,168
-Interesting.
-Mm-hmm.

651
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:33,369
[Michael]
 A choice like this

652
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,104
 is extremely new to humans.

653
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:38,842
It used to be your only options
 upon death

654
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:42,579
 were cremation, embalming,
 or rotting away.

655
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,316
 But today, you can chose to
pause yourself at death's door

656
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,118
 until the door has been moved
 somewhere else.

657
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,222
 But I've decided
 not to do that.

658
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,390
So I'm ready to make this
official.

659
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:59,562
-Fire in the hole.
-Okay.

660
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,865
-Whoo! All right.
-How do you feel?

661
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,634
Weirdly, I feel
very relaxed and good.

662
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,203
It was kind of life-changing,
but what it really was

663
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:09,272
was death-changing.

664
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:11,374
Ha, well, thank you, and
I'm glad you've decided to die.

665
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,009
Thank you.

666
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,944
 Jeff and Sheldon,

667
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:17,914
 thank you for showing me
the power of death's influence.

668
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:20,617
 Caitlin, thank you
 for helping me accept it.

669
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,919
 Max, thank you for the work
 you are doing

670
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,221
 and the opportunities
 you are offering humanity.

671
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:29,961
 And, all you out there,
as always, thanks for watching.
