00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:05,728
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. I've been watching
Bravest Warriors on Cartoon Hangover lately.

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:11,579
It's great, it was created by Pendleton Ward,
and in the show teenagers zip around the universe

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:20,479
visiting star systems and planets and here
is my question: When will we do the same?

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,639
Us humans, in real life.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,459
I mean, we've managed to put people on the
Moon, and land robots on asteroids, and Mars,

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,239
and even Titan, a moon of Saturn.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:41,169
Interplanetary travel is scary cool.
But will we ever travel interstellarly? Certainly

8
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:47,898
it will happen, right? I mean, Voyager 1 is
expected to reach interstellar space sometime

9
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:55,578
this year, or maybe in the next year or two.
And it was launched way back in 1977. So,

10
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:01,328
shows like Bravest Warriors are pretty much
just a glimpse of our future, maybe even one

11
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:07,079
within our lifetimes. Right?

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,969
Well, we're going to need a DONG for this one. Something you

13
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,199
can Do Online Now Guys.

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,919
The Hayden Planetarium's digital universe
allows you to explore a 3-dimensional map

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,419
of our Milky Way. Now, there are about 81
visible stars within just 20 lightyears of

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,979
our own Sun. The nearest is Proximus Centauri,
which is only 4.3 lightyears away.

17
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:42,309
Getting there? Piece of cake. Piece of difficult
cake, because a lightyear is an incredibly

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:48,499
long distance. It's the distance that light
in a vacuum will travel in an entire year.

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,419
And in just one second light can travel
so far as to circle the entire Equator of

20
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,779
Earth...7 times.

21
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:08,817
Now, a fast bullet can travel at about 1,500 m/s.
And Voyager 1 is traveling at about 17,000

22
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:15,168
m/s, relative to the Sun. Also relative to
the Sun, our Earth is orbiting at a speed

23
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:23,988
of 29,800 m/s - that's pretty fast.
But the fastest man-made object ever was the Helios

24
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:32,659
2 Solar Probe,
which traveled at a maximum speed of 70,220 m/s.

25
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:40,639
Impressive, right? Well, even at that speed,
the fastest speed ever reached by any man

26
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,979
made object, crossing this little ol' gap
and reaching Proximus Centauri would take

27
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,639
19,000 years.

28
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,399
But technology in the future is bound to be
improved, along with the maximum speeds we

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,179
are able to obtain. Even using what we know
now, a solar sail could easily provide the

30
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:10,248
acceleration needed to reach near-lightspeed speeds.
And our current understanding of physics theoretically

31
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:15,929
allows for things like wormholes which, in
theory, could move a spacecraft from one point

32
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,639
in space to another faster than light normally could.

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,448
And who could forget the famous Alcubierre drive?
An idea that fits within most models

34
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:31,998
of our universe, and proposes a way to deliver
a space craft to a distant object faster than

35
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:39,179
light can get there - not by moving the spacecraft,
but, instead, by collapsing and expanding

36
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,419
space itself.

37
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,108
Things like wormholes and Alcubierre drives
are theoretical, but if they could one day

38
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:54,948
become a reality, how far away might that day be?
It matters. And figuring out exactly

39
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:02,198
when in time we should begin an interstellar
journey is called a Wait Calculation. Leave

40
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:09,378
too soon and before a ship launched today,
full of frozen embryos, ever got to its destination

41
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:15,308
it would be passed by astronauts who left
hundreds, or thousands, of years later, at

42
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:21,448
a point in time when technology was advanced
enough to lap what we have today.

43
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:26,769
Andrew Kennedy calculated that given the
pace of our progress, as far as travel velocity

44
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,008
is concerned,
and Earth's mean annual economic growth,

45
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:37,288
the soonest human civilization might ever
reach Bernard Star, 6 lightyears away, is

46
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:48,038
1,104 years from today, which isn't within
any of our lifetimes. It might also be a bit

47
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,348
optimistic because it assumes that we not
only solve the problem of speed, but that

48
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:58,688
we also solve problems like "how to survive
interstellar radiation for years?" or "how

49
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:03,359
to avoid collisions with interstellar
material at high speeds?"

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,198
It also assumes that before we achieve the
technology needed to successfully interstellarly

51
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:17,489
travel, all of human kind isn't wiped out
by some cataclysmic natural disaster. It may

52
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,698
sound unlikely, but we're not talking about
the near-future, we're talking about thousands

53
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:29,859
of years from now. Let's put it this way.
Even given our current, slow means of space

54
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,008
travel, it's estimated that within 5 to 50 million
years, we could theoretically explore and

55
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,219
colonize our whole galaxy.

56
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:46,459
That's a lot of time, though. In fact, statistically
speaking, within the next 500,000 years, it's

57
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:54,279
very likely that Earth will encounter a meteorite
nearly a kilometer across. Hopefully when

58
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,348
that happens we have the prevention abilities
needed to keep ourselves safe. But given

59
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:06,668
all of this information it's easy to see why
the 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference concluded

60
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:14,119
that it was improbable that humans would ever
explore beyond the solar system.

61
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,318
It's quite depressing to think that scenes
like this one from Shutterstock may be destined

62
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,579
to only ever remain that - science fiction.

63
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,049
Wait, how quickly is the camera moving in

64
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,508
that clip? We're used to seeing science fiction
scenes like this, but a Nebula tends to be

65
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,329
lightyears across, which means that in this
clip we're traveling at least the speed of

66
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,079
light, if not faster.
Would it really look like that?

67
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,468
I covered this briefly in my black hole video,
but not completely. If you were to travel

68
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:58,329
at the speed of light, or near the speed of
light, the universe ahead of you wouldn't

69
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,989
look like it usually did. First of all, your
field of view would increase. It would appear

70
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,318
as if the universe was receding away from
you as you accelerated. At the same time,

71
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,559
all of the light reaching you would be blueshifted
until you were left with this. You may have

72
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,848
seen this on Vsauce 2. It's the cosmic background
radiation blueshifted all-the-way up into

73
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,699
the visible range.

74
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,538
MIT Game Lab offers a free, downloadable game
that puts you in an environment where the

75
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:38,028
speed of light can be lowered all-the-way
down to typical walking speed. You can experience

76
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:43,038
all of the visual effects I just discussed,
but I wanted to know what it would look like

77
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,188
if the speed of light was where it is, and
I took a journey from Earth to the Moon.

78
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:53,848
So, I enlisted my friend Liam from World of
the Orange and New Music to put together a

79
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:59,908
simulation of what it might actually look
like to accelerate to nearly the speed of

80
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:11,979
light and then slow down,
during a trip from Earth to the Moon. Enjoy.

81
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,418
Whether or not you should believe that all
the right factors will come together and humans

82
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:22,829
will one day travel that quickly or reach
interstellar destinations largely comes down

83
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,058
to whether you want to be an optimist or a
pessimist. But what we've accomplished so

84
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:35,598
far is quite amazing considering how weak,
flimsy and vulnerable the human body is in

85
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,819
the vacuum of space.

86
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,379
Bad Astronomer and SciShow have great videos
discussing this topic. And now, thanks to

87
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:51,148
the brilliant team at Bravest Warriors, I'm
going to go to space. But not while wearing

88
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:58,289
a Vsauce suit, no, no, no, I'll do it naked.
Whoa. Ok, not that naked. And also maybe some

89
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,198
muscles?
Yep, so that's pretty much what I'd look like.

90
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:06,739
The moment I'm exposed to the vacuum of space
my body would not inflate and explode. Now,

91
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:13,609
the body is a very nicely contained system.
But those parts of me that aren't well contained...they'll

92
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:20,569
be the first to go. The air in my lungs and
digestive tract would quickly rush out. Moist,

93
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,119
soft tissues would rapidly lose water.
My mouth and lips and eyes would dry out and

94
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,539
swell. As water was pulled to the surface
of these things it would vaporize, and the

95
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,088
decrease in its pressure would cool my mouth
and eyes to near-freezing. My body would inflate

96
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:42,869
to about twice its normal size as gasses in
my blood came out of solution, slowly evaporating

97
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,268
away, cooling the surface of my skin.
Oh, and the blood vessels in my eyes would likely

98
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,638
burst, spilling blood into my eyes which,
along with all the other fluid in my eyes,

99
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,528
would be rapidly vaporizing on the surface,
freezing and drying them out.

100
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:03,508
Within about 15 seconds I would go unconscious
because oxygen wasn't reaching my brain. And,

101
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:09,129
as far as I'm concerned, that would be the
end of the entire ordeal. For another 90 seconds

102
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:15,419
or so I would still, technically, be alive,
but I wouldn't be aware of it or remember

103
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:22,689
any of it. My dead body would remain, internally,
quite warm for a while because in the near

104
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,789
vacuum of space there isn't much matter to
conduct of convect heat away from me. Instead,

105
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:35,159
I would really only lose heat through radiation,
a much less efficient method. It would take

106
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,619
hours for me to cool down to the temperature
of space, and by then, I would be nothing

107
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:47,139
but a dried-up piece of slightly bloated and
stretched, dessicated human jerky.

108
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,809
If I was exposed to the Sun's full-on radiation,
not filtered by the usual atmosphere of Earth,

109
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,138
I would be a grossly sunburnt piece of jerky.

110
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:02,549
In case that makes you hungry, let me give
you some nutritional facts: 200 pounds of

111
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:09,739
human meat, in outer space, would eventually
become about 120 pounds of freeze-dried jerky.

112
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:16,479
And given what would be left of me that would
be edible as a snack, I'd be worth about 115,000

113
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,469
calories.

114
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,749
Maybe humans are the only intelligent life
in the universe. But if you believe that intelligent

115
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:32,559
life could have arisen on other planets,
an interesting idea occurs: The Fermi Paradox.

116
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,619
Enrico Fermi calculated that given the number
of planets believed to exist in our galaxy,

117
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,299
at least some of them must have been habitable
to life as we know it. And, in many cases,

118
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,749
millions and millions of years before life
on Earth even existed.

119
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,078
So, if interstellar travel, traveling between
stars and different solar systems, really

120
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:04,999
is possible for intelligent life to do, why
have we not been visited by aliens yet? Well,

121
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,068
maybe we have been visited. Maybe they're
here right now and we just can't perceive

122
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:18,219
them. Or maybe we haven't been discovered.
Or maybe we are alone. Or maybe we're just

123
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,059
not worth visiting...

124
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,528
So, what are you waiting for? Live your life
in a way that makes traveling lightyears just

125
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,388
to hang out with you worth it.

126
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,328
And as always,

127
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,529
thanks for watching.
