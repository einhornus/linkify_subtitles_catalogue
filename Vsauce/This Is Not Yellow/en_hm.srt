00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:07,359
Using GPS, these trails represent pizza delivery
in Manhattan on a typical Friday night.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,519
And is this a frog or a orse?

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,939
It's episode 52 of IMG!

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,799
This lemon looks yellow to me, and it probably
looks yellow to you as well, but not in

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,738
the same way. You see, here in this room,
this lemon is "Subtractively Yellow." It absorbs

6
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,369
all visible wavelengths of light except for
yellow light, which it reflects onto my retina.

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:43,589
But the screen that you are using to watch
this video doesn't produce yellow light at

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,029
all. In fact, it can only produce red, blue,
or green light. The really cool, but kind

9
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,729
of disturbing thing about this is that here
in the room, I am actually seeing "real" yellow

10
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:02,909
light. But you are seeing "fake" yellow. Absolutely
no yellow is coming off your screen and falling

11
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,669
onto your retina. But it still looks yellow
because it's quite easy to lie to the brain.

12
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,249
Our retinas contain three different types
of cone cells that are receptive to color

13
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,279
and each one is best suited to detect a certain
color. One is great for blue, the other is

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,559
great for green and the third is great for
red. Notice that there is no individual cell

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,999
looking for yellow. So, the way we actually
see yellow happens like this. The wavelength

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,048
of yellow light falls between the wavelengths
of red and green. And, so, when an object

17
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:44,108
reflects yellow light onto your retina, both
the green and the red cones are slightly activated,

18
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:48,108
which your brain notices and says "well, that's
what happens when something's yellow, so it

19
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,069
must be yellow."

20
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,429
All a computer monitor or a mobile phone screen
has to do to make you think you're seeing

21
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,938
yellow is send a little bit of red and a little
bit of green light at you. As long as the

22
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,949
pixels and the little subpixels on them are
small enough that you can't distinguish them

23
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,909
individually, your brain will just say "well,
I'm recieving some red and some green, that's

24
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:17,679
what yellow things do...hmm...it must be yellow."
Even though it actually is not...

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,939
Lemons can also produce electricity. A little
bit of zinc, a little bit of copper, and boom,

26
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,099
you're moving electrons around. But not that
many, I mean, the current voltage are quite

27
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,839
low.
You could run an LCD, but even a potato could do that...

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,589
If you wanted to run a flashlight bulb, that
would take 3,000 lemons. And if you wanted

29
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,348
to run a halogen bulb, well, that would take
37,000 lemons. But artist Caleb Charland

30
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,779
doesn't care.

31
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,859
He spent 11 hours hammering nails into 300
living apples hanging on trees. By connecting

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,999
them to a household lamp, he was able to make
it glow just dimly enough to capture this

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,779
image with a 4 hour exposure.

34
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,099
Less alive and more frightening are Steve
Shaheen's sculptures: little dudes with bulb

35
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,738
heads desperately trying to plug themselves in.

36
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,988
Merve Kahraman's "Revitalizer" never dies.
It's a lightbulb surrounded by wax. Now, the

37
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,919
wax melts because of the lightbulbs heat,
and drips into a special container into all

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,518
kinds of weird new shapes, but whenever you
want you can just flip it so that the new,

39
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,939
cooled wax is at the top.

40
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,819
But my favorite is the Fukusada wooden lightbulb.
It looks like a solid block of wood, but it's

41
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:40,938
actually hollow and chipped to a nearly paper-thin
width. When you turn it on you can see the

42
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,899
light coming from inside.

43
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,319
Combos.

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:53,399
Artist Tang Yau Hoong blew my mind this week.
We've got clear days and smoke, boats and

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:04,359
crocs, whales and hearts, Pie-bike, brains
and boxing gloves, day and night, but don't

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,159
be scared, you can always paint yourself some
light. Or just swing on some light.

47
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,619
Ok, let's frame it this way. Climbing Wall.
This fitness club in Japan uses frames and

48
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,459
other pretty interior elements to create a
decidedly less rugged climbing wall.

49
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,889
But let's get simple. Like, minimal.

50
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:46,079
Thanks to Lego, here are their bricks arranged
to represent famous characters. Enjoy.

51
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,739
Now for some Art Illusions.

52
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,119
Here's a cute couple, but can you see, in
this very same image, the baby they will soon

53
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,329
have? Or how about these zebras? There's
a lion hiding amongst them. Can you find it?

54
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,449
Billboards can be clever, but here's a great
one that makes it look like someone is pushing

55
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,159
out a section of the building.

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,139
But how many of you will remember seeing it?
If we assume that you don't remember experiencing

57
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,519
major cultural events before you're 5 or 6
years old, that means that every year there

58
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,039
are fewer and fewer people alive who remember
experiencing recent historical events.

59
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,689
xkcd made this amazing chart to show when,
in the future, the majority, more than half

60
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,649
of living americans, will not remember being
alive when certain things happened. For instance,

61
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:46,589
he calculated using data from the US Census
Bureau that 2012, this very year, is the

62
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:54,009
first year in American history since in which
fewer than half of living Americans remember

63
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,099
being alive in the 1970's.

64
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,859
By 2041, most of us won't remember a time
when Pluto was actually called a planet. By

65
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:10,029
2043, most of us alive won't remember living
during George W. Bush's presidency. And by

66
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:16,069
2047, more than half of living Americans
will not have been alive to have remembered

67
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,439
anything that you did today.

68
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,189
Like when you made that funny face in the
yearbook. No, no, no, THAT funny face.

69
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,729
If you're not following @tweetsauce, you're
missing out on daily Vsaucey content, most

70
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,249
of which never makes it to a video. So go
follow us on Twitter and I'm gonna leave you

71
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,049
with another combo. A tessellation, while you
listen to Jake Chudnow's "Flan." He made a

72
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,169
music video for this song over on his channel,
so check that out.

73
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,569
And as always,

74
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,030
thanks for watching.
