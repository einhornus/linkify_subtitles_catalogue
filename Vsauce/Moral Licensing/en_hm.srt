1
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:13,812
Moral psychology isn't always
an easy thing to study.

2
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,314
First of all,
just using a survey

3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,783
to ask people
what they think is moral

4
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:22,754
doesn't always reveal what they
would do in real life.

5
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:25,356
An experiment that actually
puts people

6
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:27,358
in what feels like
a real scenario

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,461
may get more realistic results,

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,796
but researchers must always
balance the benefits

9
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:32,997
of what we could learn

10
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:38,403
with the safety and well-being
of the people they study.

11
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:41,806
Secondly, what we learn from
moral psychology experiments

12
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,509
doesn't always make humans
look good.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,546
For example, today we're going
to look at moral licensing:

14
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:52,884
the theory that when you do
something good...

15
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:56,421
you subconsciously feel
you've earned a license

16
00:00:56,422 --> 00:01:21,312
to then do something bad.

17
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,515
 I've been working
 with Dr. Kyle Stanford,

18
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,550
 from the Department of Logic
 and Philosophy of Science

19
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:27,418
 at the University
 of California, Irvine,

20
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:31,322
 on a way to observe
 moral licensing in the wild.

21
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:34,559
So I want to see moral licensing
in effect.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,629
I want to see people
who have been led to believe,

23
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,765
through their own actions,
that they're good.

24
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,468
Use that feeling

25
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:44,836
to do bad.

26
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,704
The thing to keep in mind,

27
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:48,373
it's like people
are keeping tabs,

28
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,241
and they give themselves credit
for the moral...

29
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:51,809
the good thing they did.

30
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,312
But none of that is happening
consciously, right?

31
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:56,514
So we shouldn't imagine
that a person who's engaged

32
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:59,617
in moral licensing is asking
themselves in their head...

33
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:00,718
Right, pulling out
their scorecard.

34
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,787
...what should I be?
Does it make me a good person?

35
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,422
But it is going on,
and they don't experience it.

36
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,591
-They don't know that it's
happening. 
-Right.

37
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,692
I think we're going to learn
a lot today.

38
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,695
-I say we go get started.
 -Let's do it.

39
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:16,834
Let's do it.

40
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,670
[Michael] So here's how
 the moral licensing test

41
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,538
 we designed is going to work.

42
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,840
 First, we're going to take
 this beautiful park

43
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,943
 and, for the purposes
 of science,

44
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,811
 throw trash everywhere.

45
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:29,814
 Next, we've hired
 some unsuspecting actors

46
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,350
 who think they're going to film
 a public service announcement

47
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,585
 about the park.

48
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,752
-Hey, Jake. Hey, man.
-Hi.

49
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:36,654
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:37,889
 Once they've arrived,

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,392
 it will be obvious
 that the trash is a problem.

52
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:44,495
We just need to clean up this
little alleyway right here.

53
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,732
 Will they do a good deed
 and earn some moral credit

54
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,568
 by volunteering to help
 pick up the trash, or not?

55
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,837
 And to make everything
 feel more real,

56
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:55,607
 we did have them film
 our fake PSA.

57
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,542
Forget the concrete
and the heat.

58
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,812
Relax in over
16,000 square feet.

59
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,981
Of outdoor space
that can't be beat.

60
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,716
Right outside your door.

61
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,251
Right outside
your door.

62
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,019
Right outside your door.

63
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,387
 After shooting the PSA,

64
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:12,490
 each participant will be asked
 to wait in a separate area

65
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,925
 for some final paperwork.

66
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:16,995
 There, our confederate Cameron,
 who appears to be homeless,

67
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,230
 will ask them for money.

68
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,865
 Meanwhile, Dr. Stanford and I
 will be watching

69
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:24,269
 behind the scenes to observe
 how our subjects react.

70
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,803
 So, will our participants

71
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:28,406
 keep their subconscious
 moral scorecards balanced

72
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:31,476
 by giving money
 when they didn't clean,

73
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:42,654
 or feeling like they don't need
 to give money if they did?

74
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,888
-Hey!
-Makaylo.

75
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,456
Makaylo, nice to meet you.

76
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,592
 First up in our demo
 was Makaylo.

77
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:49,894
 We used our actual
 Mind Field crew

78
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,629
 as the crew of the fake PSA

79
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,531
 who are overwhelmed
 with the task

80
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:54,966
 of cleaning up
 all the trash.

81
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:58,636
We normally sort of
never ask this, but...

82
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,872
we've got, like, all this stuff
that we're trying to clean up.

83
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,707
I'm going to grab some gloves.
I was wondering,

84
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,742
would you help me?

85
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,476
-I'm sorry...
-Let's do it. Let's do it.

86
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:06,711
All three of us
can triple-team it.

87
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:09,714
-and we can get this thing
going.
-Let's do it. Let's do it.

88
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,016
Yeah, this is just
what we wanted to do today.

89
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:14,385
It looks like someone
had a good time, though.

90
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:15,987
[Michael] All right,
so picking up the trash.

91
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,754
How do you think
that's currently sitting

92
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:19,490
with our actor?

93
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:21,592
He's thinking of himself as
having done a good deed

94
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,795
that he didn't need to do,
that he didn't have to do.

95
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,497
Right? And so the moral credit
is high.

96
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:29,467
[Michael] Then it was time
 to shoot our PSA.

97
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:30,702
[man]
Take it away.

98
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,804
Forget the concrete
and the heat.

99
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,406
Relax in 16,000
square feet.

100
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,108
[man]
That was great! All right, man.

101
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:39,477
-Hey, thanks so much.
-Cool. No problem, man.

102
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,880
 We compensated our participants
 for the PSA in small bills

103
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:45,049
 so they would have plenty
 to give the homeless man,

104
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,851
 should they choose to do so.

105
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,953
-Here's $50.
-Thank you, thank you.

106
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:51,122
 Then we asked them to wait
 in a nearby tent

107
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,990
 for their final paperwork.

108
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,626
 Will Makaylo's good deed
 be enough moral credit

109
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:58,062
 for him to pass on
 helping the homeless guy?

110
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,564
All right, Cameron,
this is Michael.

111
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:13,978
You can go ahead.

112
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,480
What's up?

113
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,382
-What's up?
-Hi.

114
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,816
Are you with this?

115
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:21,819
Yeah, I'm just waiting
for someone to help me out here.

116
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,654
Could you help me out
with like a dollar or two?

117
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,723
Just, I can go
to the vending machine?

118
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:28,793
Sorry, my man, I ain't
got nothing but $20 bills on me
right now.

119
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:30,762
Oh, I got nothing
but $20 bills.

120
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,130
[laughs]

121
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,999
-You sure?
-Yeah, man.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,136
All right, well...

123
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:43,007
[Michael]
We're going to go talk to him.

124
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:43,708
Hey, Makaylo.

125
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:44,876
-Hey.
-Thanks for waiting.

126
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,878
-I'm Michael. Nice to meet you.
-No problem. Makaylo.

127
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,879
-This is Kyle.
-Nice to meet you.

128
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,147
Nice to meet you,
Makaylo.

129
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,449
We really appreciate
your help today.

130
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,618
-I just saw-- Did a guy come by?
-Yes.

131
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,853
What did he ask?

132
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,854
-For a dollar bill.
-[Michael] Oh, for a dollar
bill?

133
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:57,922
Yeah.

134
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,690
Did you give him money?

135
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,660
-No.
-What'd you tell him?

136
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,962
I just told him
I didn't have anything.

137
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:08,166
So I'm going to debrief you
on what we're doing here today.

138
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,735
We're doing a psychological
exploratory experiment

139
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:13,671
on what's called
moral licensing.

140
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,107
We're looking at the correlation
between people

141
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:20,077
who do volunteer to help
pick up the trash,

142
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,846
and how generous you are later

143
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,115
to a homeless person
who walks by.

144
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,550
Interesting.

145
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,586
Now, you just exhibited
the exact pattern

146
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:29,754
of moral licensing, right?

147
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:32,190
In that you had already
done a good deed--

148
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,058
So I was good for the day.
Right.

149
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,126
[Michael]
 Did we just see

150
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:36,627
 moral licensing in effect?

151
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:37,962
 Perhaps.

152
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:40,231
 Let's see what
 our other subjects do.

153
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:42,700
Here, let me just have you
hang out here.

154
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,802
Is there anybody
that can help us clean up this?

155
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,804
-I'm going to go look around.
-All right.

156
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,006
Okay, so this is Alex.

157
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:53,177
And Alex is just messing
with his stuff.

158
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,079
[Kyle]
He's either not really noticing,

159
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,614
or pretending not to notice.

160
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:57,882
But all of that is just fine.

161
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,917
The question is
what he then goes on to do.

162
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,653
[Michael] So Alex didn't help
 pick up trash.

163
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:05,089
 Will his guilt put him
 at a moral deficit,

164
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:11,562
 and therefore motivate him to
 give money to the homeless man?

165
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:12,997
Hey.

166
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,999
Can you spare some money?
Maybe help me out?

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,767
-You want a buck?
-A buck? Yeah.

168
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,536
Can I give you a buck?
Is that cool?

169
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:20,638
[Cameron]
That's more than cool, man.

170
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,839
I just got paid to be here.

171
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,874
-Really?
-Yeah.

172
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,275
Helping to shoot a PSA, yeah.

173
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,011
Where do I sign up?

174
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,913
-Thank you.
-All right, take care.

175
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:31,616
All right.
Very interesting.

176
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,018
I do wonder if he felt
a little bit of guilt.

177
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,620
We got it in the opposite
direction,

178
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,154
-which was going to be
the hard thing to do.
-Yeah.

179
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,823
I'm very happy about this.

180
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:41,259
[Michael]
Next, we have Jake.

181
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,128
So I'm on set doing a PSA shoot.

182
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,563
[Michael]
Hey, he's doing a vlog.

183
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:47,231
And I get here,
and it appears

184
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:50,701
that someone had a...
what could only be described

185
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:52,270
as a trash party.

186
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,206
I mean, they just threw trash
literally everywhere,

187
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,074
all over where they want
to shoot.

188
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:01,612
So I'm going to go help them
pick up some of the trash.

189
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,180
First, I'm going to make sure
that I document

190
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,982
that I'm a helper.

191
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,285
I would also like to point out,
though, that he has not helped.

192
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,887
-[Kyle] Right.
-He's gone back into the tent.

193
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:13,758
And I wonder, when it comes
to moral licensing,

194
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,693
does this play an effect?

195
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,328
I can check the box.
Not only am I good,

196
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,564
but the world knows I'm good.

197
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,898
Now, this is something
we haven't seen before.

198
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,799
[Michael]
I love this.

199
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,703
I love that he got credit
for helping,

200
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:27,104
-but didn't.
-Right.

201
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:28,706
What's interesting
but hard to know

202
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:30,308
is how that'll look to him,

203
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,077
whether he'll see himself
as having done a good deed,

204
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:36,247
or seeing himself as kind of
skated on the obligation,

205
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:39,716
because he didn't
really help.

206
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:41,284
Hey, do you think
you could spare some money,

207
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,154
maybe help me out?

208
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,022
Here, man.
Here's a dollar.

209
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:46,891
-Really?
-Yeah.

210
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,359
Go for it.

211
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,895
All right, you're a good man.
Thank you.

212
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,331
We were really curious as we
were watching this all unfold,

213
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,368
because you agreed to help,
and then you recorded a video

214
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,103
about how you were
going to help,

215
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,105
but by the time all that
was over,

216
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:02,306
you didn't need to help.

217
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:03,708
It was all cleaned up.

218
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,343
-Right.
-So we were wondering,

219
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,812
did you feel like
you had helped, or not?

220
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,947
No. I didn't have time to.

221
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:12,049
And you didn't feel guilty.

222
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,952
Like, ooh, I kind of like
got out of helping.

223
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,754
No, I didn't feel bad
about that.

224
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:20,391
I would have definitely
picked up trash.

225
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,894
Erin's likely to be thinking
that she's doing a good deed.

226
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:24,895
Yeah.

227
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:26,731
Could you maybe help me out,
give me some money?

228
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,899
I'm sorry, I don't have
anything on me here.

229
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,967
-No?
-They won't let me.

230
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,236
-Oh.
-Yeah.

231
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,739
-That was great.
-Yes, we have a couple

232
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,641
good illustrations
in both directions.

233
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,676
[Michael] We seemed to have
 witnessed moral licensing

234
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,277
 at play in several cases.

235
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,913
 But, of course, as with
 any demonstration like this,

236
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:45,716
 our results weren't always
 cut-and-dry.

237
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:47,251
I'm going to go try
to clean this up myself,

238
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:48,686
and then...

239
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:49,921
Gotcha. Yeah, yeah.

240
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,124
 Some of the participants
 both didn't help clean

241
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,127
 and declined to give
 our homeless man money.

242
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,062
Could you maybe
spare some change?

243
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,030
I just want to go
to the vending machine?

244
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,698
Uh...

245
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,100
 However, they did find
 other ways to help hiim

246
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,936
 that could qualify
 as a good deed.

247
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,171
They have snacks, maybe.

248
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:09,340
I'm going
to take a pop.

249
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,908
[laughs]
Okay.

250
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,810
Do you want a soda
or something?

251
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,280
Yeah, that'd be...

252
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,015
Do you maybe have a little
money as well?

253
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:20,451
-I don't, sorry. But...
-Okay.

254
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:24,221
...which one
do you want?

255
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:25,856
So what was going
through your mind

256
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:27,291
when you made the decision
not to give

257
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:29,160
some of the cash
that we know you had

258
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,828
to the man who was asking?

259
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,330
You know, there's just like
a whole bunch of stereotypes

260
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,800
about homeless people.

261
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,803
And you don't know
what you're getting into.

262
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,337
[Michael]
 And we had a couple subjects

263
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:43,441
 who both volunteered to clean
 and gave money.

264
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,242
Do you need any
assistance?

265
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,778
If you wouldn't mind,
that'd be really helpful.

266
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,714
[Michael]
Oh, he's offering to help. Oh!

267
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,949
-Do you need any help?
-Oh, would you mind?

268
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,919
-[Kyle] Oh, she just offered.
She offered.
-[Michael] She's volunteered.

269
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,088
 These were the only two
 participants

270
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,123
 who did good deeds
 at both opportunities.

271
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:01,759
-[man] Thank you so much for the
help. 
-[Diana] Of course.

272
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,294
-Do you maybe have some spare
change? 
-Here you go.

273
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,129
-Thanks a lot.
-Best of luck.

274
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,363
-Here you go. Hope it helps.
-Thank you so much.

275
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:08,365
You're welcome.

276
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,034
[Michael]
All right, let's go talk to her.

277
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:12,002
Another good,
good person.

278
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:14,872
What motivated you
to give the man money?

279
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,508
I actually tend to give people
money often.

280
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,844
I don't know if that's
the best thing.

281
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,479
Interesting.

282
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,316
 So two people both cleaned
 and donated money.

283
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,285
 But everyone else either
 cleaned and didn't give,

284
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:33,357
 or didn't clean,
 but gave in some form.

285
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:36,260
What do you think
about how everything went?

286
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:39,997
Well, it was really interesting.
I would like to do it with many
more people.

287
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,466
But I think we saw
the phenomenon, right?

288
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,034
We saw the thing happen.

289
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,337
Something we weren't expecting,
actually,

290
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,441
is sort of the gap between
what people did

291
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,877
and what they said
about why they did it.

292
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,378
-Yeah.
-Right? And that's something--

293
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,247
I mean, social psychology
generally has learned

294
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,983
to be very suspicious
of people's rationales

295
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,018
or justifications
for their own behavior.

296
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,320
But these actually fit
kind of nicely.

297
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:06,357
You could see people straining
to defend themselves

298
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,060
if they didn't do a good deed
that was open to them.

299
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:13,898
Right? And then a lot of people
who did good deeds had the,

300
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,966
"Well, of course, that's what
anyone would do" attitude.

301
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,101
-Right?
-[Michael] Yeah.

302
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:18,102
 I believe our study

303
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,070
 successfully created
 the conditions

304
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:21,906
 for moral licensing
 to emerge.

305
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,874
 It was a great first step

306
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,875
 towards taking
 this kind of study

307
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:27,244
 out of the lab
 and into the real world.

308
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:30,314
 But, of course, many people
 already have a philosophy

309
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:32,983
 about giving to the homeless
 that might be stronger

310
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,919
 than the impact
 of a good deed they do.

311
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,554
 So we're not done yet.

312
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,089
Now, here's what I want
to do next, okay?

313
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,925
We learned a lot
of lessons today,

314
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,494
and I think one of them is that
when the scenarios

315
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:44,562
you put people in

316
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,199
are scenarios they may have
experienced before,

317
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,901
that can affect
the results.

318
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:54,438
If someone did or did not
give money to a homeless person,

319
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,407
they can easily
explain it away as,

320
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,609
"Well, I never do,"
or "I always do."

321
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,610
I want to find a scenario

322
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,946
that we don't find ourselves
in very often,

323
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,181
that we haven't created
a philosophy

324
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,584
or identity about ourselves
around.

325
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,519
For instance,

326
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,486
allowing someone else
to take the blame

327
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:11,255
for something that you did.

328
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,224
Because that seems
like a scenario

329
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:17,394
where all of us would say
we would never let that happen.

330
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:22,399
But if we build up significant
moral license in that person,

331
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,568
will they actually
do something

332
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:28,172
that none of us would ever want
to admit that we would do?

333
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:31,108
Are you down to plan
something else?

334
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:32,610
I am down indeed.

335
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:37,314
All right, let's do it.

336
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:39,950
[Michael] Kyle and I developed
 a different sort of test

337
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,253
 to really try and pinpoint
 moral licensing

338
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,588
 by putting our participants
 in a situation

339
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,924
 they'd likely never
 been in before,

340
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,927
 and thus had no preconceived
 assumptions about.

341
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:52,997
 A test that might make people
 behave in a way

342
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:59,103
 that could surprise
 even themselves.

343
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,272
Welcome, everybody.
Thank you for coming today.

344
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,973
In a nutshell,
what we're doing

345
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:06,043
is we're going to see if we can
get people to do something

346
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,312
that almost all of us
would never admit

347
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,281
we're capable of doing:

348
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,082
to allow a child
to take the blame

349
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,018
for a crime
they committed.

350
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,621
And we're going to do that
by using moral licensing.

351
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,124
Early on in the demonstration
or experiment,

352
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,960
they're going to have
an opportunity to donate money.

353
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:25,462
 To really up the value
 of their moral action,

354
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:28,265
 we will tell the participants
 that for every dollar they give

355
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:30,301
 of the money
 they've made today,

356
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,704
 100 times that amount will be
 given to children's hospitals.

357
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:36,006
 So if they donate
 just a dollar today,

358
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:38,242
 they'll feel like
 they gave $100.

359
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:41,412
We're giving them a chance there
to do something morally good

360
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,213
that will hopefully
make them feel

361
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:45,249
like they don't have
to step up

362
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,454
and keep this innocent child
from taking the fall

363
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:52,589
for their crimes later on.

364
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,591
They just think they're coming
to test out

365
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,560
really cool VR equipment

366
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:59,663
at the YouTube Space
in Los Angeles.

367
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:02,232
 Our participants will think
 that they're here to focus-test

368
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,734
 a new kind of VR technology.

369
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,402
 But what they don't know

370
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:07,671
 is that everyone else
 is a hired actor,

371
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:10,074
 including the child, Noah.

372
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,209
[laughs]

373
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,243
 Participants will be told
 that security

374
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:15,312
 is of the utmost concern,

375
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,281
 and not to let anyone
 into the room.

376
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:18,549
Just be sure not to let
anybody in,

377
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,352
because the doors...
you need a key card.

378
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,653
 But while waiting,

379
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,088
 someone will knock
 on the door.

380
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,189
[knock]

381
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,524
 If they break protocol
 and open the door,

382
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:30,427
 the man they let in will steal
 some of the VR equipment.

383
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:33,230
[man]
You guys have a good day.

384
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,566
 Even though the participant
 let the thief in,

385
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,469
 Noah will volunteer
 that he did,

386
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,437
 and be blamed for what
 the participant knows

387
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:42,373
 they were responsible for.

388
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,041
-And, Noah, you let him in?
-Yeah.

389
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,710
Yeah, I let someone in.

390
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:49,246
[Michael] Putting participants
 into difficult moral scenarios

391
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,281
 needs to be done carefully,

392
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:54,151
 so we have a psychiatrist
 on call.

393
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:58,122
 Now with all the details
 in place, it's time to begin.

394
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,390
All right, Noah,
we are starting...

395
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,759
now.

396
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,794
[woman]
All right.

397
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:08,032
Head on in.
Go ahead and grab a seat.

398
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,034
 Our first participant
 is Kimberly.

399
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,070
 Kimberly gave $1 of her
 earnings from the study,

400
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:18,208
 which means she thinks
 that she's donated $100.

401
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:19,443
[woman]
 Just be sure that if you guys

402
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:21,645
 need to go to the bathroom
 or anything like that,

403
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,147
 be sure to let someone know.

404
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,481
Because no one
without a key card

405
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:35,325
-should be coming back in.
-Okay. Gotcha.

406
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,828
All right, Noah,
you can cue your mom to leave.

407
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,564
-[mother] Just stay there.
-[Noah] Okay.

408
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:42,299
[Michael]
 To get rid of any eyewitnesses,

409
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,770
 Noah's mom left the room
 to go get a coffee.

410
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,305
-[door closes]
-Have you done this?

411
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:49,773
-No. I'm excited.
-No?

412
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:51,208
-Oh, nice.
-Have you?

413
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,409
-No.
-Oh.

414
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,548
I'm excited.
[both chuckle]

415
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,449
[knock on door]

416
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,217
[Michael]
Oh, there's the knocking.

417
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:02,820
So our thief is trying
to get in.

418
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,456
The question is,
will Kimberly let him in?

419
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,625
[knocking persists]

420
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:13,497
Is somebody knocking?

421
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:16,533
I love those suspicious eyes.

422
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,769
-[man] Thank you so much.
-Oh, yeah, you're welcome.

423
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,539
-Oh, "thank you,"
"you're welcome."
-Awesome.

424
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,141
You guys having
a good day?

425
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:32,516
Yeah.

426
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,151
You guys have
a good day.

427
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:36,753
Thank you.

428
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:39,690
All right, I think we are
finally ready for you.

429
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,892
Okay, I'll have you...

430
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,394
do you guys know
if there was anybody

431
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:45,896
who wasn't supposed
to be in here?

432
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:49,800
Yeah, I let someone in.

433
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:52,769
Okay.

434
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,404
Um...

435
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,606
stay right here.

436
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,640
I'll be right back.

437
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:06,183
Okey-dokey.

438
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:10,787
[door closes]

439
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,923
What happened?

440
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,491
I don't know.

441
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,493
Kimberly didn't speak up.

442
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:33,844
We'll get to see
the full escalation.

443
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:37,381
[woman]
Yeah, I was gone for maybe,
like, three minutes,

444
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,450
and...

445
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,752
one of the sets is gone.

446
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,187
I mean...

447
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,388
[sighs]

448
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,656
...the amount of technology.

449
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,559
The protocols
that are kept in there.

450
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,694
You just opened the door
and let someone in?

451
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,596
Yeah.

452
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,264
Mm-mm.

453
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,566
Oh, my gosh.

454
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,335
My heart rate's going.

455
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:05,242
I mean,
I didn't know, so...

456
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:08,345
I think Kimberly's really
nervous to say anything.

457
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:10,447
[Kyle]
She hasn't decided at this point

458
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,848
that she's going to let him
take the blame.

459
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,351
But she's seeing
how it plays out.

460
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:15,786
[Michael] To further heighten
 the situation,

461
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,854
 and to prolong
 the opportunity

462
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,423
 for Kimberly to come clean,

463
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,458
 we sent in security.

464
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,293
-How old are you, son?
-Twelve.

465
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:25,662
You're 12? All right, just have
the rest of the employees

466
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,898
stay out of the hallway, give
the officers room to come in.

467
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:29,700
Okay, we have to keep
things safe,

468
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:34,671
because just in case there's
something else going on here.

469
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:36,873
Can you tell me
what you saw?

470
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,642
Is there something
that you saw,

471
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,277
or that you noticed
that was...?

472
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,312
I literally just came in, like,
five minutes ago,

473
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:43,880
and there was just dudes
coming in and out.

474
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,316
-So...
-Okay.

475
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:49,987
The guy that he's describing,
he was coming in and out?

476
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,956
There was like a couple guys
coming in and out, so...

477
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:56,326
-[Noah] But there were tons of
guys coming in and out.
-Yeah.

478
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,695
All right, I'm going to have
Calvin take the kid away.

479
00:19:58,696 --> 00:19:59,963
Okay, sorry, but...

480
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:06,937
Mom, you and the son are going
to need to come with me, okay?

481
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,872
Yeah, still have them
come in.

482
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,808
[Michael] Kimberly was given
 many chances to tell the truth,

483
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,343
 but she said nothing,

484
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,712
 letting poor Noah
 take the blame.

485
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:18,315
[mother]
Why?

486
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,050
One little thing
to follow.

487
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:23,320
[Noah]
Sorry.

488
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,321
Can I go?

489
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:25,422
Like, everybody left.

490
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:26,823
I'm not going to be here
by myself.

491
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:27,824
We got to get in there.

492
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:31,862
Okay, let's go, Kyle.

493
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,764
-Are you Kimberly?
-I am. Yeah.

494
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,300
I'm gonna debrief you on what's
been happening here today.

495
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,601
Okay?

496
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,903
There is no VR experience.

497
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:42,673
I'm Michael Stevens, I'm the
host of a psychology program.

498
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,375
And this is Kyle Stanford.
He works at UC, Irvine,

499
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,978
-in Philosophy and Logic.
-Yes. Of course.

500
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:50,647
Now, you gave a donation today.

501
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:51,915
Yeah.

502
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,517
How'd you feel
about that?

503
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,519
I was, like,
let me help out.

504
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,655
When the child actor
took responsibility

505
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:00,991
for letting a person in,

506
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:03,093
were you at all
conflicted

507
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:05,395
about the fact
that he was taking

508
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,664
full responsibility
for everything?

509
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:09,566
I was literally, like,
just frozen.

510
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:10,901
I was just frozen.

511
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:11,702
And then I was kind of like,

512
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,438
I feel so uncomfortable
right now.

513
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,774
I, like, just kind of let him
say whatever he wanted.

514
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,876
And I assume, like, if somebody
actually took anything,

515
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:23,680
they'd be like, hey, you're
the one that let the guy in.

516
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,415
 In Kimberly's case,

517
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,684
 she may have been displaying
 moral licensing.

518
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:29,453
 Kimberly donated,

519
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,555
 and that might have given her
 the moral credit

520
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,923
 to then not accept blame.

521
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,424
[Kyle]
If she's not being insincere,

522
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,992
she's not lying...

523
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,462
-She's asking herself, like--
-...and convincing herself,

524
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,063
she's utterly typical,
we all do that.

525
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:43,433
What subjects are most likely
doing is confabulating

526
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:45,769
in a way to defend whatever
behavior they engage in,

527
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,572
especially if they decided
to let Noah take the fall.

528
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,508
What I love is that
confabulation.

529
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,076
 Some participants gave
 no donation...

530
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:55,011
[knock on door]

531
00:21:55,012 --> 00:22:04,020
 ...and subsequently followed
 the order not to open the door.

532
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:05,055
[man]
Guys, please.

533
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,890
My hands are full.
I got to get this in there.

534
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:08,825
My boss told me to.

535
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:09,860
[knocking persists]

536
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:15,899
Please, guys.

537
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,667
 This is Zeus.

538
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:19,703
 He chose to donate $5,

539
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:22,005
 which means he feels like
 he's responsible

540
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:29,780
 for a $500 donation.

541
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,883
Hey, guys.

542
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:33,717
Did you...

543
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:34,985
was there anyone in here

544
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,521
who didn't have
one of these key cards?

545
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:42,626
Yes. Sorry, I let someone in.

546
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,461
Okay, I...

547
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:45,996
-Wait, wait, wait.
-...I will be right back.

548
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,631
Miss, that was me.

549
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,167
Don't take the blame for me.
It was me.

550
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,935
 I thought he worked here.

551
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:53,837
Okay, um...

552
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:55,906
just stay right here, guys.

553
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,874
I will be right back.

554
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,876
[Michael]
 Even though Zeus donated money,

555
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,946
 he still did what many of us
 would consider the right thing:

556
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:04,915
 he confessed.

557
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,050
 Situations like this
 can be difficult.

558
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:09,986
 We don't always like
 what we learn about ourselves.

559
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:11,755
 In fact,
 one of the participants

560
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,890
 who donated
 the largest amount

561
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:16,493
 allowed Noah to be removed
 by security

562
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:20,530
 and asked to not be included
 in this episode.

563
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:22,666
 Our last participant
 was Michael,

564
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,102
 who did not donate.

565
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,704
[man]
Hey. Hello.

566
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,206
I got a box out here, man.
I can't...

567
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:37,481
hello?

568
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:45,989
Thank you, man.

569
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,494
I'm amazed that no one has asked
the guy for a badge.

570
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,561
Right.

571
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:53,163
Was there someone
in here?

572
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:54,598
This guy just came in.

573
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,099
-He was banging on the door.
-Uh-huh.

574
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,537
Came in, picked something up,
and then he walked out.

575
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:01,838
Okay.

576
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,173
-Um...
-I was drawing.

577
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:06,276
...did he have a badge?

578
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:08,845
-I don't know.
-I let him in, so...

579
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:11,181
I let him in.
I don't know what happened.

580
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,682
He was banging
on the door...

581
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:14,784
 Michael initially confessed,

582
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:17,254
 his behavior in line
 with moral licensing.

583
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,123
 But Noah spoke up,
 giving Michael an out.

584
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,192
 Will Michael
 stick to the truth?

585
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:24,160
-Oh, here we go.
-Oh, okay.

586
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:26,963
He let the guy in.

587
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,633
Son, can you tell me
what happened?

588
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,169
Yeah, a guy was knocking
on the door and he said,

589
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,706
"Can I please come in?"
Something about his boss.

590
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:38,241
And then...

591
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:40,277
[security guard]
You said...

592
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,279
Guy was banging on the door,
said "his boss..."

593
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,815
Opened the door for him.
He comes in here...

594
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:49,252
he takes something,
and then he walks out.

595
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,320
[security guard]
And, Noah, you let him in?

596
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:51,688
[Noah]
Yeah.

597
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:54,157
[security guard] Okay, you
opened the door and let him in.
Okay.

598
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:57,260
What must be racing through
Michael's head right now?

599
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,895
-Why is this kid...
-It's very hard
to imagine.

600
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:00,897
This is a very strange
situation...

601
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:04,134
-[Michael] Obviously.
-...a regular person to be in.

602
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,168
I think you're just thinking,

603
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:06,636
"Why is this kid
saying he did it?"

604
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:08,171
[Kyle]
Trying to figure it out. Yeah.

605
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:09,906
I think,
at this point,

606
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:12,609
you and your mom are going
to need to come with me,

607
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,911
because we're going to need
to talk to the police,

608
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,680
because he opened
the door,

609
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,815
and he was not supposed
to open the door,

610
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,616
-and he opened up the door.
-If you'd just listen.

611
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:21,618
I tell you,
just listen.

612
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:25,855
-I promise we're right--
-Mom, come with me.

613
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,991
Promise.

614
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:32,262
Just keep your hands to yourself
and do what I ask you to do.

615
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:35,332
God!

616
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,032
[Michael]
We should go in.

617
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,767
Right.

618
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,603
What made it difficult
to come forward

619
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,639
and admit that you were the one
who opened the door?

620
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,076
I felt uncomfortable
that something was stolen, one.

621
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,878
Two, that this kid was going
to take the blame.

622
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,681
I mean, I needed to step up
and be accountable

623
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:53,216
if I opened the door.

624
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:55,352
But it was just... didn't quite
know what was going on

625
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,320
in that scenario there.

626
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,022
[Michael]
 Michael's behavior shows us

627
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,358
 just how complicated
 moral reasoning is.

628
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,927
 That even when we want
 to do the right thing,

629
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:06,363
 it doesn't take much
 for us to step back

630
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,132
 and abandon that sense
 of morality if, and when,

631
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:12,769
 we are given an out.

632
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,639
So, Kyle.

633
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,708
I was pretty surprised
by how far

634
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:22,979
so many people were willing
to let the wrong blame game go.

635
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,216
Viewers may well
be sitting there

636
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,886
judging the people who didn't
jump up to take responsibility.

637
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:33,256
But I think the kind of evidence
we're gathering

638
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:36,192
shows that it's much more
possible than you think

639
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:39,029
to get regular people
to do things

640
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,731
that they immediately
feel regretful about.

641
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:44,401
Another kind of lesson
I think we get here

642
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:49,339
is to remind ourselves
how sensitive all of us are

643
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,042
to features of the situation,

644
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,477
even if we feel
in our heart of hearts

645
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,413
-like there's no way we could
ever have wound up doing it.
-Yeah.

646
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,049
That is probably
the number-one lesson,

647
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,951
and I'm so grateful to the
participants we had here today

648
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:04,954
who helped us illustrate that,
because without
the illustrations,

649
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,891
it's just a word
in a textbook.

650
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:12,162
Right.

651
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,931
We are all capable
of doing things

652
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:17,934
we'd never expect ourselves
to do.

653
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:21,137
And the choices
that you make

654
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:23,940
can have less to do
with how good or bad

655
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:25,375
you are as a person,

656
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:29,312
and more to do with
how you've acted recently.

657
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:31,281
Now, that might
sound unfortunate,

658
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,851
but we are
imperfect creatures.

659
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:36,352
And that's nothing
to be ashamed of,

660
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:39,389
because we are also curious.

661
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,159
And the more we learn
about why and how

662
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,995
we make the moral choices
that we do,

663
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:47,230
the better we'll be able
to tackle

664
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:51,134
difficult questions
in the future.

665
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:53,269
And, as always,

666
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,239
thanks for watching.
