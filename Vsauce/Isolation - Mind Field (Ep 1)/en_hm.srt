1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,808
Imagine being confined

2
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:12,211
to a 10-by-10-foot room
in complete isolation.

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,515
No timekeeping devices,
no phones, no books,

4
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:22,912
nothing to write on,
no windows.

5
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:25,358
Psychologists say that fewer
than three days

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,695
in a room like this
can lead to brain damage.

7
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,632
I will be staying in this room

8
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:36,256
for three days.

9
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:53,236
Clearly, he is on the border
of misery.

10
00:00:53,237 --> 00:00:55,889
Even in a city
surrounded by people,

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,892
it's possible to feel lonely

12
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,384
or bored.

13
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:04,229
Your brain
is like a hungry sponge.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,973
It's constantly absorbing
information.

15
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:08,735
It thrives when stimulated.

16
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,403
Between smartphones and books,

17
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,238
and movies,
and friends and family,

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,740
thousands of sensations

19
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,230
are constantly going
into our heads.

20
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:23,316
But what if it all
got cut off?

21
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,621
What is boredom?

22
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:26,703
Well, it's believed to be
an emotion

23
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:30,473
that's a less intense form
of disgust.

24
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:32,599
A visual representation
of emotions

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,433
developed by Robert Plutchik

26
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,770
shows them all on a wheel.

27
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:39,438
Notice that boredom
shares a spoke

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,768
with disgust and loathing.

29
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:45,358
They are different intensities
of the same emotion.

30
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,745
You see, boredom pushes us away
from low-stimulus situations

31
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:52,294
because variety and stimulation

32
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:54,841
literally lead
to neurogenesis –

33
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:56,749
brain-cell growth.

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,265
We are here today
doing what we do

35
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,220
because boredom has guided us

36
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,594
toward greater
and greater challenges

37
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:07,203
and bigger
and more complex brains.

38
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:10,581
So what is it like
to be deprived

39
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:13,817
of the sensations
and social interactions

40
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:19,640
so many of us take for granted?

41
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,010
A landmark study at Harvard

42
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:23,386
and Virginia Universities

43
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,036
found that students prefer

44
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:27,303
to experience physical pain

45
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:29,455
over 15 minutes of boredom.

46
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:31,364
To demonstrate
the surprising lengths

47
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:33,863
people will go to
to avoid boredom,

48
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:36,074
we brought in
an unsuspecting subject

49
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,501
for what he believes to be
a focus group.

50
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:41,697
We begin by introducing
a set of stimuli,

51
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:46,633
one of which
is very unpleasant.

52
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:50,110
What?

53
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:54,306
Touch it.

54
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,609
It did shock me.

55
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,710
Did it really?

56
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,245
He doesn't like it.

57
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,682
Our fake focus test
continues.

58
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,950
So let's start
with the shock button.

59
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,400
Jamison, would you choose

60
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:06,787
to experience this again?

61
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:08,777
I don't want
to do that again.

62
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:09,933
Why wouldn't you?

63
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,287
'Cause it shocked me, and

64
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:14,460
I can still feel it
going down my forearm.

65
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,433
Now it's time
for Jamison's true test.

66
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:18,935
The test of boredom.

67
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:21,237
You will be in the room
for 30 minutes.

68
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:22,883
Please remain in your chair.

69
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:24,153
Feel free to re-experience

70
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:25,487
the electric-shock button...

71
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:26,813
- Okay. Okay.
- Or not.

72
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:31,343
All right,
the moment of truth.

73
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,133
When the only two options

74
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:34,848
are boredom or painful shock,

75
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,985
which will
our subject choose?

76
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:46,251
He's not even looking
at the button.

77
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:48,073
It hasn't even been
a minute yet,

78
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:53,667
and already Jamison
is restless.

79
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:56,318
With a half hour to go

80
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,760
and no other stimulation
in the room,

81
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:00,811
the shock button
is a tempting object

82
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:07,379
to occupy Jamison's mind.

83
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,986
Remember what Jamison said
a few minutes ago.

84
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:13,162
I don't want
to do that again.

85
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:16,826
But will he desire 
stimulation so strongly,

86
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:34,541
he just goes ahead
and pushes that button?

87
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,494
It took exactly one minute

88
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:38,764
and 57 seconds of boredom

89
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:42,453
for Jamison's mind to go
from, "Never again,"

90
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:45,522
to "Sure, I'll give myself
an electric shock

91
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:47,517
to relieve boredom."

92
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:50,547
Sometimes stimulation,
any stimulation

93
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:53,716
is perceived
as better than none at all.

94
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:55,569
This guy doesn't like
being bored.

95
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:18,518
But can he resist touching it
a second time?

96
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,422
We're social animals.

97
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:21,782
Whether it's another human

98
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:24,498
or a volleyball
or an electric-shock button,

99
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:29,629
you'll make friends
with whatever you need to.

100
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,715
Jamison? I'm Michael.

101
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:33,136
Thanks for coming in today.

102
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:34,265
So tell me a little bit

103
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,605
about what you've been up to

104
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:36,570
here in this room.

105
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,728
I've been sitting
in this room with a button.

106
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:39,839
Yeah.

107
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,461
And despite saying
I didn't want to

108
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,223
press it again,
I pressed it twice.

109
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:44,781
Why?

110
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:47,531
I was just bored
in this room, I suppose, so...

111
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,493
Really?

112
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:51,645
- Did that hurt?
- Yes

113
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:54,525
The hypothesis
is that when left alone

114
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:56,189
with a very negative stimulus,

115
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,162
people will go ahead
an re-experience it

116
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:02,128
just because
it's something to do.

117
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:11,037
I'm one of them.

118
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,020
We dislike being bored so much,

119
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:18,879
sometimes physical pain
is preferable.

120
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,541
But intentionally 
putting yourself

121
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,553
into what would seem to be

122
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:26,867
the most boring 
environment possible

123
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,588
can be useful.

124
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:33,727
It's called
sensory deprivation.

125
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,989
Psychologists
have conducted experiments

126
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,468
on sensory deprivation
since the 1930s.

127
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:40,714
During the Cold War,

128
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,532
the military used
sensory deprivation

129
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,568
for both training
and interrogation.

130
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,079
In the 1970s, the activity
became recreational,

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,935
with soundproof,
lightproof flotation tanks

132
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:54,127
that keep you buoyant
with salt water

133
00:06:54,128 --> 00:07:01,254
that is the same temperature
as your body.

134
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,466
All right, so I'm on my way to

135
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,926
a subterranean float lab.

136
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,751
This company
sells sensory deprivation.

137
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,600
This will be
sort of a training session

138
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,265
for my three days in isolation,

139
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,895
and I'm getting guidance
from an expert.

140
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,269
Hey, Dominic.
How are you?

141
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,741
Hey.
What's up, Michael?

142
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,236
You know Dominic Monaghan

143
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,636
from "Lord of the Rings"

144
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:22,092
and the TV series "Lost."

145
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,794
Now, this is
your first time, right?

146
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:25,285
This is my first time.

147
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:26,496
I'm a little nervous.

148
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:28,842
I've never been alone
without any stimulation.

149
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:31,017
One of my favourite things
about floating is,

150
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,566
there's nothing else
going on.

151
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,007
- Ok.
- You can't see anything.

152
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:35,922
You can't hear anything.
You can't do anything.

153
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,688
You just have
to look at you.

154
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,743
And for some people,
that's scary. It's like

155
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,651
- looking in a mirror for hours.
- Yeah

156
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,666
This flotation tank
is a really good way

157
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:46,102
of getting him prepped
for the isolation chamber,

158
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:47,742
but I also think he needs to be

159
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:49,235
okay with the fact that

160
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,501
it's gonna put him outside
of his comfort zone.

161
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:52,901
The mind is a good thing

162
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:54,107
to lose every so often.

163
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:58,942
All right,
let's take a peek.

164
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,754
Oh. So this is the room.

165
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:03,332
This is where I will be floating
for the next hour,

166
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,725
alone with nothing to do

167
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:09,165
but listen to my thoughts.

168
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:14,294
I'll see you on the other side.

169
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:15,634
The mind is a good thing

170
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:16,997
to lose every so often.

171
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,679
You have to remind fear that

172
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,249
you're in the driver's seat.

173
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,903
- Hey!
- Dominic!

174
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,608
- How was it?
- It was really good.

175
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:26,879
- Yeah?
- Can we sit down?

176
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,001
Yeah, let's do it.

177
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:30,777
My initial thought when
I laid down was,

178
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,052
"Wow, this is buoyant."

179
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,221
And then I just...

180
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:40,024
started thinking 
about errands and tasks,

181
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,922
but at some point...

182
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,218
well, it was like dreams.

183
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:45,982
Uh-huh.

184
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,053
But my eyes were open.

185
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,303
Like, it was sort of like

186
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:49,295
half-dreams you have

187
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,177
either when you're 
about to fall asleep

188
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:52,368
or when you're waking up.

189
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:53,927
That's when it gets
interesting.

190
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:56,132
You're allowing your brain
to be free.

191
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:57,744
You're just floating
in space.

192
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,069
You're just atoms that are

193
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,182
on the top of this pool

194
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:01,101
floating in space.

195
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:02,645
So now you've done this,

196
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,844
and you're doing
this isolation booth.

197
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,377
Do you think that that
was in some way helpful

198
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:09,976
or a hindrance?

199
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:13,019
It made me more...

200
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,022
unhappy
about what's coming up.

201
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:28,301
Three days is quite a bit
different than one hour.

202
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,740
Some people choose isolation

203
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,273
to learn about isolation.

204
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,902
As we prepare
to explore other planets,

205
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:38,251
we're faced
with a little issue.

206
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:41,751
Stuff in outer space
is really,

207
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:43,386
really far apart.

208
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:45,088
Within our own solar system,

209
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,258
even a trip to Mars
would take months

210
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,220
in each direction.

211
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:52,120
That's a long time to spend

212
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,960
cut off from the rest of humanity

213
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,865
stuck in a tiny spaceship.

214
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:57,705
To get ready for those journeys

215
00:09:57,706 --> 00:09:59,799
we have subjected some people

216
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,136
to extreme conditions
here on Earth.

217
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:07,793
In 1989, a young Italian
interior designer

218
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:09,589
named Stefania Follini

219
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,848
volunteered
for a NASA experiment

220
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:14,154
to help study the effects
of isolation

221
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,046
associated with space travel.

222
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:20,827
She spent 130 days alone

223
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,792
in a plexiglass cell

224
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:26,943
in a cave 30 feet underground
in New Mexico.

225
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:28,497
In the absence of timepieces

226
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:31,097
and any sign of day or night,

227
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,733
Ms Follini's body
was thrown out of whack.

228
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,765
Her menstrual cycle stopped,

229
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:39,179
and her sleep-wake cycle
changed radically.

230
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,616
She tended to stay awake

231
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:43,176
for 20 to 25 hours at a time

232
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,852
sleeping about 10 hours.

233
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,243
When she finally emerged,

234
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:48,898
she mistakenly believed

235
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,088
she'd only been underground
about half as long

236
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,847
as she actually had.

237
00:10:53,848 --> 00:10:56,940
As difficult
as Stefania's experience was,

238
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:58,995
at least she had books
to read.

239
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:00,997
In my isolation chamber,

240
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:11,330
I will only have white walls
to stare at.

241
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:13,749
Alone time –
what a pleasure.

242
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,042
Checking out,
getting away from it all,

243
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,762
relaxing...

244
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:21,241
Banishment from society,

245
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:23,263
the silent treatment,

246
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:28,388
solitary confinement.

247
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:34,528
Solitude isn't always nice.

248
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,920
What happens when isolation

249
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:39,766
is not voluntary?

250
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,065
William Brown
has firsthand knowledge

251
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,237
of solitary confinement.

252
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,043
So, William,
how much of your life

253
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:49,135
have you spent in prison?

254
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:51,918
Probably, like, 16 years.

255
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,294
That's, like,
almost half your life.

256
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,812
Yeah, basically,
almost half my life,

257
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:58,522
'cause I went to jail
when I was 18

258
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:00,787
for armed bank robbery.

259
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:04,087
This right here...

260
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:09,429
This was my home, off and on,
about two years.

261
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,438
The hole.

262
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,838
What was the longest stretch

263
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,175
of consecutive time?

264
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:19,065
It was, like,
five months total.

265
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,900
I'll tell you
what really amazes me.

266
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:24,944
This feels so much worse
than a jail cell.

267
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,444
This doesn't have bars

268
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,114
letting in light or a view.

269
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,319
Not at all.

270
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,284
Would you have
a mattress at least?

271
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:32,679
That would be the only thing.

272
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,089
In this particular cell, that

273
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,645
would be the only thing in here.

274
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,327
You would just have a mattress, and

275
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:39,459
other than that
you would have nothing more.

276
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,595
This light
will constantly stay on,

277
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,604
so there will be, you know...

278
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:45,541
That light's always on?

279
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:47,497
Even at night?

280
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:49,483
That light is always on.

281
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:52,442
You're left in here
with your thoughts,

282
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:57,076
and that's it.

283
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,685
I would sit

284
00:12:58,686 --> 00:12:59,845
like, say, for example,

285
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,310
sit in this corner right here.

286
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,102
Like, facing the corner
or facing out?

287
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,130
No, I would face out,

288
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:05,985
and I would just sit

289
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,592
and just concentrate
on breathing.

290
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:11,558
You don't know.
It's like you're in limbo.

291
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,778
You never know when

292
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,166
they're gonna open the door.

293
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,596
I've known guys that have served

294
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:17,631
consecutive years

295
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:20,481
inside this same
little box.

296
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:21,971
How does that change them?

297
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,538
Mentally,
it scars them for life.

298
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,966
- Really?
- Yeah.

299
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:29,139
This is what I'm gonna do.

300
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,489
I'm gonna put myself in a room

301
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,761
like one of these,

302
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,394
and I won't have a clock...

303
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:35,995
Anything at all.

304
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,253
No way to tell time.

305
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:39,155
What I'm nervous about is,

306
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:41,924
when that door closes...

307
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:43,627
...the awareness,
the sudden awareness

308
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,996
of how much time I have.

309
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:48,885
See, that's the thing
about it,

310
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:51,334
'cause once this door
right here closes,

311
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:53,973
it's, like, it's final.

312
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,506
This is almost a coffin.

313
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:59,540
Really?

314
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,700
Even more extreme than isolation

315
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,156
from other people

316
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:07,067
is isolation from other people
and stimuli.

317
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:08,883
That's what I'm going
to be doing

318
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:16,369
inside this room.

319
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,162
This is about as boring
as a room can get.

320
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:21,432
It's soundproof, and this light

321
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,062
will never turn off.

322
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,001
I do have a small bed,

323
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:27,177
but there will be
no interruptions.

324
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:29,209
I will have no way
to tell what time it is.

325
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,987
No meals will be delivered,

326
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:32,037
because all the meals

327
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,507
are inside the room already

328
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:36,212
white containers of Soylent.

329
00:14:36,213 --> 00:14:38,244
I do have plenty of water,

330
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,377
and I have a wash basin

331
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:41,715
with a white bar of soap,

332
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:46,078
and I've got myself
a tiny, little toilet.

333
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,088
There's nothing to do
but be completely alone

334
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,014
with myself and my thoughts.

335
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,693
Now, psychologists say

336
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:55,094
that fewer than three days
in a room like this

337
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,933
can lead to brain damage.

338
00:14:56,934 --> 00:15:00,947
I will be staying in this room
for three days

339
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:08,441
a full 72 hours.

340
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:12,613
So I'm going to take
your vitals first.

341
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:15,911
Michael is basically turning
himself into a lab rat.

342
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,771
What we want to to is see

343
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:19,485
what might change with Michael

344
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,480
before and after his time
in isolation

345
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:23,436
what's gonna happen
to his blood pressure,

346
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,006
what's gonna happen 
to his pulse

347
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,247
his basic reflexes.

348
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:28,577
Are there actually any medical

349
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:29,768
concerns you would have?

350
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,614
I'm just gonna be
in this room.

351
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,436
You got a really
bright light on there.

352
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:35,134
The circadian rhythm,

353
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,470
which is your natural
wake and sleep cycle

354
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,255
is going to be
completely disrupted

355
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:40,621
by this really bright light.

356
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:42,511
And once your
circadian rhythm gets off,

357
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:44,394
a lot of other things
fall apart.

358
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:46,262
Hormone cycles,
cognitive ability,

359
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,247
metabolic processes.

360
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,747
So, you know, it's kind of like

361
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,552
you're giving yourself jet lag.

362
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:52,686
Oh, great.

363
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,493
I think it's important to test

364
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:55,789
his cognitive ability

365
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,628
to gauge any mental decline

366
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:02,696
that might happen during 
his 72 hours of isolation.

367
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:05,465
Let's try the reaction time.

368
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,079
Okay, do...

369
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,438
This is pretty fun.

370
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:10,349
Can I bring this into the room
with me?

371
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,567
So what's gonna happen
to my brain in there?

372
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:16,242
Well, one of the issues
that might worry me

373
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,317
is how calm versus neurotic
you might be.

374
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:21,156
Where would you put yourself
on that spectrum?

375
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:23,429
Closer to neurotic. I mean...

376
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,731
Yeah.

377
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:26,783
And so I wonder
if that might be amplified.

378
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,228
That is how my brain
will work.

379
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:29,943
- Right. Of course.
- It'll snowball.

380
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,457
I'm scared.

381
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,867
I'm not gonna be able to deal

382
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,227
with the monotony

383
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:36,102
and the lack
of a sense of time,

384
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,811
and I'm gonna have
a panic attack.

385
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:39,315
In an extreme situation,

386
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:41,635
people can have
massive hallucinations,

387
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:43,504
be dissociated from reality,

388
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:47,470
have tremendous anxiety,
psychotic types of episodes.

389
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:49,643
Marnie, Jake...

390
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,645
I'm gonna be gone
for three days.

391
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:54,019
The danger signs to look out for

392
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,399
are extreme agitation,
where it doesn't appear

393
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,786
that he's aware 
of his own agitation.

394
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:03,896
That's when I think
I might intervene.

395
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,538
I'm not worried
for him physically.

396
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:07,870
Like, I think, you know,
he's safe in there.

397
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:10,540
But I think that he's gonna
struggle in there.

398
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,882
He's gonna be really bored.

399
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:14,400
- I love you.
- Love you too.

400
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:24,768
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

401
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,718
Oh, my God.

402
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:32,218
Bye.

403
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,326
Ah, forgot to ask what time it was

404
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:38,326
when I came in.

405
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,246
He's always 
doing something.

406
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,671
Reading something, 
talking to someone.

407
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:44,907
he already looks really bored 
and he's been

408
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:47,507
in there 5 seconds.

409
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:51,571
It's just gonna be
a horrible 72 hours.

410
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,146
I'm actually pretty tired.

411
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:55,339
I've been standing
a bunch today.

412
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,809
Normally, when I change

413
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,238
into more comfortable clothes

414
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,149
and I'm, like, ready for bed

415
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,047
I lay down,
and then I pick up my phone,

416
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,999
or I pick up a book
or something,

417
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,287
but I don't have that.

418
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,290
If he succeeds
in going to sleep

419
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:15,629
for any length of time
that's substantial,

420
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,153
it's gonna be
interesting to see

421
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:19,239
what time he thinks it is
when he wakes up.

422
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:34,504
Right.

423
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:36,272
I was able to sleep.

424
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:37,789
And I woke up

425
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,601
maybe one or two times
in the night.

426
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:44,260
So I think it's probably,

427
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:46,760
you know, 8:00 a.m.
Thursday morning,

428
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:48,795
maybe closer to 9:00 a.m.

429
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:54,300
I guess I should have
some breakfast.

430
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,836
One...

431
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:59,305
two...three...

432
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,374
I've known Michael
for three years,

433
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,510
and I've never seen him
do a push-up.

434
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:08,314
Six...

435
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,316
Z, Y, X, W, V,

436
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,786
U, T, S, R, Q,

437
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:14,621
P, O, N, M, L, K...

438
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:15,956
I think he's come up

439
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,792
with some good ideas
for mental stimulation.

440
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,194
I wonder if, as time goes by,

441
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:21,502
he's gonna come up

442
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:22,911
with some more creative ones,

443
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,690
or he's gonna start
to get less creative.

444
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,906
I've done 200 steps now

445
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:31,534
8 more hundreds to go,
and I'll be at 1,000.

446
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,747
Why is it that so many people
turn to counting

447
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:35,087
to stay sane when they're

448
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,483
in these isolated environments?

449
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:39,680
Well, our minds
want to remain active.

450
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,601
They're naturally active.

451
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:43,196
The healthiest people
who survive

452
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:44,726
in these types of environments

453
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,455
will do something
to self-stimulate.

454
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:47,795
They'll count. They'll sing.

455
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:49,202
They'll do physical exercise.

456
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:52,255
97, 98, 99, 100.

457
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:54,832
300 steps 
and then some change

458
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,362
that I just took right there.

459
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:04,771
That's just a little bonus
for my body, for my health.

460
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,178
It's amazing how hard it is

461
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,638
to tell what time of day it is

462
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,832
just based on your body.

463
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,376
I think it's...

464
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:14,968
about 7.00 or 7.30 p.m.
on Thursday.

465
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:17,383
I think I'm gonna have
dinner now.

466
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,587
He's already quite off
on his perception of time.

467
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:21,887
I was actually surprised

468
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,196
at how quick that happened.

469
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:24,297
I was, too.

470
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:25,612
You know, if you're using

471
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:26,569
hunger as your gauge

472
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,867
that's out the window, too,

473
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:29,255
because the shifts
in hormones

474
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:30,824
are going to change
your appetite.

475
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,566
You know,
they look at lab rats

476
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,676
who have had their
circadian rhythm destroyed,

477
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:36,703
and they overeat.

478
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,872
12, 13...

479
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:43,577
At the moment, I'm feeling...

480
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:48,414
...bored but obviously
nothing dramatic.

481
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,713
If I had to guess,

482
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:53,019
it would be...

483
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,623
24 hours now
since I first came in.

484
00:20:56,624 --> 00:21:00,009
One day down, two to go.

485
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,617
If he gets
a full sleep cycle in,

486
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:03,453
he'll wake up not knowing
where he is.

487
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:14,440
Right.

488
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:19,292
Good morning.

489
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:21,683
I don't know
if I slept for eight hours

490
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:23,449
or if I slept for three.

491
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,426
If you think
it's bedtime, it is...

492
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:27,767
so long as you go to bed.

493
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:29,589
If you think
it's breakfast time,

494
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,627
it is, if you're having
breakfast.

495
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:36,466
What am I looking 
forward to the most?

496
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,584
Uh...

497
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:42,468
seeing my family and friends.

498
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,938
It's not even
that I want a meal.

499
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:46,472
It's actually that I just want

500
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,440
to have a meal with people.

501
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,476
I just want to talk
to some people.

502
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,946
I just want some other words
coming in to me

503
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:55,949
than the ones that come
out of my own mouth.

504
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,484
He enjoys sharing things
with people,

505
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,824
and to have no one, just nothing

506
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,421
coming back for three days,

507
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:03,537
might be difficult.

508
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,471
I am the only person

509
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:07,426
I'm hanging out with.

510
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,789
If you're
in true isolation,

511
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,480
literally, part of your brain
is generating

512
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:11,690
some kind of companion

513
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:12,954
that you can converse with.

514
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:16,739
I think having you here...

515
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,972
makes a big difference.

516
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:20,807
He's entertained himself
in a sense,

517
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:22,308
you know, talking
to the camera,

518
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,823
and that's been helpful
for him.

519
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:26,439
It's really kept him
cognitively aware.

520
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,209
I just feel like I've really

521
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,116
lost all connection to time,

522
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:35,748
but I'm guessing
it's, you know, 8.00 p.m.

523
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:39,132
maybe 9.00 p.m. on Friday.

524
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:42,075
A good time
to get some shut-eye

525
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:49,846
when there's not
much else to do.

526
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:54,247
I think it's Saturday,
about 9.00 a.m.

527
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,017
Saturday, the day I get out.

528
00:22:57,018 --> 00:22:59,557
So his dissociation with
the actual time

529
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:01,517
has doubled now.

530
00:23:01,518 --> 00:23:03,953
Right. He wakes up, 
and there's this bright light,

531
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:06,021
and he's thinking,
"Oh, it must be morning."

532
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:08,588
I've spent a lot of time
being entertained

533
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:10,806
by my memories,

534
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,993
and I'm thinking of the people
and the places

535
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:15,915
and the events
and how I miss them

536
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,731
and how I treasure
those moments.

537
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:19,733
There's a sort of cinema
in my brain,

538
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:21,201
a cinema of those memories

539
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:25,038
that's kept me
from being very bored.

540
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,713
So I think...

541
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:30,450
it's 8.00 p.m.

542
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,858
on Saturday.

543
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:33,850
So, in about a couple hours,

544
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:37,633
I should see that door open.

545
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:38,888
He's not even close,

546
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:51,765
and I wonder how he's gonna
respond to that.

547
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:55,668
I don't think
I'm getting out today.

548
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,168
A fear I have right now

549
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,072
is that it's just Friday

550
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:01,074
and that there's still

551
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:05,130
a lot of time left.

552
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:06,932
There were other times
during this

553
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:11,520
that I was definitely more Zen
about everything.

554
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:18,341
Now I'm upset.

555
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:19,971
I can't believe the colour

556
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,028
of the light isn't changing.

557
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,955
In the mornings,
when I wake up,

558
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:27,634
it's so much more yellow.

559
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:29,636
Without some type
of stimulation,

560
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:31,331
the mind wants to stimulate
itself anyway

561
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:32,675
and will begin
to hallucinate

562
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:34,464
and begin
to play all sorts of tricks.

563
00:24:34,465 --> 00:24:35,976
Absolutely.

564
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:39,328
My thoughts
are really incoherent.

565
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:40,448
It's hard for me even

566
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:42,708
to remember what I just thought.

567
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,651
712, 713, 714,

568
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:48,822
715, 7...

569
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:51,658
15, 716, 717, 718 ...

570
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,893
In a way, our brains

571
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,196
are kind of
a "use it or lose it" thing.

572
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:58,611
He's going to have
a definite decrease

573
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:00,896
in his cognitive ability,

574
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:08,675
a decrease in his overall 
sense of well-being.

575
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:11,011
How many bottles of water
have I drank?

576
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:12,979
Is there one more...

577
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,617
laying around here
that I've lost?

578
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:20,687
'Cause there are only six here.

579
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:25,098
But then down here
there are...

580
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:35,702
Did I...

581
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,871
All of the dreams I've had
that I remember

582
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,656
have been about this room.

583
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,855
They've been
about me being in this room

584
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:49,936
and about...

585
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:51,747
He wakes up,
and then he's in the room,

586
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:52,973
and it's difficult for him

587
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:54,119
to discern the difference

588
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,685
between reality
and dreaming sometimes.

589
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:57,357
So that's a real dissociation
for him.

590
00:25:57,358 --> 00:26:00,360
S, R, Q...

591
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:02,962
L, M, N, O, P...

592
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:04,898
I actually feel
kind of worried about him now,

593
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:07,000
because when he first went
in there,

594
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,640
he was, like, bored like someone

595
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:09,903
waiting for a bus, you know.

596
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:14,040
Now he looks
actually depressed.

597
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,976
The soap is really unique.

598
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:19,965
It's not a kind of soap
I've ever used before,

599
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:22,682
and I really dislike the smell.

600
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:23,901
And I keep smelling it

601
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:28,291
'cause it's just sitting there.

602
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:31,537
Clearly, Michael
is not happy right now.

603
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:33,304
He looks, like, you know

604
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:41,514
on the border of misery.

605
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:45,821
Really aggravated
by how uncomfortable I am.

606
00:26:45,822 --> 00:27:00,396
This seems like a very,
very long three days.

607
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:03,626
I'd feel better 
if he was talking.

608
00:27:03,627 --> 00:27:04,791
He was just laying there.

609
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,793
When I walked in,
I thought he'd be,

610
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,408
you know, sitting on the bed.

611
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,266
You know, this was something

612
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:13,266
he wanted to do, but...

613
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:16,812
I expected him to be bored...

614
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:17,971
terribly bored,

615
00:27:17,972 --> 00:27:22,142
but I thought
he'd still be talking and...

616
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:35,381
trying to entertain himself.

617
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:38,342
It seems like Michael woke up

618
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:42,862
from some kind of dream.

619
00:27:42,863 --> 00:28:21,803
He looks confused.

620
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:35,151
He's not enjoying this. 
He wants out of there.

621
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:46,041
I don't think he can see us.

622
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,193
I'm really confused.

623
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:55,536
Wait.
Did...

624
00:28:55,537 --> 00:29:08,405
I guess not.
I guess I just dreamt it.

625
00:29:08,406 --> 00:29:14,387
I didn't think 
it would affect me like this.

626
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:18,436
I am so confused.

627
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:48,975
I think he just woke up 
and was having a dream.

628
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:51,592
Is 72 hours over?

629
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:54,133
It's 72 hours, Michael.
You can come out.

630
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:59,241
All right, I'm coming out.

631
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:00,166
Hey.

632
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:02,248
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

633
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:03,887
Oh, my gosh,
it's bright in there.

634
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:05,371
It's really bright in there.

635
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:06,681
I hadn't really noticed

636
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,207
but now that you mention it.

637
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,442
- Congratulations.
- Hey.

638
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:11,180
That knock scared me.

639
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:12,606
- Did it startle you?
- Yeah.

640
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:14,615
Every little noise
has been startling me.

641
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:17,053
Okay. You seem
very with it right now.

642
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:19,885
It's excited energy
by coming out.

643
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:21,095
At first, I thought it was

644
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:22,623
that I want to communicate,

645
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:26,359
but, actually,
I need this direction, too.

646
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,579
Even if it's just nods and stuff,

647
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,079
that's so much better.

648
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,549
Let me just check your vitals

649
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,934
before you see your family.

650
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:37,170
155 over 95,

651
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:42,117
so that's quite a jump
in your blood pressure.

652
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:43,386
Your pulse is also higher.

653
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:45,584
I think that's 'cause
you're excited to be out.

654
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:46,973
I think this is a huge rush.

655
00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:49,159
I'm interested to see now
how you do

656
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,151
with some 
of the more cognitive tests.

657
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:55,968
3-18-09-72-72?

658
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:57,056
There you go.

659
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:58,706
I would say you did actually

660
00:30:58,707 --> 00:30:59,959
a little bit better this time.

661
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,352
Oh, wow. Okay.

662
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:02,705
Although we had hypothesised

663
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:04,697
you would be worse at all of these tests,

664
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,039
I think the rush of adrenaline
that you got

665
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,606
from finally being out and being
to able to communicate

666
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:12,338
actually had you more focused,
more aware,

667
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,200
and that's why 
you performed better.

668
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,680
I find it interesting that

669
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:17,630
the test you did the worst on

670
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:20,501
is probably the most to do 
with the use

671
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:21,981
of the verbal language,

672
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,635
and you've had definitely a lack

673
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:26,185
of that over the last 72 hours.

674
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:29,956
It was just me with myself
for three days.

675
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,057
It was only me.

676
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,425
Hey. How are you?

677
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:35,596
- I'm good.
- Oh, good. I missed you.

678
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:37,668
Let me say hi to my mom.

679
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,049
Hi.

680
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,468
Oh. Glad you survived that.

681
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:45,118
In the room,
I was fine being alone.

682
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,707
This is where
I've been living.

683
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:48,575
But then near the end,

684
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:51,077
as I started to anticipate
coming out

685
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,677
and being able to talk to people

686
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,581
and share my experience

687
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,416
I realised
how important that was.

688
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,418
If you only have
your own experiences,

689
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,086
you're not fully having them.

690
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,255
You have to have someone else
to listen to them

691
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:03,806
and react to them,

692
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,759
and then you've
fully experienced them.

693
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:19,222
Anyway, I've moved.
I don't live there anymore.

694
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:20,607
When I was in isolation,

695
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:23,492
I was surprised most
by two things –

696
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:26,426
how easy it was to be separated
from distractions,

697
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:28,525
like entertainment and phones,

698
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:31,758
and how difficult it was
to be separated

699
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,121
from things we humans evolved
alongside –

700
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,254
the Earth and other people.

701
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:40,627
I was amazed
by how uncomfortable,

702
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:43,637
confusing, and scary it was

703
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:46,883
to have nothing but myself.

704
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:48,133
You know, I used to be

705
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,722
a really big fan of the saying,

706
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:52,789
"He who travels fastest
travels alone."

707
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,314
I think I liked it
because it made me feel better

708
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:57,209
about how I preferred
to be independent

709
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,495
and to be left
to my own devices.

710
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:02,488
But now I appreciate
the full phrase better.

711
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:07,300
It may be true that he who
travels fastest travels alone,

712
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:10,323
but he who travels furthest

713
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:14,160
travels with others.

714
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:20,667
And, as always,
thanks for watching.

715
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:26,607
This season on "Mind Field"...

716
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:29,075
Ready?

717
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:30,615
Hold the drug in your mouth

718
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:32,552
until we say "swallow."
