00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,119
Hey, Vsauce, Michael here

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,259
And here, I am the real Michael

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,179
This Michael was created by a brilliant young man named Mitchell,

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,319
who brought it to me at a meet-and-greet after Brain Candy Live

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,439
It is phenomenal and obviously the most handsome jack-in-the-box ever

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,959
Ever-est is a mountain that's 8.848 km tall

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,039
Its size is impressive

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,559
Or is it?

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,359
(Characteristic music of Vsauce, get prepared to be mind = blown)

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,739
Let's cut Earth, the entire planet, right in half,

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,759
straight through Everest, and then start zooming out

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:54,519
As you can see, Everest's monumentality quickly disappears against Earth's planetary ginormosity

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,399
Compared to Earth's diameter

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,339
Everest—in fact, all of Earth's ruggedness—barely registers

15
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,159
That can seem surprising, since we are often surrounded by diagrams and maps and globes

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,459
that exaggerate Earth's topography

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,019
There is a good reason to do that,

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,179
but it leads to a misconception about just how smooth Earth is

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,419
Here's a typical example:

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,459
a cross section of the United States that I found on reddit

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,879
The vertical axis spans about 10,000 ft,

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,799
but the horizontal axis represents nearly 14 million ft

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,559
Stretched to the same scale so as to mirror reality,

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
the actual smoothness of the Earth becomes apparent

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,799
On this 1 ft diameter globe,

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,319
Everest is a bump about 2 mm high

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,239
Feels good!

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,719
But if the Earth was actually this small,

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,399
Everest would be a bump only 0.2 mm high

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,599
It's 10 times taller than it should be

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,319
Only 24 people have seen the Earth, with their own eyes, as a circle small enough to be looked right at;

32
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,758
not as the whole world, but as a little thing suspended alone in space

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,699
The further away you are from a ball, the more of its surface you can see

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,019
We don't always notice this,

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,779
because in our day-to-day lives,

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,599
most of the balls we deal with are so small

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,499
they're almost always many of their own radii away from us,

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,059
and the available amount of their surface visible is near a maximum

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:34,879
Or, they're so big, like the Earth, that we rarely get far enough away fast enough to notice this property

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,399
But the next time you are near a ball, get close to it

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,499
You'll see that as you get nearer, more of its surface disappears behind the horizon,

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,819
but moving back up will make it available again

43
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,919
For most of us, stuck our whole lives on Earth's surface,

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,499
such an experience is impossible

45
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,879
WIth nothing around to block your view,

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,939
5 km (about 3 mi) is about the furthest you can see

47
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,239
Haze can limit your view and atmospheric refraction can slightly extend it,

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,959
but for the most part, everything you can see happens within an area of just 80 km^2

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,939
That's not bad, but it's tiny compared with what there is to see

50
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,259
The higher up you go, of course, the further away you will be able to see

51
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,239
That's why it's great to be a satellite

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,279
Here's the International Space Station

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,719
Yeah, look at that nice bit portion of the surface in view

54
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,759
Unfortunately, this isn't to scale

55
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,419
If the Earth were the size of an apple,

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,259
how far away would the International Space Station  orbit?

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,319
Like this far away?

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,759
Maybe this far away

59
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,859
Maybe this far away

60
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,399
Actually, it orbits… here,

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,739
2.7 mm above the surface

62
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,599
That's how far the stem of this apple sticks up

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,179
It's not very far

64
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,679
Oh, here's another fun little to scale fact:

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,699
if the Earth were the size of an apple, your eyeball would be about the size of the moon

66
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,439
We often imagine that from the International Space Station,

67
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,539
astronauts see the Earth like this, but they're just not that far away

68
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,619
From where they actually orbit,

69
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,778
International Space Station residents only see about 3% of Earth's surface at any one time

70
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,939
And that 3% is too wide to all fit within a window

71
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,699
When I was in Pittsburgh, their science museum had a mock-up of part of the ISS

72
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,139
And as you can see, out of the window, Earth is still quite expansive

73
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:39,419
Using special lenses, images can be taken from the ISS that look like circular disk Earths,

74
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,719
but the lens is distorting things here

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,299
It's fitting much more into the picture

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,499
In order to truly witness Earth's entire shape with your own eyes,

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,699
you would need to either smash your face right up against the window

78
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,679
or just be floating outside the station

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,439
And even then, you would have to move your head to see from edge to edge

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,219
So, how high up do you have to go to see the edges of Earth all at once?

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,159
And, even if you did that, how much would you actually see?

82
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,119
How much is there to see?

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,599
Earth is made of stuff,

84
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,399
lots of stuff: water and dirt and rocks and air, all of which are composed of atoms

85
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,979
tiny things so teeny that a single drop of water contains not a million atoms,

86
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:38,319
not a billion atoms, or a trillion, or a quadrillion, or a quintillion but 5 sextillion atoms

87
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,579
Earth is made of even more stuff:

88
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,699
not a septillion atoms, not an octillion, nonillion,

89
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,639
decillion, undecillion, duodecillion, tredecillion,

90
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:54,119
not even a quattuordecillion but 100 quindecillion atoms

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,799
But since we live only on the surface of our planet, we unfortunately can't see most of those atoms

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,879
If the Earth was shaped like a disk or an icosahedron,

93
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:17,119
or, say, a cube, or a rectangular prism, or two stellated rhombic dodecahedrons,

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,459
we could see more of the Earth than we normally can

95
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,259
But as things are, we actually see nearly the least of Earth's matter possible

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,879
because of all solids, a sphere, which the Earth approximately is,

97
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,219
has the smallest surface-area-to-volume ratio—the most stuff inside and the least stuff outside

98
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,539
So, how many of these 10^50 atoms that make up Earth are on the surface for us to see?

99
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,319
That's not an easy question

100
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,419
For one thing, technically, atoms on the surfaces of opaque things like rocks and dirt

101
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,819
aren't the only parts involved in their appearances

102
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,779
Sub-surface scattering can and does happen

103
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,099
Regardless, attempting even a rough approximation is illuminating

104
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,299
I asked Grant from the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown for some help

105
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,659
And he pointed out that if you calculate the number of circles with atom-sized radii

106
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:24,539
that could, packed optimally, cover a sphere with the surface area of Earth, you'll get about 1.5×10^34

107
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,479
That's a lot of atoms

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,179
But then he pointed out that the Earth's surface isn't smooth

109
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,499
Its roughness provides extra surface area for atoms to occupy

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,099
Without a complete description of the shape of Earth's surface—every mountain and valley,

111
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,699
every bump on every rock—this is just gonna be hopeless, right?

112
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:53,899
Well, here's the thing, Earth is made of little rugged shapes that from far away make big rugged shapes

113
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,479
In other words, Earth's surface can be described as a fractal

114
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,499
There is a regularity to its roughness

115
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:09,059
In fact, mathematicians have even assigned a fractal dimension to Earth's surface: 2.3

116
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,819
To see what that means, I highly recommend Grant's video on fractal dimensions

117
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,939
It's fascinating

118
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,839
Using 2.3 and assuming that it applies from the scale of a human hair up to that of a mountain,

119
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,839
Grant found that the number of atoms on Earth's surface changes significantly:

120
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,779
up from a power of 34 to a power of 37

121
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,178
That's 1000 times more atoms

122
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,079
So, maybe we shouldn't count Earth's roughness out just yet

123
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,319
It's smooth, but not perfectly

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,659
To put that number in perspective, the human body contains about 10^27 atoms

125
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,279
That's 10 powers of 10 less than the surface of the Earth

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,979
10 powers of 10 is 10 billion

127
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,999
There are about 7.5 billion humans

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,059
So, more or less, it can be said that there are the same number of atoms in every human body right now

129
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,559
as there are on the surface of the Earth

130
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,159
As I've shown before, all human bodies piled into one place would barely even fill the Grand Canyon,

131
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:29,079
but all human atoms spread across the Earth would almost perfectly cover it just one atom deep

132
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,819
Fun fact: the mass of the atmosphere is about 2.5% less

133
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,639
than what you would get by multiplying sea level pressure (14.7 psi) by the surface area of the Earth

134
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,239
because Earth's terrain displaces about that much air

135
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,399
Huh, Earth's surface is pretty cool

136
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,199
Obviously, I mean it got lichen and monster trucks

137
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,299
and an island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island

138
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,459
But from down here, on its surface, we just can't see that much of it

139
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,139
Your view of Earth is obstructed by lots of opaque things: walls, buildings, trees, rocks, terrain

140
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:19,599
If Earth was flat, you could see further, but sorry, it's a rough world out there

141
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,959
Or is it?

142
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,799
If you could hold the Earth in your hands like this, how bumpy would it actually feel?

143
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,179
We already saw that even our planet's biggest bumps barely register relative to Earth's size

144
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,419
But let's go somewhere famously flat,

145
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,599
where relative to our size, terrain rarely gets in the way of seeing lots of the planet:

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,059
the US state of Kansas

147
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,559
I grew up here and took this footage while driving across the state last year

148
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,259
You can probably see why Kansas is often called "flatter than a pancake"

149
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:00,679
However, although it is famously flat, Kansas is not the flattest US state

150
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,459
In a fantastic piece of research, Jerome Dobson and Joshua Campbell defined "looks flat" like this:

151
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:15,879
if, from a given point, any part of the terrain within the horizon rises more than 0.32° up

152
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,979
(about the height of a 30 m hill at the horizon),

153
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,719
a typical person would say, "Hey! That part's not flat!"

154
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:31,139
By cleverly applying this rule to topographical data, they were able to give every state a flatness score

155
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,599
West Virginia was the least flat

156
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,539
Kansas was only the seventh flattest

157
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,499
Delaware, Minnesota, Louisiana, North Dakota and Illinois are all, by this method, flatter than Kansas

158
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,259
As was the number 1 flattest state: Florida

159
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,019
Adam Savage and I had the pleasure of visiting Florida with our Brain Candy Live show this year,

160
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:02,519
and as this footage from atop the King Center in Melbourne, Florida shows, it's pretty gosh dang flat

161
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,539
Even though Kansas is not the flattest,

162
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,059
it is the state most often ranked flattest when the general population is asked

163
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,619
It is truly, scientifically flatter than a pancake—it's been demonstrated

164
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,979
But there's more to the story than that

165
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:25,479
In 2003, researchers took a 130 mm wide pancake procured from IHOP and analysed its local reliefs

166
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,439
They found the difference between high and low points was on the order of about 2 mm

167
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,879
If a typical pancake like this was the size of Kansas, 5 million times larger,

168
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,179
2 mm high peaks would be 10 km high mountains

169
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,559
In comparison, Mount Everest is only about 8.8 km tall

170
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,619
and Earth's deepest scar, the Marianas Trench, is thought to be just under 11 km deep

171
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:02,579
So, not only is Kansas about as smooth as a pancake, but so is every other state in the union

172
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,659
and so is the entire world

173
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,939
If you were a giant holding the planet in your hands like this,

174
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,599
you and it would be torn apart by the immense tidal forces created by your gravities

175
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,699
If somehow you could avoid that though,

176
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,499
the planet would feel not much rougher than running your hands over a pancake

177
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,899
But a soggy one, right?

178
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,539
I mean, most of Earth's surface is covered in water—your hands would get wet

179
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,279
Or would they?

180
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,199
Yes, Earth is covered in liquid, but the depth of that liquid, like the mountains above,

181
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,239
just doesn't compare to the total size of the planet

182
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,419
As it turns out, if the Earth was the size of a typical classroom globe like this one, 1 ft in diameter,

183
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:58,719
the volume of water contained in, above and on it would only be about 14 mL

184
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,979
That's this much water

185
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,559
It's kinda hard to believe because at this scale, spreading this much water across all of the ocean surfaces

186
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,099
would be pretty much impossible due to surface tension

187
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,219
But, this is it:

188
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,279
all of Earth's water compared to all of Earth

189
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,479
90% of the space on our planet life can live in is in here

190
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,519
The other 10% is dry land

191
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,979
So, no, you wouldn't get wrinkly fingers playing with an Earth like this

192
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,059
You could sop it dry just with a paper towel

193
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,119
Despite the incredible area oceans cover on our planet,

194
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,899
their depth is just nothing compared to the size of our entire planet

195
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,379
You may have heard it said that if the entire planet were shrunk down to the size of a billiard ball,

196
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,879
it would be smoother than a billiard ball

197
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,359
After all we've seen so far, that seems believable, but as it turns out, it's not true

198
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,279
The misconception stems from the interpretation of the World Pool-Billiard Association's rules

199
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:09,439
According to them, a ball must have a diameter of 2.25 in ± 0.005 in

200
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,779
Some writers have taken this to mean that pits and bumps of 0.005 in are allowed

201
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,419
Proportionately, on Earth, that would mean a mountain that was 28 km high

202
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,359
So, since Earth has none of those, Earth must be smoother than a billiard ball

203
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,399
Except if bumps that high were actually allowed on a pool ball,

204
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,979
a ball covered with 120 grit sandpaper would be within regulation

205
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:43,399
Clearly, the 0.005 in rule is more about roundness, deviation from a sphere, and not texture

206
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:52,359
In fact, as microscopic photography has shown, imperfections on regulation balls are only 1/100,000 in,

207
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,719
or about 0.5 μm deep and high

208
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:03,459
Scaled to the size of a billiard ball, Earth's Marianas Trench would be 49 μm deep

209
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:10,499
So, Earth is smoother than a pancake but not smoother than a billiard ball

210
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,199
Nor, as xkcd wonderfully showed, is Earth smoother than a bowling ball

211
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:23,019
But hold on, earlier we were using the word "flat", now we were using the word "smooth"

212
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,679
That distinction is important

213
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,019
You see, the Earth isn't flat like a plane (or is it?)

214
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,939
Instead, it curves

215
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,479
It's a ball

216
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,719
Pieces of Earth, like Kansas, might be quite smooth, but they curve along with Earth

217
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,279
If you were to stand in the middle of Kansas,

218
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,159
people on the eastern or western edges of the state would appear to be, not level with you,

219
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,759
but about 8.1 km below you

220
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,999
That's nearly the height of Everest

221
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,739
And if they stood straight up, they'd be tilted nearly 2° relative to where you thought up was

222
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,679
Here is an interesting coincidence:

223
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:12,318
generally speaking, 1 mi from where you are, Earth curves down about 8 in;

224
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,519
1 km from where you stand, it curves down about 8 cm

225
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,799
The rate of drop due to curvature isn't a linear one

226
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,019
You can't just multiply any distance by 8 to get the drop due to curvature

227
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,499
Instead, use an online calculator like the one I have linked down in this video's description

228
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,019
You can put in any distance you want

229
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,499
Anyway, the visibility limit caused by Earth's curvature is your horizon

230
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,299
It encircles you like a visual cage,

231
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,459
but it's a cage whose radius is determined by how high up your eyes are

232
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,559
Conan O'Brien, at 6 ft 4 in tall, can see up to 5 km in any direction,

233
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,379
but Snooki, at 4 ft 8 in, can only see about 4.3 km

234
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,839
To find out how far away your horizon is,

235
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,799
geometrically, just use the online tools I've put down in the description below

236
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:14,239
Earth's texture can get in the way of your horizon but can also cause things beyond the horizon to peek into view

237
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,079
HeyWhatsThat.com factors all of this in

238
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,699
If Earth was a smooth sphere, the view from atop Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the British Isles,

239
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:30,659
would end at the horizon 131 km away (about 80 mi)

240
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,779
Such an area would look like this

241
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:39,699
But factoring in Earth's ups and downs, here's a more precise boundary of what you can see

242
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,999
Loch Treig, Scottish Gaelic for "lake of death", is only about 10 mi from the peak

243
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,839
That's within an 80 mi radius, but it can't be seen because terrain in the way blocks it

244
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,199
Parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea 8 times further away can be seen

245
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,359
They lie at the limit of the Earth's curvature, just before it bends the surface out of sight

246
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,659
These spikes extending beyond the geometric horizon

247
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,919
are caused by things beyond it that are tall enough to peek above Earth's curvature

248
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,339
In the case of Ben Nevis, this includes high elevation parts of Northern Ireland

249
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,339
OK, enough about the surface and what it's like close up, let's go further away and see more

250
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,679
This'll be fun, but there'll be a trade-off

251
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,299
The further away you are from something, the smaller it will appear to be

252
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:36,359
Moving away from Earth will make more area available to see, but that area will take up less of your field of view

253
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,619
It can be difficult to illustrate this in a YouTube video,

254
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,339
because your field of view, the shape and size of what you can see with you head still,

255
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:54,699
just by moving your eyes around, is about 120° up and down and more than 180° horizontal

256
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:02,939
A screen is just a window of that space—nowhere close to filling it, unless you get uncomfortably close

257
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:09,239
To help us visualize large apparent sizes, let's replace the spherical Earth with a flat disk

258
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,099
that's always the same distance from the observer

259
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,139
This disk can be given an apparent size equal to Earth's from any altitude,

260
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:23,919
and the disk can contain on it everything that would fit within your horizons from any altitude

261
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:33,359
OK, so, standing on the surface looking straight down, Earth will take up nearly a full 180° of your field of view

262
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,359
With your arms extended straight out, parallel to Earth,

263
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,379
your fingers will point to the edges of the planet: your horizon

264
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:48,119
From 400 km up, about where the ISS orbits, 3% of the Earth's surface is within your horizon,

265
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,379
but the Earth will only take up about 140° of your vision

266
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,299
Your fingers would point to Earth's edges if you narrowed your arms' angles,

267
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,739
each by the width of two outstretched fists

268
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,939
One fist is about 10° across at arm's length

269
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:10,279
You can move your eyes from edge to edge horizontally here, but you can't quite take in the full width vertically

270
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:18,299
But from more than twice this altitude, 1000 km away, Earth is only 120° across

271
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,559
That's one less fist width each

272
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,559
This is perfect

273
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,539
That fits within our narrower vertical field of view

274
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,259
So, from 1000 km up (about 620 mi),

275
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,659
you can just start to see Earth as a complete disk right in front of you at once

276
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,519
However,  only 7% of Earth fits within the horizon form up here

277
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,219
Images of Earth taken by satellites this far up, like the Suomi NPP, look kinda weird

278
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,739
I mean, North America doesn't actually take up this much of the globe

279
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,839
Earth's 120° width has been compressed to fit in an image much narrower

280
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,199
Compare Africa from its height to the famous blue marble picture taken from 45,000 km away

281
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,099
The latter looks more realistic, like looking at a globe on your desk

282
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,359
Geosynchronous satellites are about 35,000 km high

283
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,319
From their altitude, 43.4%—nearly a whole half—of Earth's surface is visible,

284
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,039
but the Earth only takes up a meager 17°

285
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,219
You could completely cover it with two outstretched palms

286
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,779
That's incredible

287
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,939
But what about from the Moon?

288
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,439
Well, from that far away, Earth is only about 2° across

289
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,879
You could block it out with your outstretched thumb

290
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,999
However, you can see more of Earth—you can see further around its curvature

291
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,019
From the Moon, 49% of Earth's surface is visible

292
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,939
Just 49

293
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:59,379
If you want to see 50, half of Earth's surface at once, you have to go even further away

294
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,499
In fact, you have to go infinitely far away, which you can't

295
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,319
The most of a sphere you can see at once with your own eyes is just half

296
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,119
But in the real world, way before you were actually infinitely far away,

297
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,279
the amount of light reaching you from Earth's surface

298
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,019
would become so small and infrequent that you wouldn't be able to see anything at all

299
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,499
Stars, like our Sun, are much brighter and bigger than the Earth,

300
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:34,959
but only a handful have, even with our best technology, been resolved as anything larger than just a single point

301
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,839
From 1/1000 of a light-year away, our own Sun would look like every other star in the sky:

302
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:49,539
a single point to the naked eye, only about as wide as R Doradus, the widest star in our sky

303
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:58,799
From 91 light-years away, the point of our Sun would dim to a level undetectable by the naked eye

304
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,479
It would disappear

305
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,819
Most of the stars in the night sky you can see with your naked eye are further away than that,

306
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,179
we can see them though because they're brighter and bigger than our own Sun,

307
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:16,259
which means if there's life out there, living in systems around the stars we've marvelled at

308
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,359
and written stories about since humanity began,

309
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,779
chances are, we are not part of their constellations or folklore

310
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,319
We're a dark patch in the sky to them,

311
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,699
an ignorable emptiness framing other stars, the ones they marvel at

312
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,439
while not knowing we're here, or that there is anything here

313
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,179
And as always, thanks for watching!

314
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:59,739

00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,019
This shirt comes in the latest box

320
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,839
If you sign up now, you will get this shirt, so long as you sign up before it sells out

321
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,299
The Curiosity Box is good for all brains

322
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:36,239
It comes to your door, 4 times a year, full of science gear and toys that I want you to have,

323
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,099
I want you to hold and learn from

324
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,619
Also, a portion of the proceeds from every box goes to Alzheimer's research

325
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,079
I'm incredibly proud of it

326
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,699
But what's going on on this shirt?

327
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,219
Well, it's modular multiplication around a circle

328
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:57,119
We have the numbers 1 to 40, around the outside of a circle, connected to their product with the number 4

329
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,039
So, 1 is connected to 4, 2 is connected to 8, 3 is connected to 12 and so on, even past 40

330
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,259
You could keep imagining the numbers continuing

331
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,419
For instance, 1 can become 41, 2 can become 42

332
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,559
And this emerges—the Vsauce V

333
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,639
Many other shapes can be made by using different multipliers or different numbers around the circle

334
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,219
Mathologer has a fantastic video on this topic, which you should check out

335
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,399
I have linked it down in the description

336
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,600
Thank you for being curious and as always, thanks for watching!
