00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,058
Hey, Vsauce.

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,718
Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,819
in honour of mistakes. Mistakes are

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,619
everywhere, they surround us like air

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,278
To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,339
and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,549
as the stuff we've gotten right. For instance,

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,569
if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee,

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,029
why would there be so many "k"s?

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,018
Well, the "k"s are silent by mistake.

11
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:45,878
The original old English forms of these
words were pronounced with "k"

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,419
sounds.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,539
K-nife, k-night, k-nee.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,608
But that's a bit of a mouthful to say and
because reading and writing weren't as

15
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,428
common hundreds of years ago,

16
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:01,619
people just pronounced words the way
they want to do, regardless of spelling.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,549
Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what
I'm talking about. In the fourth

18
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,669
verse of his "What's Next", he asks what's next.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,699
What's next, what's N-X-E-T

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,939
Spelling isn't the only thing

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,109
we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,929
of dead an abandoned ideas.
Fritz Machlup coined the phrase

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,279
"Half-life of knowledge". The amount of time
it takes for half of the knowledge

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,509
within a field

25
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,509
to be superseded by new, better ideas
or to simply be shown

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,809
untrue. Donald Hebb famously

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,879
estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,759
is just five years.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,979
Humans are awesome, don't get me wrong,
but we tend to believe that what we currently

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,159
think we know about the universe

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,279
is reasonably correct, even though statistics

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,909
aren't on our side. Previous generations

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,369
incorrectly thought the exact same thing
about what they used to think was true.

34
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,889
My favourite examples of the ubiquity
of mistakes are production

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,018
errors in popular songs. They're like

36
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,968
humbling Easter eggs, just waiting
to be found. For instance, 

37
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,679
Buffalo Springfield's "For What It's Worth".

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,839
26 second in the "be" in the lyric

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,248
"beware" is clipped, as is the "p"

40
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:30,119
in "people" at 1:24 minute. Once you hear the mistake,

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,919
it's tough to unhear it. In "Hey Jude"

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,208
Paul McCartney misses a cord. And if you
listen closely you can clearly hear him

43
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:39,888
say

44
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:44,149
"F***ing h*ll". Seriously, it's in the actual song.

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,568
Go listen to it. In fact, there's an entire
website that chronicles

46
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,568
mistakes in Beatles' songs. Take a look at this

47
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,259
700-year-old prayer book. A monk

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,379
wrote it on fresh, clean paper.

49
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,699
I'm kidding, of course. He scraped the ink
off an older manuscript, cut the pages and

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,018
rotated them before

51
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,468
writing all over them. A mistake? Well,

52
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,458
kind of. Recent multispectral images

53
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,669
of the prayer book have revealed that
the old manuscript he

54
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,518
erased was a previously unknown copy of a work

55
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,998
by Archimedes. It was called "The Method"

56
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:27,548
and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years

57
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,649
before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk

58
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,108
hadn't erased that one book, would we be

59
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,488
hundreds, thousands of years
mathematically and technologically more

60
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:39,589
advanced today

61
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,869
than we currently are? It's hard to say.

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,298
All that is certain is that we would
continue to make ridiculous mistakes,

63
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:47,738
like

64
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,539
the Mars Climate Orbiter.
This 327.6 million dollar expedition

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,339
burned up in the red planet's atmosphere because

66
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,808
when calculating flight manoeuvres NASA
used the agreed-upon metric units

67
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:08,019
while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system.

68
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,548
This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind's first steps

69
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,798
on the Moon. It's about the best footage

70
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,809
we have. The original tapes containing
the highest quality recording

71
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,128
of that moment have been lost. They were probably

72
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,758
recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago

73
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,848
Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while

74
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:34,609
hunting outside of San Diego.
Hoping to attract the attention of

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,019
rescuers, he lit a small fire.

76
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,418
But that fire quickly got out of control
and became a giant Cedar Fire.

77
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,869
It destroyed 300,000 acres of land,

78
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,269
2,322 homes and killed

79
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,158
15 people.

80
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:57,059
The man carrying a wounded soldier in
this painting, based on a photograph

81
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,888
taken during World War I,

82
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,369
is Henry Tandey, an English recipient
of the Victoria Cross.

83
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,218
Four years after the event in this image
Tandey caught a wounded

84
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:12,089
German soldier in his gun sights.
But rather than kill the man,

85
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,128
Tandey took pity on his wounded state
and spared his life.

86
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,248
The German he allowed to live was

87
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:24,698
this man. Later the man whose life he
spared wore his mustache

88
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,709
shorter but still had the same name,

89
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,638
Adolf Hitler. In 1918

90
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,269
did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill
Hitler? Detailed researchers found that

91
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,168
the exact

92
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:42,168
days their units were in the same
location don't quite match up.

93
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,188
The story is apocryphal but what is known

94
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,519
is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting

95
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,008
of Tandey, and in 1938,

96
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:55,818
when meeting with Neville Chamberlain,
Hitler pointed to Tandey

97
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:59,908
and told Chamberlain: "That man came
so close to killing me

98
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,369
in 1918 that I thought I
should never see Germany

99
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,348
again." So, who's wrong?

100
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:11,369
Maybe Hitler confirmed the story

101
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,499
merely because he hoped to make up extra
evidence that providence had kept him

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,468
alive to pursue his goals.

103
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:20,468
Either way, someone

104
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:24,508
is mistaken. Missed opportunities

105
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,188
are a bummer.
Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret

106
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,809
is a powerful emotion. How do you deal

107
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,249
with regret, with guilt?

108
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,898
Can you? In the early morning hours on a
bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this

109
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:43,559
summer

110
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,098
Ze Frank told me something
I am going to paraphrase.

111
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,978
I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past

112
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,559
is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time,

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,398
the scar, the carving won't go away.

114
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,989
Because of the way trees grow it won't
go up or down much either, it'll just

115
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,598
stay right where it began. It might even get darker.

116
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,158
But it won't get bigger. You, however,

117
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:15,799
can. You can keep growing,
doing more things, more branches,

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,778
being more things. The wound won't get
smaller but you can make it a smaller

119
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:22,559
part

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,588
of who you are. Maybe regrets

121
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,728
are like that. They stick around forever

122
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:34,038
like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree

123
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,219
and leaf.

124
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,758
A red or purple leaf in the autumn.
As days get shorter

125
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,049
and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow

126
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,458
and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves,

127
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:53,718
appear as the green fades.
But red and purple leaves

128
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,499
are the interesting ones.
As winter approaches it would seem to be a good

129
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,908
time for trees to conserve energy but some trees

130
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:04,968
do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend

131
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,049
extra energy producing anthocyanins

132
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,749
to turn their leaves red and purple hues.

133
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,918
These colours protect their leaves from
sun damage before their nutrients can

134
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,318
all be

135
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,278
used and may also be a defence
against insects looking for

136
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,098
a parasitic home.
A way for the tree to tell the insects: "Yes,

137
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,978
I am in part dying but not without a fight.

138
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,278
I am still very much vital."

139
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,728
Drought and even turn a kit applied by man

140
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,879
can bring about these colors prematurely.
When you look at beautiful

141
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,419
autumn colours, you are looking at stress.

142
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,629
But the bigger the fight the trees
put up, the more energy

143
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,328
they put into their defences at the
very end, the more brilliant

144
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:54,768
their colours will be. Winter

145
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,109
will eventually come. But scientifically,

146
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,739
the brightest, deepest, most remarkable colours

147
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,509
come from not giving up too easily

148
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,319
or quickly.

149
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,499
And as always,

150
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,000
thanks for watching.
