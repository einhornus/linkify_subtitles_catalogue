1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,309
(Captain)
Hello!  So you want to be a pirate, m'lad?

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,749
Well let me tell ye…

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,169
being a pirate, be all about 'Branding'.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,459
Yar, it’s a business.

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,459
But branding be bringing in the booty.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,019
And if ye be shipping with our jolly crew,

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,509
ye need love this Jolly Roger.

8
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,269
(Recruit)
Question.

9
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,509
Isn't waving a pirate flag like waving a

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,889
'We are Thieves’ flag?

11
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,669
It seems… not helpful.

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,659
(Captain)
This skull and crossbones be more than

13
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,239
just a bit of 'Arrrgh, look at us'.

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,239
It's plumage prerequisite for plundering.

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,959
As pirates, we be wanting booty.

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,349
Booty… be licious!

17
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,339
But parties protect their booty, preferring it unplundered.

18
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,169
So we must plunder asunder.

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,579
Which 'tis a lot of work and risk.

20
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,319
Who needs that?

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,749
See?  We want free booty.

22
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,179
When we ask for booty, booty to be granted, and bounce.

23
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,719
(Recruit)
But why would a ship just give up?

24
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,069
(Captain)
[with emphasis]
The Branding!

25
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,549
Plus a surprise reveal!

26
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,039
Ye were right, we don't fly the flag for fun.

27
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,309
We fly false flags.

28
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,139
Keeping the Roger hidden for just the right moment.

29
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,949
Our ship be lean and mean.

30
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,289
And we hide this too.

31
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,579
With prey in sight, we billow barrels behind.

32
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,459
So though our sails be full, our speed be slow.

33
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,159
And we seem fat and full.

34
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,989
With supplies kept above deck for greater effect.

35
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,329
(Recruit)
Ok, that’s pretty clever.

36
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,309
(Captain)
But this be my favorite… a camouflaged hull!

37
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,879
Painted canvas unfurled to cover the true number of guns.

38
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,769
Behold!

39
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,209
(Recruit)
That looks pretty fake.

40
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,379
(Captain)
Yar, it need only look good from afar.

41
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,529
Ships be seen at a distance.

42
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,779
Through a looking glass.

43
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,169
On the high seas.

44
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,419
Branding is image, not reality.

45
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,719
And Empire and merchants do the reverse.

46
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,549
Carving and painting fake canon to intimidate.

47
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,419
[gleefully]
But fake guns don't shoot now do they?

48
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,809
So, we be sailing slowly along, all

49
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,899
[politely] “How do you do, fellow countrymen?”

50
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,899
Then, when close enough… the reveal!

51
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,519
Cutting our cover, unfurling the flag,

52
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,169
ditching the drag, and sullying pantaloons.

53
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,129
[with emphasis]
That's branding.

54
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,279
Do it right and they won't fight.

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,259
(Recruit)
Why, again?

56
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,259
I feel like you're not answering this question.

57
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,159
(Captain)
Look, think like one of those poor seaman sods yonder.

58
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,909
Imagine ye be working for the Empire, minding yourself, when,

59
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,799
(Pirates)
[cheerfully]
“Surprise!  Pirates!  Please present your booty.”

60
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,759
(Empire Captain)
[under his breath]
Ughh, this guy is the worst.

61
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,489
(Captain)
Your captain can choose to fight or not.

62
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,288
[playfully]
But, if ye fight, and if ye lose,

63
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,809
[ominously]
we will torture crewmen to death while others watch.

64
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,689
(Recruit)
Oh… that's not jolly.  That's not jolly at all.

65
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,589
(Captain)
Look, sometimes misguided men will try to hide booty.

66
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,659
And we can't have that.

67
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,529
We don't want to torture, understand.

68
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,489
I scorn to do any one a mischief, when it not for my advantage.

69
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,709
But brands must mean something.

70
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,829
And torturing over hidden treasure is quite memorable.

71
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,649
Which generates effective word of mouth marketing.

72
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,369
At least from those who have told us the truth about hidden treasure.

73
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,549
And thus get to keep their tongues.

74
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,399
(Recruit)
Ah.

75
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,299
(Captain)
So be the sailor's choice.

76
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,199
Fight, lose, maybe torture for you, maybe death for you.

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,769
Pirates get booty anyway.

78
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,169
What a hassle for nothing.

79
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,779
And we make it so easy to give up.

80
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,169
If your captain simply surrenders, we leave everyone alone.

81
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,949
No fighting.

82
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,849
[menacingly]
No torture.

83
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,739
Just a transference of booty

84
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,269
between ships passing on the high seas.

85
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,179
On the other hand,

86
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,819
you could fight and you might win,

87
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,579
though maybe as less of a man than before.

88
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,429
But lose, and you might beg for mercy in the last

89
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,429
and longest moments of your life.

90
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,439
[affectionately]
Boop!

91
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,239
The flag we raise lets ye know your options

92
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,809
before loading that canon.

93
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,279
And we have one more surrender incentive.

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,549
Say the target captain calls his men

95
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,249
to fight to protect his booty.

96
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,909
That captain is a fool.

97
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,239
And probably cruel.

98
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,859
Treating his men like mule.

99
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,859
Feeding them gruel.

100
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,249
While admiring a jewel.

101
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,249
The whole crew sick of his rule.

102
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,279
When they see our flag and the captain's command,

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,749
the crew can mutiny.

104
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,969
Letting us aboard without resistance.

105
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,809
And, as thanks for their assistance,

106
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,069
we be holding a court.

107
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,389
A court of the captain where his crew can complain.

108
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,469
Knowing this chance corrodes a captain's

109
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,319
confidence in command, given the crew's critique

110
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,369
of his conduct could conclude his career.

111
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,069
[merrily]
It's hilarious.

112
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,609
Though the Empire calls us outlaws,

113
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,149
we also be angels of vengeance on the high seas.

114
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,429
What branding!

115
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,699
Terror and mercy and justice combined!

116
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,879
[with emotion]
It's beautiful!

117
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,879
So… that's the pirate’s life.

118
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,429
Sure, the Empire’s noose will dangle over your head.

119
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,409
[passionately]
But you'll have brothers in arms and booty in hand.

120
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,619
What say ye?

121
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,870
(Recruit)
I'd like to talk to that guy before I decide.
