00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,629
Hello Internet,

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,449
Recently YouTube invited me to California
for a conference with a bunch of really interesting

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,449
people.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,380
There were many talks and giant balloons and
much discussion of what the future of education

5
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:14,689
might look like -- which is no small issue
because how society raises the next generation

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,429
of scientists, doctors, and programmers shapes
the future of human civilization.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,309
It was an amazing few days and, if you'll
tolerate my ramblings, I'd like to share some

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,499
of my thoughts on this as someone who's worked
as an educator both in and out of schools.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,329
So this is how schools have pretty much always
looked: a guy in the front who knows all the

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,229
things and students who don't so the guy tells
them.

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,599
But a teacher explains things at the right
pace for maybe *one* student in the room during

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,689
a lesson.

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,819
Everyone else is either bored because they
already understand the material or lost because

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,969
they're missing knowledge they should already
have.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,149
But, at the end of the lesson, regardless
of student understanding, the circeirculem

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,989
marches rentlessly on.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,889
And whether the teachers use a blackboard,
whiteboard or smart board and whether students

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,828
use tables, or paper, or tablets (again) this
system really isn't any different -- it's

19
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,779
just technology doing the same thing in a
shiner way.

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,908
But the Internet is different and behind the
scenes something interesting is happening

21
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:10,519
that hints at the shape of things to come.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,618
In a perfect school, each student would have
a personal tutor, like Aristotle to Alexander

23
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:16,618
the great.

24
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,809
But if your education policy is 'Aristotle
for everyone' then there are three big problems

25
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,809
with this:

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,688
1st) There aren't enough humans on Earth to
individually tutor every child, and even if

27
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:30,178
there were it would be horrifically expensive
and even if neither manpower nor money was

28
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:34,188
a problem not everyone is as good a tutor
as Aristotle.

29
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,228
But technology is solving these problems:
starting with number 1:

30
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,458
For who needs humans when the Internet can
teach you all the things?

31
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,508
Want to learn calculus: get started.

32
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,199
Need an AP biology course?

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,118
Go watch this one along with hundreds of thousands
of other students.

34
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,328
The Internet massively multiplies the audience
of potential teachers and solves the manpower

35
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,328
problem.

36
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,270
But isn't cheerleading the Internet the same
thing I was complaining about before: new

37
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:01,298
tech doing old things just with more shiny?

38
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,169
After all if you were a pre-Internet child,
with bookish inclinations, there's *always*

39
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,328
been a place to teach you all the things.

40
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,888
And people thought that radio and TV were
going to revolutionize education by giving

41
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,579
teachers huge audiences, but here we still
are.

42
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,859
These are good points but Internet also solves
the cost problem in a way that Radio and TV

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,039
never could.

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,699
Real shows are expensive to make and even
the best of educational TV often gets pushed

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,109
aside for dumber, more popular stuff that,
not coincidently, is also more profitable.

46
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,949
This is known as the History Channel Effect.

47
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,449
But the cost to access to the Internet is
only going down, as is the cost to make stuff

48
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,579
for the Internet.

49
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,019
Which is why a guy with some paper and a marker
in his bedroom can pull in a million views

50
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,839
a month at essentially zero cost and doesn't
have to worry about competition from stuff

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,839
like this.

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,059
So the Internet solves problems one and two,
but educational videos still aren't personalized

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,429
to students and that leaves YouTube still
as a library of video, not a tutor like Aristotle.

54
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,049
But you can build on top of YouTube and what
I see coming is this: Digital Aristotle for

55
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,049
everyone.

56
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,219
A computer program that tutors students individually,
by pulling from a library of videos like YouTube,

57
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,279
a program that tests students on what they
know and, more importantly, adapts to the

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,389
way they learn over time by comparing the
effectiveness of different videos and different

59
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,989
tests to discover scientifically, what works
best.

60
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:29,039
This isn't a fantasy, there are people building
parts of this right now (even if Digital Aristotle

61
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,729
isn't their explicit goal).

62
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,249
And one of these places is The Khan Academy
which is more than just Sal's soothing voice.

63
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,568
If this does not blow your mind, you have
no emotion.

64
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:46,209
Behind the website is incredibly complicated
software testing everything about student

65
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,239
learning: the effectiveness of different videos,
different tests, and different ways of asking

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,379
questions.

67
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,629
And while it may seem primitive now, technology
only gets better, faster.

68
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,129
When Digital Aristotle arrives it will be
cheaper, less labor intensive and better than

69
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,219
human teachers ever could be.

70
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,679
I often hear the argument that Digital Aristotle,
or something like it, will free teachers to

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,879
float around the classroom helping kids works
on interesting projects -- and while that

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,208
might happen in the near-term, I don't think
that's the long-term reality.

73
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,898
For what happens when Digital Aristotle truly
knows students better than the teacher?

74
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,388
When, for every topic of human endeavor, it's
able to take the best and brightest kids farther

75
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,749
down the path of knowledge than their teachers
ever could?

76
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,149
I doubt that schools will go away -- after
all they aren't just about learning but are

77
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,249
also freeing parents to work in the economy
while their feral children are turned into

78
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,598
civilized adults -- but schools will be radically
different and there will be far fewer teachers

79
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,269
working in them doing far less.

80
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,478
And while that's not great news for teachers,
it's awesome news for students and society.

81
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,400
Right now, if you're a student doing poorly
school moves on without you and if you're

82
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,388
doing well, school holds you back.

83
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,989
In the future, I see every human using a Digital
Aristotle for their whole life, a tutor personalized

84
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,788
to them, teaching them exactly what they need
to learn when they're best ready for it and

85
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:12,998
when that comes, we'll have both a better
educational system and a better society.

86
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:19,288
I want to thank YouTube EDU and the people
who ran it for bringing me out to California

87
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:21,218
to meet up with these awesome people.

88
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:25,038
I had more interesting conversations over
the space of a few days than I normally get

89
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,068
to have over the space of a few months.

90
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,378
If you want to see what the best of education
looks like right now, go check out their channels

91
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,539
and if you want to hear more on this topic,
I've also put together a playlist of talks

92
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,160
on this topic I hope you like.
