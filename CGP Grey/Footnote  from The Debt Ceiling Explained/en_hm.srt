1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,239
The President can veto Congress' budget,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,319
but Congress, with enough votes, can override that veto.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,399
So while negotiations may happen between the two branches if Congress can't get enough votes to override a veto,

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,759
ultimately the responsibility for government spending

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,686
lies with Congress. They alone have the power to specify taxes and spending,

6
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:18,959
while the President has the power to say no,

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,580
but can be overruled.
