1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,584
As Mark Twain once quipped,

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:04,289
"If I had more time I would have written a shorter letter."

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,166
There's a pair of videos on my channel

4
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:08,049
that were in the works for over a year.

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,184
The Tekoi Videos.

6
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:11,671
One exploration and one explanation.

7
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:14,071
And while the exploration video is fine,

8
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:17,489
I made a catastrophic error in the explanation video.

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,140
I've re-uploaded a corrected version,

10
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,809
and I've also made this video

11
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,547
to show you some of the behind-the-scenes

12
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,164
of how those videos got made,

13
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:25,444
how the error got in,

14
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:28,136
and how the decision to re-upload came to be.

15
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:31,576
But I've written this video in as little time as possible

16
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:34,130
to correct the error as fast as possible.

17
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:35,307
So, be warned.

18
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:36,450
It's a long letter.

19
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:39,296
The story of Tekoi starts with Past-Grey traveling

20
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:42,193
to Indian reservations for… an other project.

21
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:43,273
During that wandering,

22
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,907
I came across the Skull Valley Indian Reservation

23
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:48,130
out in Utah, and within its borders,

24
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,381
the Tekoi Test Range,

25
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,290
information about which was limited and scattered.

26
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,684
I got the impression it was an

27
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,713
abandoned military weapons facility.

28
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:56,444
Which, come on!

29
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:58,033
Three more intriguing adjectives

30
00:00:58,034 --> 00:00:59,690
you could not precede a noun.

31
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:00,673
At this point on YouTube,

32
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:01,701
I'd played around with making

33
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:03,301
a few vlog-style videos,

34
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:05,204
and while working on the bigger project,

35
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:07,639
I thought Tekoi could be a little shard to examine

36
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,639
to make into an easy and quick vlog,

37
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,090
exploring the place and explaining what it was.

38
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:13,839
And the Tribal Government graciously

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,324
granted me permission to go on site and film.

40
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,907
Which, as a side note, please do not try to visit Tekoi.

41
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,141
It is private property,

42
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:21,381
not open to the public,

43
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,781
and super dangerous.

44
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,981
In retrospect, I was shockingly stupid

45
00:01:24,982 --> 00:01:27,479
to explore it in as unprepared fashion as I did.

46
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,787
But, I went, I filmed.

47
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,273
I didn't fall in a hole and die,

48
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,787
or catch histoplasmosis from the

49
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:32,833
bat droppings everywhere.

50
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:33,839
And I didn't get attacked by

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,267
the "really mean owl" I was warned

52
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:37,581
defended warehouse number…

53
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:39,387
Oh, I forgot to write it down!

54
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:39,901
Seriously.

55
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:42,004
I could not have been a worse UrbEx newb.

56
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,239
But the celestial dice rolled in my favor that day

57
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,073
and I got back to my hotel with some amazing video.

58
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,187
Now all I needed to do

59
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:49,821
was explain this beautiful shard.

60
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:51,747
Of course, joke was on me because

61
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:53,559
every topic is an entire world

62
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,393
unto itself once you start looking,

63
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:58,130
and months later, the one video split into two

64
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,736
and I was barely closer to a

65
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:02,519
coherent explanation of Tekoi then at the start.

66
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,536
Okay, pause here,

67
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,793
and let me tell you a little about

68
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:06,793
the video production process in general.

69
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,959
Videos get started either through wandering

70
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,821
the real world or

71
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:11,020
the Forest of All Knowledge,

72
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:12,439
seeing an interesting area,

73
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,976
exploring it and, if lucky,

74
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:16,233
some part will look like it could be a video.

75
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:18,539
I've come to accept that I am a slow writer,

76
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,296
so it's best to hold off the first serious draft

77
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:23,701
until long into the exploration phase.

78
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:26,073
Often long enough that by the time I get to the

79
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:28,587
"Okay, seriously, sit down and write this thing,"

80
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,719
I've forgotten a lot of what I've read.

81
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,856
But that's actually a useful way to filter

82
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:34,599
for the interesting and important

83
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,387
and frequent ideas in a topic

84
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:38,119
before the many, many rounds

85
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,776
of revisions and checks to come.

86
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:41,633
I used to make my videos all alone,

87
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,633
but over the years, I've gathered a small team,

88
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:44,884
and at some point,

89
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:47,741
if I can get the script into a readable "ish" version,

90
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:50,741
it's time to let the team know what the next project might be.

91
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:53,519
And there is celebration or dread at what will be

92
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,461
at least many weeks of their lives spent on this thing.

93
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:57,644
Everyone has a specialty.

94
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:58,216
Animation

95
00:02:58,217 --> 00:02:58,673
Research

96
00:02:58,674 --> 00:02:59,189
Logistics

97
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,524
Music

98
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:01,353
Sometimes custom artwork or audio.

99
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:04,159
And everyone provides useful feedback on the topic,

100
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,930
sometimes having personal experience,

101
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,330
or finding further details,

102
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,564
or hunting down related lost artifacts.

103
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,084
For me, there's also a lot of double-checking at this point,

104
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:14,656
going back to notes I made during exploration time,

105
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:17,296
or looking into an out-of-place-seeming fact.

106
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,667
The script eventually progresses from merely readable

107
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:22,016
into what is nearing a final (ish) form,

108
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:24,313
and this is were it's sent out to experts.

109
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,999
Now this phase seems like it should be the easiest.

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,564
A teacher checks your homework.

111
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:30,227
But often it's quite troublesome.

112
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:32,296
The first problem is finding an expert.

113
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:35,787
If the video ends up being largely a book or a paper adaptation,

114
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:37,130
and the author is alive,

115
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:38,519
then that's pretty easy,

116
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,856
and those projects are generally more straightforward.

117
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:41,969
But for a lot of videos,

118
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,089
figuring out who is the expert on this thing

119
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,359
isn't always clear.

120
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,501
And for some topics,

121
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:48,959
there simply isn't anyone.

122
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,679
For others, experts may exist,

123
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,701
but finding them is basically impossible

124
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:55,776
because there isn't a good public record of their expertise.

125
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,947
This last is particularly frustrating because,

126
00:03:57,948 --> 00:03:59,867
the instant the final video goes up,

127
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:03,473
all the un-findable experts will find it and get in touch.

128
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:05,473
Now, in theory, this problem could be solved

129
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:07,976
by publicly announcing what the active topics are.

130
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:10,187
And back when Past-Grey's channel was smaller

131
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,850
and he younger and naiver,

132
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,513
that's totally a thing he did.

133
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,050
But Current-Grey in current year

134
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:16,958
has seen shockingly blatant cases

135
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,307
of those who work fast scooping topics

136
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:20,610
from those who work slow.

137
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,044
It's not the early days of the Internet any more,

138
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,953
and surviving while supporting a team

139
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:26,524
means you must compete with

140
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:30,299
The Entire Entertainment Industry in all its forms.

141
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,050
So, some secrecy is necessary.

142
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,370
Even though, yes, I'm fully aware I've already divulged

143
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:35,970
what I'm working on in this very video,

144
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,056
and I will do it again later,

145
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,010
but I'm made an exception.

146
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,307
Even though I know from experience

147
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:42,347
I've never not regretted talking about work in progress.

148
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,239
Even if the topic is un-scooped or un-scoopable,

149
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,981
I just find projects harder to finish

150
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,136
once they're out in the open

151
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:49,559
and everyone is watching.

152
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,616
Back to the experts.

153
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:52,381
If they exist and we find them,

154
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:53,684
and they're willing to help out,

155
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:55,099
and they're willing to keep a secret

156
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,027
(for possibly months),

157
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,033
then that's great.

158
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:58,387
But it can still be tricky.

159
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:00,124
For example, which experts?

160
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,673
Just about any academic topic will have experts

161
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:04,381
who have spent their entire lives

162
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:06,296
thinking about this one area

163
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:09,216
and who also violently disagree with each other.

164
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:11,890
Which can leave you, the non-expert, to wander

165
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:14,530
dangerously close to the "What is True?" dimension,

166
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,673
which, if you're not careful,

167
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,119
will suck you into an unproductive, downward spiral

168
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,799
of "How do we know anything is true?"

169
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,490
This happens to me a least once a month

170
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:24,019
and is a topic which is way beyond

171
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,149
the scope of this video.

172
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,739
Maybe a story for another time.

173
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,130
[under his breath]
Ugh, don't say that!

174
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:29,804
Okay, skipping the existential crisis,

175
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:31,679
the script is sent out to experts for checking

176
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,656
and then the final draft can be recorded

177
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:35,656
and turned into a video for you to watch.

178
00:05:35,657 --> 00:05:37,073
That's how it works in general.

179
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,010
Now let's resume the story of Tekoi,

180
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,130
skipping ahead to…

181
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,279
Upload Day!

182
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,913
A day that is simultaneously

183
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:44,050
the joyous completion of hundreds

184
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:44,924
of hours of teamwork and

185
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,713
the solitude of stomach-churning

186
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,496
as you wait to find out if you have been

187
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:49,793
wrong on the Internet.

188
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,587
And there are many ways to be

189
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:52,833
wrong on the Internet,

190
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,907
which we will visit later,

191
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:55,101
but the process is designed

192
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:56,684
to be able to avoid errors

193
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:59,364
while still being able to publish something

194
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:00,147
(eventually).

195
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,164
And in this process,

196
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,753
I have learned that my initial impression

197
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:03,679
wasn't quite right.

198
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,679
Rather, Tekoi was a tiny part

199
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,679
of an enormous for-profit company

200
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,650
that used Tekoi as a static firing test range for rocket motors.

201
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:14,656
Motors that just so happened to be used in nuclear missiles,

202
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:16,124
including the famous Minuteman.

203
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,490
But there's often so much more

204
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:18,930
left on the cutting room floor,

205
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:20,707
so a new part of the process is

206
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,239
doing a director's commentary

207
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,461
for crowdfunders with all the extra bits,

208
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:25,969
after I wait a couple of hours

209
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,290
to ensure there's no Upload Day disaster

210
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,759
that needs immediate attention.

211
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,319
The Internet will tell you real fast if you're wrong.

212
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,016
But on Tekoi Upload Day,

213
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,256
the stomach churning lessened

214
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:36,170
as nothing came in.

215
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,850
I went and streamed the commentary

216
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,981
in a pretty relieved mood,

217
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,507
as this has become a nice, psychological marker for me

218
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:44,729
that a project is truly and completely, finally finished.

219
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,507
Doing the commentary kept me up late,

220
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:49,107
but, satisfied with a long days work, I decided,

221
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,793
right before trying to sleep,

222
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,439
"Let me check the comments one more time."

223
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,810
And that is when I found this:

224
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:58,296
the maximum possible stomach-churning comment,

225
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:00,873
asking the audience to imagine what it would be like

226
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:03,776
to do this whole video with the Minuteman missile,

227
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:06,433
but in the video itself is the evidence that

228
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,204
it wasn't the Minuteman missile.

229
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,650
It was the Trident missile.

230
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:10,929
Oh no.

231
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,330
I didn't have to imagine

232
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,839
what it was like to do this video.

233
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,629
I was the guy who did this video.

234
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,730
Not good.

235
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,107
At the time I read this comment,

236
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,107
basically seconds away from total collapse,

237
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,107
I was in no condition to address it.

238
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,604
But let's just say I didn't sleep well that night,

239
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:26,696
and we'll skip the depressive,

240
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,359
self-destructive, self-doubting part,

241
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,587
and jump back to where,

242
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:30,661
with a rebooted brain,

243
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:32,416
I was able to confirm that yes,

244
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,416
hootis8 was right and I was wrong.

245
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,027
Tekoi did not test Minuteman Missile motors.

246
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,913
Tekoi tested Tridents.

247
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,616
I even found a poster of one in the

248
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,159
exploration video itself!

249
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,924
[Past-Grey from Tekoi exploration video]
Can't see anything down that corridor.

250
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:47,044
Alright, strategic pride!

251
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:49,039
[game show success sound]
ding!

252
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,947
[Current-Grey]
You may be wondering

253
00:07:49,948 --> 00:07:51,759
how I could have spent so long on this topic

254
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,781
and yet missed the answer

255
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:54,416
to the most fundamental question.

256
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,713
The literal video title.

257
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:56,981
"What Was Tekoi?"

258
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:58,079
Well, me too.

259
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,890
So we conducted an autopsy.

260
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:01,341
[under his breath]
Oh God, this is only half-way through.

261
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:02,450
It really is a long letter.

262
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:05,347
Okay, because there was so little available information about Tekoi,

263
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:07,741
in that pre-script early exploration phase,

264
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:10,359
I ended up reading a lot about the Cold War in general,

265
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,267
which was interesting

266
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:12,124
(unlike most history)

267
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,976
but was more than a little infuriating

268
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:16,581
because all the areas right around Tekoi

269
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,113
(the Magna Manufacturing Plant,

270
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:19,147
the Wendover Airfield,

271
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:20,559
the Utah Test and Training Range,

272
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,581
the Dugway Proving Ground)

273
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:22,741
all kept popping up.

274
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:24,827
But never coy Tekoi herself.

275
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:27,627
And this is where some mind muddling began to occur,

276
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:29,701
because, while I learned the United States Cold War

277
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:31,953
nuclear deterrence forces had three branches

278
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:32,776
(land, sea, and air)

279
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,072
most of what I read talked a lot

280
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:35,913
about the ground-based Minuteman missiles,

281
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,456
less so about nuclear bombers,

282
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:39,610
and very little about the nuclear subs.

283
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,181
So, in my mind, the Minutemen became

284
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:42,913
the real stars of the Cold War,

285
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:44,473
which played into the later error.

286
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:46,559
I did eventually find this book about the history

287
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,879
of the Hercules Powder Company that built Tekoi.

288
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,781
And while the book contains more information

289
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:53,067
about a now non-existent chemical manufacturing company

290
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,981
than most people could reasonably want to know,

291
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:57,399
it does not in, its 433 pages,

292
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,399
mention Tekoi even once.

293
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,964
Either because, in comparison to the breathtakingly-large

294
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,416
international scope of the company,

295
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,661
Tekoi was just too small

296
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:06,233
to warrant even a passing mention.

297
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,530
Or because the work at Tekoi was classified.

298
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:09,170
Or both.

299
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:11,433
But I was still determined to make a video

300
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:12,673
about this place I had become

301
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:14,079
more than a little obsessed with

302
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,684
and was now a connection point to

303
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,450
future topics in the Grey-verse.

304
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:18,764
So with what I did have,

305
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,016
I went through the process.

306
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,833
And it is somewhere in the earliest drafts,

307
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:24,896
I wrote down, "Tekoi tested Minuteman missile motors."

308
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,684
That is wrong, but I didn't realize,

309
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:28,684
and it didn't occur to me to double check,

310
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,387
because at this stage, the script was still filled

311
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,387
with show-stopping holes

312
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:35,027
in need of dire attention

313
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:37,393
before the video had a hope of getting published.

314
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:38,073
Holes like:

315
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:39,313
"What are these things for?"

316
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,884
"Why is this building on rails?"

317
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,027
"How did all this work?"

318
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:43,829
Now, finding an expert who could discuss

319
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,730
the classified details of a site involved in

320
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:48,381
nuclear weapons production proved impossible.

321
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,599
While there are people who are experts,

322
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,981
and though Tekoi was abandoned for decades,

323
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,856
the United States government still takes

324
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:56,696
her secrets pretty seriously.

325
00:09:56,697 --> 00:10:00,329
Fun fact: some of the information... uhh... revealed required

326
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,587
legal consultation to determine if it could be

327
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:05,896
publicly discussed without, you know, going to prison.

328
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,181
It was looking pretty bad for the project,

329
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:10,650
but I did get one confidential military expert

330
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,329
who worked at sites like Tekoi

331
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,210
to review an early draft of the video,

332
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,049
and who explained how sites like this worked

333
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,353
and filled in the holes.

334
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:19,861
But they hadn't worked at Tekoi itself,

335
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:22,981
thus had no to reason to know or comment on Tekoi

336
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:26,210
being part of the sea-based arm of nuclear deterrence.

337
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:27,199
Not ground.

338
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,050
So in the script,

339
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,307
this error had no expert to catch it,

340
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:31,879
but also I didn't catch it.

341
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,856
And in the autopsy, it's clear I had not one,

342
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:35,364
not two,

343
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:37,890
but three missed chances to catch the error.

344
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:39,890
First, this test facility footage.

345
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:44,256
[unknown speaker on radio]
This will be the firing of D5 second stage Pet Five B250.

346
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,799
The D5 spoken refers to the D5 motor

347
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,119
of the Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missile.

348
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,073
I did wonder what D5 Pet Five B250 meant,

349
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:54,787
but I assumed it was a serial number or other code.

350
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,084
Typing any version of the spoken words into Google

351
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:58,490
would have been less than enlightening,

352
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,707
but typing D5 missile would have brought me right to it.

353
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,199
Second, the list of inspectable sites for START.

354
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,759
I had been reading about US/USSR negotiations and inspection sites,

355
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,490
but never saw an exact list until I pulled this one

356
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:12,490
from the Federation of American Scientists.

357
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:15,290
Here, I did notice that Tekoi was under the SLBM header

358
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,439
not the ICMB header,

359
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,501
but I didn't investigate,

360
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,496
because at this point,

361
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,090
the video was in final animation

362
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,890
and I was trying to wrap things up,

363
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,610
not wander off the path again.

364
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:25,524
Deciding when to stop tracking down

365
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,959
every little thing is a vital skill if you, say,

366
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,387
ever want to finish a project.

367
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,307
And if you go watch the director's commentary,

368
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,164
you can listen to poor innocent Grey,

369
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,449
who doesn't know what's coming,

370
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,290
discuss that point several times.

371
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,439
But this time, all I had do was but lift

372
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,849
my reluctant eyes to the top of the page

373
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,524
and there behold my answer.

374
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:43,553
SLBM.

375
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:45,650
Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile.

376
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,199
How embarrassing!

377
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,376
But it gets one worse.

378
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:49,347
Missed chance three.

379
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:50,159
The Timeline.

380
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,159
Over the years, one of the most effective tools

381
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,690
I've found to disentangle a complicated subject

382
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:56,067
is the humble timeline.

383
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,067
Sources you discover in a random order

384
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,027
and books often discuss topics out of order

385
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:03,244
so it's clarifying to just write out a list of what happened when.

386
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:06,524
And this often highlights bad or contradictory sources.

387
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,650
This is where I unambiguously failed the hardest.

388
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,467
To simplify, I've been calling the Minuteman Missile "the Minuteman Missile,"

389
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,616
but there's actually three.

390
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:13,353
One. Two. Three.

391
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:15,850
First deployed in '62, '65 and '70.

392
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,856
The United States ordered one thousand to be built

393
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:21,667
and I don't know how long it took to fill that order.

394
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:24,209
Most sources gave a vague the seventies

395
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,170
but maddeningly,

396
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:27,770
in doing another round of investigating for this video,

397
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:32,901
we found government sources ranging from 1977 to 1963.

398
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,444
What the deal is with that I have no idea.

399
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:36,879
I have to stop investigating now,

400
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,461
otherwise this correction video

401
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:39,879
you're hopefully still watching,

402
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,296
will never get published.

403
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:45,010
But, this is exactly how a timeline can show you something's up.

404
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,661
And Past-Grey should have known better

405
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:48,901
than to just accept a vague the seventies

406
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,149
for the full one thousand Minuteman deployment.

407
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,530
That sort of raises a yellow flag in general.

408
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,993
But even if that means the later half of the decade,

409
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:59,027
Tekoi was (probably) built in 1976,

410
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,964
which is a tight timeline to have tested the Minutemen.

411
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,273
This is 100% my fault.

412
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,821
I should have caught this way early in the process,

413
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:08,010
but I just didn't.

414
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,559
Which, well, is why we're all here.

415
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,559
Okay so big deal, you got the wrong missile.

416
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,707
Why not just fix the video and replace it?

417
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,456
A good question that drags us down into

418
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:20,416
the detailed bowels of how YouTube works.

419
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,061
YouTube does not let creators

420
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,770
replace videos with new versions.

421
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:25,770
You have to upload a whole new video,

422
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,227
which risks annoying literally millions of people

423
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:29,816
with redundant notifications

424
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:32,189
(should YouTube choose to send them)

425
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,019
and tempts the YouTube gods

426
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,861
to look unfavorably upon your channel because

427
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:40,009
[as YouTube god bot]
That last video had terrible engagement.

428
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,147
[Current-Grey]
While I will publicly and loudly complain

429
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:44,221
that YouTube won't let creators replace videos,

430
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:45,907
I'm also secretly grateful for this

431
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,067
because it forces a definitive end to projects,

432
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:50,953
without which my channel would doubtless have

433
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:52,627
but a single video still,

434
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:56,153
"The Difference between the United Kingdom, Great Britain and England Explained,"

435
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:58,153
which I would have spent the last ten years

436
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,953
tweaking, revising, expanding, fixing, and fixing again

437
00:14:00,954 --> 00:14:03,233
as the fixes introduced new things to be fixed.

438
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:06,119
Oh, and updating as the facts themselves changed.

439
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,324
So, I can't believe YouTube won't let me

440
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:11,061
replace a video with an updated version, but also

441
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:12,130
[whispering]
please don't ever let me, YouTube,

442
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,501
[whispering]
I only have a career because you force me to move on.

443
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:17,404
Now, there is additionally a general opportunity cost

444
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:20,107
of going backward instead of making something new,

445
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:22,021
separate from the specifics of YouTube.

446
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:23,804
So how to decide, in general,

447
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:26,690
when the mountain of backwards costs is worth ascending?

448
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,073
To discuss, let's visit...

449
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:29,999
The Menagerie of Mistakes

450
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,913
For example,

451
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:33,170
in the video about Northern Ireland's lack of flag,

452
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:34,799
Scotland has three arms.

453
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,239
This is a glitch.

454
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,849
Glitches are harmless (if annoying) creatures.

455
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,221
Well, annoying to creators.

456
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:42,376
For audiences, they are fun and easy to catch.

457
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:44,427
Which is why within seconds of posting a video,

458
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:46,999
"Scotland has three arms" will be the top comment.

459
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,999
Glitches get in because, for the creator,

460
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,690
glitches are really good at hiding in plain sight,

461
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,587
surviving revision after revision.

462
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,484
And if you do spot them and try to fix them in a rush,

463
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:58,656
you often just cause their multiplication.

464
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,919
It's best to realize glitches will always be with you,

465
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,856
and accept their companionship as part of the process.

466
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,427
Next over, we have blunders.

467
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:07,210
Blunders make you look like a fool,

468
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:09,364
but still in a mostly harmless way.

469
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,416
I've only ever once before re-uploaded a video,

470
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,233
and it was "Holland vs The Netherlands"

471
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,473
because of a blunder everyone caught minutes

472
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,576
after publication and I couldn't live with.

473
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:20,267
I'd swapped flags of France and the Netherlands at one spot.

474
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:21,839
That's wrong and embarrassing,

475
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,707
but had it not been caught instantly,

476
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,319
I probably would have to had to learn to leave it be.

477
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,319
In the same way, I blundered this name,

478
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,684
pronouncing it Kur-a-ko (Kʊərækoʊ),

479
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:33,667
demonstrating exactly how familiar I was with the place or the alcohol.

480
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:34,850
When you're feeling amazing

481
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,187
about a thing that you've made,

482
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:39,187
it really tempts delighting a blunder to steal your thunder.

483
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,524
Next are errors.

484
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:43,416
Ugly, charmless things without redeeming value

485
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,290
that come in many different species.

486
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,730
From Error Trivialius,

487
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:47,513
Bad Takeus,

488
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,787
Technically Correctus,

489
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,016
Error Factualius,

490
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,724
and many, many others.

491
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,547
Their variety make it impossible to talk

492
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,336
about management in general because,

493
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:56,604
unlike glitches and blunders,

494
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:58,233
which look the same to everyone,

495
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,467
errors come from the "What is True?" dimension,

496
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:02,393
which means different humans will perceive

497
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,307
their size and importance and species in different ways.

498
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:07,844
Or disagree about if there's an error at all.

499
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,336
But, if you make things, there will be errors.

500
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,016
And post publication, deciding what to do about them

501
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:14,964
will have to take into account the size

502
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:17,130
and species you perceive and the cost

503
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:19,456
of extracting its disgusting tentacles

504
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:20,610
from what you have made.

505
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:23,467
Versus the benefits of accepting that you can't always

506
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:26,227
get them all and moving onward to make a new thing.

507
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:27,089
But.

508
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,187
When errors grow large enough, they become a new subspecies:

509
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,187
The Error Cataestrofagus

510
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:35,187
An error that fundamentally breaks

511
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:37,187
at least part of what you have made.

512
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:41,536
And, in making a straight-factual video called "What is Tekoi?"

513
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:44,061
(a video that was, at the time of publication,

514
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:46,061
the only generally accessible summary

515
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:48,347
of information about this location)

516
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:51,021
Getting which type of missile they tested wrong

517
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:53,776
is a catastrophic factual error.

518
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:55,776
Which I why I decided to fix it.

519
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:56,867
Part four.

520
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:58,330
There were no other parts.

521
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,107
But this is finally the end.

522
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:01,833
My dad always said to me,

523
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,890
"The cost of perfection is infinite."

524
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,695
And he was totally right.

525
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:07,267
I can't promise perfection,

526
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:08,568
but post-autopsy,

527
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,329
me and the team are not only working on future videos

528
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,861
with this experience in mind,

529
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:14,536
but also working on the process

530
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:15,621
that makes the videos,

531
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:17,919
and if we need to make that process longer

532
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,193
to bring videos closer to perfection,

533
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:20,804
we will.

534
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:23,947
Without a doubt, Future-Me will watch this video and wonder,

535
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:26,816
"Why, oh why, did Past-Grey have so many words

536
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:29,033
in this script to convey the simple message.

537
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:32,244
I was wrong, I apologize, I've fixed it."

538
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:34,759
But Future-Grey isn't Current-Grey,

539
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,124
and as Pascal famously quipped,

540
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,033
"If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter."

541
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:42,576
The old Tekoi video is now unlisted

542
