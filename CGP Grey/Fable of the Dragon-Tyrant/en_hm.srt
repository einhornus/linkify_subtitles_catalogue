1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,439
Once upon a time, a dragon tyrannized the kingdom.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,599
Covered with thick black scales, its eyes glowed with hate ,…

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,559
… and from its terrible jaws flowed evil-smelling slime.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,659
Some tried to fight the dragon …

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,599
… priests and magicians called down curses to no avail.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,619
Warriors, armed with the best weapons, attacked, only to be incinerated.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,979
The dragon’s claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, …

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,659
… its scaly armor so hard, as to make it invincible.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,059
The dragon demanded from humankind a tribute: …

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,499
… ten thousand men and women, randomly chosen, …

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,579
… to be delivered every evening to the foot of the mountain to be eaten.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,299
The king and the kingdom, their weapons useless, …

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,759
… had no choice but to pay the grisly tribute, ….

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,959
… to suffer the misery, to feed the insatiable hunger.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,839
And humans, ever adaptable, came to accept the dragon-tyrant as a fact of life; …

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,879
… knowing, even embracing, that everyone’s final moments would be in its maw.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,639
How could the world be otherwise?

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,799
The kingdom began to teach its children that the dragon had its place …

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,879
… in the natural order and, the very meaning of being human to end up …

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,399
… in the dragon’s stomach, their shorter lives motivating them to lead good lives.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,719
And the dragon was helping the kingdom by keeping the population …

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,919
… from growing too fast.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,519
Learning this, attacks on the dragon ceased.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,679
But the kingdom still grew, slowly, and with it so did the dragon, …

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,639
… becoming as big as the mountain on which it lived, its appetite increasing.

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,239
The logistics of collecting and transporting so many every day…

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,239
… to the mountain came to occupy the king’s mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,439
The king had to hire registrars to keep track of who would be sent.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,279
There were people-collectors dispatched to fetch the designated victims.

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,719
There were clerks who administered the pensions to be paid to decimated families.

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,559
And there were comforters who would travel with the doomed …

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,039
… on their way to the dragon, trying to ease the anguish.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,759
And there were dragonologists who studied how these logistic processes could be made more efficient.

34
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,599
Steam engines were invented and a railway constructed leading to the dragon’s abode.

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,879
Trains arrived at the mountain terminal crammed with people and return empty.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,119
Some dragonologists also studied the dragon’s behavior and collected samples …

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,719
… its shed scales, the slime, the excrement speckled with fragments of human bone.

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,439
The more the beast was understood, the more its invincibility confirmed.

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,919
But. . . humanity is a curious species.

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,959
Every once in a while, someone gets a good idea.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,079
Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements.

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,199
Some of these tools make it easier to generate new ideas.

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,439
Thus, the great wheel of invention, …

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,719
… which in the older ages turned imperceptibly slow, …

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,039
… began to accelerate and humans did what would have seemed magic before, …

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,479
… communicating instantly across great distance, building machines that could fly,

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,159
… and many other astonishing things.

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,599
A few dragonologists argued it might be time argued for a new attack …

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,799
… one had invented a material so sharp it could pierce a dragon’s scale.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,159
It would not be easy but if a huge projectile could be made out of this material …

52
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,759
… and launched with sufficient force and sufficient precision it might penetrate the dragon’s armor.

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,919
However, it would be difficult and expensive and time-consuming to do.

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,279
The dragonologists explained their proposal to anyone who would listen.

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:09,359
But the people were skeptical; they had been taught the dragon-tyrant was invincible and the sacrifices it demanded a fact of life.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,239
Yet when they learnt about the new material and the idea for a projectile, many became intrigued.

57
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,958
When the king read about the plans, he decided to hold an open hearing …

58
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,319
… it took place on the last and darkest day of the year, in the largest hall of the royal castle.

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,359
People packed in to every last seat and crowded the aisles.

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,439
The king's advisor spoke first: telling the people it was best they accept the inevitability of the dragon…

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,319
… and the dragon-administration department provided many jobs …

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,039
… that would be lost were the dragon slaughtered and, in any case, …

63
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,519
… the kingdom's coffers were empty after building the new railway.

64
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,039
Next the leading dragonologist explained how the proposed device would work, …

65
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,399
… how the requisite amount of new invented material could be manufactured.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,599
Given the requested amount of funding, it may be possible to complete the work in fifteen to twenty years.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,839
With greater funding, maybe twelve.  However, there could be no guarantee.

68
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,719
Last to speak was the king’s advisor for morality:

69
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:25,199
"Let us grant" he said "The project is technologically possible, though it hasn’t been proven to me.  …

70
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,479
… Presumably, you think you've got the right not to be chewed up.

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:37,759
How willful, how presumptuous, how vain.  The shortness of human life is a blessing.

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,559
Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our dignity.

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,879
This preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realizing more fully …

74
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,359
… the aspirations to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive.

75
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,239
The nature of the dragon is to eat, and our own nature, my friends, is nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten.

76
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
The dragon is necessary.  The dragon is good."

77
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,759
The great hall was silent.

78
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,639
Then a small child yelled out from the audience: "The dragon is bad!"

79
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,159
The child’s parents turned red and hushed, but the child said again:

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,559
"The dragon is bad -- it kills people... it ate my Granny... I want my Granny back."

81
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,639
The hall was silent again -- then a woman stood: “The dragon killed my parents.”

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,399
And man followed and stood: “The dragon killed my wife and my daughter.”

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:50,199
More and more people stood -- the simple fact that the dragon killed everyone, the loss of it, the weight of it, crashing over the hall.

84
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,879
The way out from under remote, yet maybe possible.

85
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,439
The king, looking at the first child to speak, announced: "Let us kill the dragon".

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:10,959
The next morning, a billion people woke to realize they or those they loved might be sent to the dragon before the projectile launched.

87
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,759
Whereas before, active support for the anti-dragon cause had been limited, …

88
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,879
… it now became the number one priority and concern on everyone’s mind.

89
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,319
Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase support, …

90
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,239
… which he did, passing extra appropriations bills and selling his summer castle, announcing:

91
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,119
"I believe that this kingdom should commit itself to achieving the goal, …

92
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,479
… before the decade is out, of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon."

93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,279
Thus started a great technological race against time.

94
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,079
To make the dragon-killing weapon required solutions to a thousand technical problems, …

95
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,199
… each of which required dozens of time-consuming steps and missteps.

96
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,519
Test-missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction.

97
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
Terrible accidents happened.

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,999
But there was now a seriousness of purpose, and the work continued.

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,999
But despite almost unlimited funding and round-the-clock work by technicians, the king’s deadline could not be met.

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,039
The task was hard.

101
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,279
The decade concluded and the dragon still lived — still ate.

102
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,599
But the effort was getting closer.

103
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,359
A year later the first prototype missile successfully launched.

104
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,798
The construction of the final projectile eventually set to complete and launch on New Year’s Eve, …

105
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,879
… twelve years after the project’s inauguration.

106
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:47,079
The last day of the year was cold and overcast, but still and clear — good launch conditions.

107
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,999
As the sun set, technicians scuttled around making the final adjustments and checks.

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,679
The king and his advisors observed from a platform close to the launch pad.

109
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,679
Further away, behind a fence, the public assembled to witness the great event.

110
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,799
A large clock counted down: ten minutes to go -- the dark slumped profile of the dragon beyond, eating.

111
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,719
From the crowd, someone jumped the fence and ran to the platform where the king sat.

112
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,279
He arrived, accompanied by security, in a frenzied state, his nose bleeding.

113
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,639
He shouted: "The last train! Stop the last train!"

114
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,519
The young man was a junior clerk in the ministry of transportation.

115
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,919
He had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain.

116
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,159
The king had ordered the trains to continue to the very end, …

117
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,399
… fearing any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and the missile to miss.

118
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,119
The young man begged the king to issue a recall-order for the last train, …

119
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,359
… due to arrive at the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.

120
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,079
"I cannot do it," said the king, "I cannot take the risk it will alert the dragon“.

121
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,359
The clouds above their head let loose the rain.

122
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:10,279
“I am so sorry” The king continued, “had we started but one day earlier your father would not have to die.”

123
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:17,479
Looking at the crowd, thinking of all the losses that they and he, had endured.

124
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,719
“This project should have been started years earlier than we did.

125
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:31,039
So many need not have been killed by the dragon, had we but awoken from our acceptance of its horror sooner.”

126
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,239
The young man's wailing ceased.

127
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,239
The king looked up at the countdown clock: five seconds remaining.

128
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,679
Four.

129
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,919
Three.

130
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,239
Two.

131
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,599
One.

132
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,319
Zero.

133
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,759
A ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out.

134
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,199
The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old…

135
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,159
... that white flame, shooting into the dark embodied the human spirit, its fear and its hope.

136
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,119
It struck the heart of evil.

137
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,279
The silhouette on the horizon tumbled and fell.

138
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:15,599
Thousands of voices of joy rose from the masses, joined seconds later by a deafening drawn-out thud from the collapsing monster.

139
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,959
After all this time, humanity was at last free from the dragon.

140
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,439
The joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant:

141
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,679
"Long live the king! Long live us all!"

142
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,479
The royal entourage, huddling in the downpour, accumulated around their monarch.

143
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,239
So much had changed in the last hour.

144
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:45,719
The right to an open future had been regained, a primordial fear abolished, and many long-held assumptions overturned.

145
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,319
“What do we do now?" they asked.

146
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,639
"We have come a long way. . ." said the king, "yet now we are like children again.

147
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,119
The future lies open before us.

148
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,479
We shall go and try to do better than we have done in the past, for we have time now…

149
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,799
… time to get things right, time to grow up, time to learn from our mistakes.

150
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,279
Let all the bells in the kingdom ring until midnight, in remembrance of our dead.

151
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:22,920
Then after, we will celebrate and begin the process of building a better world. . . for we have time now.
