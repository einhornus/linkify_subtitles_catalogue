1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,969
Every year some countries move their clocks
forward in the spring only to move them back

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,969
in the autumn.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,649
To the vast majority of the world who doesn’t
participate in this odd clock fiddling – it

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,499
seems a baffling thing to do.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,838
So what’s the reason behind it?

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,229
The original idea, proposed by George Hudson,
was to give people more sunlight in the summer.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,219
Of course, it’s important to note that changing
a clock doesn’t actually make more sunlight

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,979
– that’s not how physics works.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,889
But, by moving the clocks forward an hour,
compared to all other human activity, the

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,438
sun will seem to both rise and set later.

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,429
The time when the clocks are moved forward
is called Daylight Saving Time and the rest

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,738
of the year is called Standard Time.

13
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,189
This switch effectively gives people more
time to enjoy the sunshine and nice summer

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,578
weather after work.

15
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,398
Hudson, in particular, wanted more sunlight
so he could spend more time adding to his

16
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,949
insect collection.

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,109
When winter is coming the clocks move back,
presumably because people won’t want to

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,238
go outside anymore.

19
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:51,898
But, winter doesn’t have this affect on
everyone.

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,219
If you live in a tropical place like Hawaii,
you don’t really have to worry about seasons

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,288
because they pretty much don’t happen.

22
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:01,268
Every day, all year is sunny and beautiful
so christmas is just as good of a day to hit

23
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,569
the beach as any other.

24
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,689
As so, Hawaii is one of two states in the
Union that ignore daylight saving time.

25
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,469
But, the further you travel from the equator
in either direction the more the seasons assert

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,669
themselves and you get colder and darker winters,
making summer time much more valuable to the

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,669
locals.

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,909
So it’s no surprise that the further a country
is from the equator the more likely it uses

29
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,519
daylight saving time.

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,299
Hudson proposed his idea in Wellington in
1895 – but it wasn’t well received and

31
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,279
it took until 1916 for Germany to be the first
country to put it into practice.

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,909
Though, the uber-industrious Germans were
less concerned with catching butterflies on

33
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,859
a fine summer evening than they were with
saving coal to feed the war machine.

34
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,399
The Germans thought daylight saving time would
conserve energy.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,829
The reasoning goes that it encourages people
to say out later in the summer and thus use

36
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,449
less artificial lighting.

37
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,929
This sounds logical, and it may have worked
back in the more regimented society of a hundred

38
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,859
years ago, but does it still work in the modern
world?

39
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,429
That turns out to be a surprisingly difficult
question to answer.

40
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,259
For example, take mankind’s greatest invention:
AIR CONDITIONING.

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,969
The magic box of cool that makes otherwise
uninhabitable sections of the world quite

42
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,349
tolerable places to live.

43
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,249
But, pumping heat out of your house isn’t
cheap and turning on one air conditioner is

44
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,479
the same as running dozens of tungsten light
bulbs.

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,639
If people get more sunshine, but don’t use
it to go outside then Daylight Saving Time

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,979
might actually cost electricity, not save
it.

47
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,119
This is particularly true in a place like
Phoenix: where the average summer high is

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,539
107 degrees and the record is 122.

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,349
If you suggest to an Arizonian to change their
clocks in the summer to get more sunshine,

50
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,469
they laugh in your face.

51
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,109
More sun and higher electricity bills are
not what they want which is why Arizona is

52
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,879
the second state that never changes their
clocks.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,199
Another problem when trying to study daylight
saving time is rapid changes in technology

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,379
and electrical use.

55
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,409
And as technology gets better and better and
better more electricity is dedicated to things

56
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,409
that aren’t light bulbs.

57
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,799
And the lure of a hot, sweaty, mosquito-filled
day outside is less appealing than technological

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,899
entertainments and climate-controlled comfort
inside.

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,509
Also the horrifically energy in-efficient
tungsten light bulbs that have remained unchanged

60
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,789
for a century are giving way to CFLs and LEDs
– greatly reducing the amount of energy

61
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,279
required to light a room.

62
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,401
So, even assuming that DST is effective, it’s
probably less effective with every with every

63
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:03,479
passing year.

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,399
The bottom line is while some studies say
DST costs more electricity and others say

65
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,790
it saves electricity, the one thing they agree
on is the effect size: not 20% or 10% but

66
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,249
1% or less, which, in the United States, works
out to be about $4 per household.

67
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,369
$4 saved or spent on electricity over an entire
year is not really a huge deal either way.

68
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,829
So the question now becomes is the hassle
of switching the clocks twice a year worth

69
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,829
it?

70
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,109
The most obvious trouble comes from sleep
depravation – an already common problem

71
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,479
in the western world that DST makes measurably
worse.

72
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,639
With time-tracking software we can actually
see that people are less productive the week

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,129
after the clock changes.

74
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,829
This comes with huge associated costs.

75
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,529
To make things worse, most countries take
away that hour of sleep on a Monday morning.

76
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,779
Sleep depravation can lead to heart attacks
and suicides and the Daylight Saving Time

77
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,689
Monday has a higher than normal spike in both.

78
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,999
Other troubles come from scheduling meetings
across time zones.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,488
Let’s say that your trying to plan a three-way
conference between New York, London and Sydney

80
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,949
– not an easy thing to do under the best
of circumstances but made extra difficult

81
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,169
when they don’t agree on when daylight saving
time should start and end.

82
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,129
In the spring, Sydney is 11 hours ahead of
London and New York is five hours behind.

83
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,579
But then New York is the first to enter Daylight
Saving Time and moves its clock forward an

84
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,579
hour.

85
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,459
Two weeks later London does the same.

86
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,999
In one more week, Sydney, being on the opposite
side of the world, leaves daylight saving

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,268
time and moves its clock back an hour.

88
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,789
So in the space of three weeks New York is
five hours behind London, then four hours

89
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,939
and then five hours again.

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,949
And Sydney is either 11, 10 or 9 nine hours
from London and 16, 15 or 14 hours from New

91
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,949
York.

92
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,049
And this whole crazy thing happens again in
reverse six months later.

93
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,179
Back in the dark ages, this might not have
mattered so much but in the modern, interconnected

94
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,269
world planning international meetings happens
1,000s and 1,000s of times daily – shifting

95
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,019
and inconsistent time zones isn’t doing
netizens any favors.

96
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,989
And, to make matters worse, countries aren’t
even consistent about daylight saving time

97
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,099
within their own borders.

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,168
Brazil has daylight saving time, but only
if you live in the south.

99
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,429
Canada has it too, but not Saskatchewan.

100
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,689
Most of Oz does DST, but not Western Australia,
The Northern Territory or Queensland.

101
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,259
And, of course, the United States does have
DST, unless you live in Puerto Rico, the Virgin

102
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,829
Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern
Marianas Islands or, as mentioned before Hawaii

103
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,829
and Arizona.

104
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,689
But Arizona isn’t even consistent within
itself.

105
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,529
While Arizona ignores DST, the Navaho Nation
inside of Arizona follows it.

106
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,899
Inside of the Navaho Nation is the Hopi Reservation
which, like Arizona, ignores daylight saving

107
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,899
time.

108
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,709
Going deeper, inside of the Hopi Reservation
is another part of the Navaho Nation which

109
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,979
does follow daylight saving time.

110
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,979
And finally there is also part of the Hopi
Reservation elsewhere in the Navaho Nation

111
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,229
which doesn’t.

112
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,229
So driving across this hundred-mile stretch
would technically necessitate seven clock

113
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,329
changes which is insane.

114
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,948
While this is an unusual local oddity here
is a map showing the different daylight saving

115
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,918
and time zone rules in all their complicated
glory – it’s a huge mess and constantly

116
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,299
needs updating as countries change their laws.

117
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,199
Which is why it shouldn’t be surprising
that even our digital gadgets can’t keep

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,679
the time straight occasionally.

119
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,239
So to review: daylight saving time gives more
sunlight in the summer after work, which,

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,198
depending on where you live might be an advantage
– or not.

121
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,119
And it may (or may not) save electricity but
one thing is for sure, it’s guaranteed to

122
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,839
make something that should be simple, keeping
track of time, quite complicated – which

123
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,679
is why when it comes time to change the clocks
is always a debate about whether or not we

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:09,699
should.�
