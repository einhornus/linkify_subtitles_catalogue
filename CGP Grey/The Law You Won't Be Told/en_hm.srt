1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,039
On a Jury you know your options: guilty, or
not. But there's another choice that neither

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,548
the judge nor the lawyers will tell you -- often
because they're not allowed to and also it

3
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:10,428
might better if you don't know.

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:14,018
This video will tell you that third choice,
but be warned: simply watching may prevent

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,079
you from ever serving on a jury -- so this
is your last chance to hit the pause button

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,609
before you learn about...

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,739
Jury nullification: when the defendant is
100% beyond-a-reasonable-doubt guilty but

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,959
the jurors also think he shouldn't be punished.
The jury can nullify the law and let him go free.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,049
But before your on your next jury and yell
'Null! Booya!' at the judge you should know

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,859
that just talking about jury nullification
in the wrong circumstances can get you arrested.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,229
Though a video such as this one, simply acknowledging
the existence of jury nullification and

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,988
in no way advocating it is totally OK. 
And, while we're at it:

13
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,108
(CGP Grey is not a lawyer, this is not legal advice,
it is meant for entertainment purposes only.

14
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,808
Seriously, guy, don't do anything in a court of law
based on what an Internet Video told you. No joke.)

15
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:57,339
So why can't you do this? It's because nullification
isn't in the law , but exists as a logical

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,238
consequence of two other laws:

17
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,819
First: that juries can't be punished for a
wrong decision -- no matter the witnesses,

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,939
DNA evidence or video proof show. 
That's the point of a jury: to be the decider.

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,219
and, Second: when a defendant is found not-guilty,
that defendant can't be tried again for the same crime.

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,609
So there are only two stated options: guilty
or not, it's just that jury nullification

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,249
is when the words of the jurors don't match
their thoughts -- for which they can't be

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,319
punished and their not-guilty decision can't
be changed.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,419
These laws are necessary for juries to exist
within a fair system, but the logical consequence

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,859
is... contentious -- lawyers and judges argue
about jury nullification like physicists argue

25
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,839
about quantum mechanics. Both are difficult
to observe and the interpretation of both

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,949
has a huge philosophical ramification for
the subject as a whole.

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,978
Is nullification the righteous will of the
people or an anarchy of twelve or just how

28
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,709
citizens judge their laws?

29
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,899
The go-to example in favor of nullification
is the fugitive slave law: when Northern juries

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,329
refused to convict escaped slaves and set
them free.

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,349
Can't argue with that.

32
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,119
But the anarchy side is Southern juries refusing
to convict lynch mobs. Not humanity

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,219
at its best.

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,449
But both of these are juries nullifying the law.

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,669
Also juries have two options where their
thoughts may differ from their words. Jury

36
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,369
nullification usually refers to the non-guilty
version but juries can convict without evidence

37
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,999
just as easily as they can acquit in spite
of it.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,979
This is jury nullification too and the jurors
are protected by the first rule, though the

39
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,189
second doesn't apply and judges have the power
to overrule a guilty verdict if they think

40
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,529
the jurors areâ€¦ nt the best. And, of course,
a guilty defendant can appeal, at least for

41
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,119
a little while. Which makes the guilty form
of jury nullification weaker than the not-guilty

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,509
kind. Cold comfort, though.

43
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,229
Given the possibility of jurors who might
ignore the law as written, it's not surprising

44
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,419
when picking jurors for a trial, lawyers -- whose
existence is dependent on an orderly society

45
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,809
-- will ask about nullification, usually in
the slightly roundabout way:

46
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,568
"Do you have any beliefs that might prevent
you from making a decision based strictly

47
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:48,329
on the law?"

48
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,238
If after learning about jury nullification
you think it's a good idea: answer 'yes' and

49
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,249
you'll be rejected, but answer 'no' with the
intent to get on the jury to nullify and you've

50
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,818
just committed perjury -- technically a federal
crime -- which makes the optimal strategy

51
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,708
once on a jury to zip it.

52
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:07,029
But This introduces a problem for jurors who
intend to nullify: telling the other 11 angry

53
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,018
men about your position is risky, which makes
nullification as a tool for fixing unjust

54
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,649
laws nation wide problematic.

55
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,628
(Not to mention about 95% of criminal charges
in the United States never make it to trial

56
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:20,878
and rather end in a plea bargain, but that's
a story for another time.)

57
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,628
The only question about jury nullification
that may matter is if jurors should be told

58
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,449
about it and the courts are near universal
in their decision: 'no way'.

59
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,408
Which, again, might seem self-interested -- 
courts depend on the law -- but there's evidence

60
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,579
that telling jurors about nullification changes
the way they vote by making evidence less

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,348
relevant -- which isn't surprising: that's
what nullification is. But mock trials also

62
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,059
show sympathetic defendants get more non-guilty
verdicts and unsympathetic defendants get

63
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,869
more guilty verdicts in front of jurors
who were explicitly told about nullification

64
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,309
compared to those who weren't.

65
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,408
Which sounds bad, but it also isn't difficult
to imagine situations where jurors blindly

66
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:57,079
following the law would be terribly unjust
-- which is the heart of nullification: juries

67
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,238
judge the law, not solely evidence.

68
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,399
In the end righteous will of the people, or
anarchy, or citizen lawmaking -- the system

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,908
leaves you to decide -- but as long as courts
are fair they require these rules, so jury

70
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:13,909
nullification will always be with us.
