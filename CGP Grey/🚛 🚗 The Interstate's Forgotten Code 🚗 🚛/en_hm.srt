1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,469
The interstate highway shields hide within them

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,139
long forgotten knowledge. 

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,009
As our great ancestors could navigate by the signs in the sky

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,809
before the creation of the compass,

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,189
so too before GPS could they navigate by these signs.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,339
Come with me and learn how to navigate the constellations

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,979
created across a continent by the

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,589
First, are the Interstate Majors beginning with

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,499
I-90 from Seattle to Boston the longest and northern-ist of all the I's.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,749
Then the southern-ist Jacksonville, Florida, to Santa Monica, California: I-10.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,299
Interstate Majors that run east-west are double digits ending in zero.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,519
The bigger the northern-er. 

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,789
So filling in the rest, the next northern-est is San Francisco, California, to Teaneck, New Jersey: I-80.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,129
And the next southern-est Florence, South Carolina, to Kent, Texas: I-20.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,859
Then Cove Fort, Utah, to Baltimore, Maryland: I-70,

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,529
and Little Rock, Arkansas, to Fort Worth, Texas: I-30.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,149
Okay, so that one is the most minor of the Majors,

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,959
and it doesn't quite fit as well with the rest with its diagonality.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,339
But I'm confident it’s the lone exception and not foreshadowing.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,519
Next Barstow, California, to Wilmington, North Carolina: I-40.

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,499
Then, I-50 and I-60, which don't exist.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,579
See, there are older highways than the Interstate System,

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,999
slower other ways, not built to the Interstate's Book of Exalted Construction Codes.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,349
These are called US Highways or US Routes,

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,029
the most famous of which is Route 66.

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,819
And these use the United States Numbered Highway System

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,999
which put the old US Route 50 and 60 right in the middle.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,669
The Department of Transportation knew that only the most devout roadway anoraks

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,229
would be attune to the difference between Interstates and Routes,

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,059
and normals would simply look at the number.

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,369
To simplify everyone’s life, DOT skipped Interstates 50 and 60,

32
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,989
to avoid minds getting muddled in the middle of 'Merica.

33
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,159
That's the East-West Interstates Majors covered.

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,479
Now on to North-South.

35
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,489
The longest of which is Maine to Miami, Florida: I-95.

36
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,299
Which, like all majors, no exceptions surely,

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,029
are double digits, but ending in five now to indicate verticality.

38
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,809
On the opposite coast, San Diego, California, to Blaine, Washington is I-5.

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,669
Okay, so already that's not double digits,

40
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,899
but maybe officially it has a leading zero,

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,469
but just not on the sign, right, Department of Transportation?

42
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,639
No? Okay.

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,319
Well, then I-5 has a leading zero in our hearts.

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,418
The rest of the North-South Interstate Majors are

45
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,519
Petersburg, Virginia, to Montgomery, Alabama: I-85, a bit of a sister route to I-30.

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,379
San Diego, California, to Sweet Grass, Montana: I-15.

47
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,049
Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, to Hialeah, Florida: I-75.

48
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,649
Las Cruces, New Mexico, to Buffalo, Wyoming: I-25.

49
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,999
Then I-45 from Houston, Texas, to... Dallas, Texas.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,909
Contrary to popular belief, interstates don't have to be interstate interstates,

51
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,829
they can be intrastate interstates.

52
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,809
The obvious examples are Hawaii and Alaska,

53
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,649
which have intrastate interstates,

54
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,919
but also Puerto Rico which has an

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,839
I mean I guess technically it’s an

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,109
Anyway, these three, being physically disconnected from the rest of the network,

57
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,159
use a different numbering system with letters.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,339
But back on the continent, there are in fact

59
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,139
way more intrastate interstates than interstate interstates.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,249
Most are the Interstate Minors we will get to,

61
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,749
but I-45 is notable for being the only Interstate Major that's intrastate.

62
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,109
Finishing up the North-South Majors,

63
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,119
it’s Texas again, in Laredo, to Duluth, Minnesota: I-35.

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,859
Then Chicago, Illinois, to LaPlace, Louisiana: I-55.

65
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,879
And finally hop over to Mobile, Alabama, up to Gary, Indiana on I-65.

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,799
Together, the Interstate Majors constellation with its shining numbers lets you navigate the nation.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,219
The lower the numbers, the more South and West you are.

68
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,609
The higher, North and East.

69
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,949
If it ends in zero, you’re traveling horizontally.

70
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,949
And if it ends in five, vertically.

71
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,589
Very satisfying.

72
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,929
Now there are scores of lesser connecting constellations as well.

73
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,369
These are Interstate Minors

74
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,809
and use three digits to communicate their navigational secrets.

75
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,549
Interstate Minors diverge from a Major

76
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,759
and have their last two digits match the Major from whence they came.

77
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,419
Then, if the first digit is even, it means the Interstate Minor will eventually connect back to its parent Major.

78
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,919
For example, as I-70 crosses the nation,

79
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,719
I-670 diverts in Kansas City, Missouri,

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,729
but eventually circles back to connect to I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas.

81
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,029
Even-numbered Minors are often called Bypasses when they bypass something,

82
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,799
or Beltways when they encircle something.

83
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,069
An Interstate Minor that starts with an odd number

84
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,629
warns that it will not connect back to its parent.

85
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,989
This is called a Spur.

86
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,549
Example: as I-90 goes past Buffalo, I-190 diverges

87
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,299
and the odd digit lets you know you won’t be coming back.

88
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,519
Instead plunging one way into the wilds of Canada.

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,099
Nice!

90
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,398
Though sometimes a Spur won’t just go nowhere.

91
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,239
It will instead connect back to another Interstate Major.

92
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,469
In this case, which of the double digits are used as the base of the triple?

93
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,449
And the answer is... there isn't a consistent answer, it's up to the states.

94
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,179
So that's Interstate Majors and Minors,

95
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,099
but there's also Interstate Mediums.

96
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,199
Like I-64 from Wentzville, Missouri, to Chesapeake, Virginia.

97
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,589
And I-29 from Kansas City, Missouri, to Pembina, North Dakota.

98
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,199
The Interstate Mediums follow the same numbering pattern as the Majors,

99
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,009
all two digits, if we keep those leading zeros in our hearts.

100
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,259
Evens: East-West.  Odds: North-South.

101
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,069
All in order too except for I-99, which is so annoying. 

102
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,509
DOT, why did you do this?!

103
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,159
What?! Congress specifically picked 99 out of order for this highway?

104
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,609
So Congress is the only one who can fix it? 

105
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,939
Ughhhhhhhh.

106
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,509
Well, let's just try to ignore that and move on.

107
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,729
The Interstate Majors are all uniquely numbered, but not so with the Mediums.

108
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,089
There's an I-76 from Big Springs, Nebraska, to Denver, Colorado.

109
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,409
And another I-76 from Bellmar, New Jersey, to Akron, Ohio.

110
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,759
Sandwiched between the Majors I-90 and I-80,

111
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,939
are duplicate Medium I-84s, I-86s, I-87s, and I-88s.

112
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,069
The rule is that as long as the duplicates are far enough away to avoid muddling minds, it's fine.

113
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,039
There are also loads of duplicate Interstate Minors,

114
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,039
which there have to be if you think about it.

115
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,139
Take I-95 which crosses fifteen densely populated states.

116
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,069
To only have nine options for spurs and bypasses would be rather limiting.

117
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,859
In fact, just Maryland alone has an

118
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,029
I-195, 295, 395, 495, 595, 695, 795, 895, and… really?

119
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,029
Ughh, so close.

120
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,699
DOT, you've got to build an I-995 in Maryland just to complete the set for me.

121
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,789
Please!

122
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,379
So that's the system.

123
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,859
But as we've already seen with Interstate Mediums,

124
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,179
anything built over decades is going to acquire exceptions.

125
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,769
And, taking a little detour to my home interstate I-495

126
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,139
aka the Long Island Expressway
aka the L.I.E.

127
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,019
Don't dare call it "the LIE" or locals will laugh at you.

128
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,609
The is the spinal spur of the Long Island fish,

129
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,079
never connecting back to its parent I-95 because Long Island is... an island.

130
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,369
But as a one-way spur it should start with an odd digit, not an even.

131
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,409
And it really should be a two-digit Interstate Medium

132
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,079
because it technically doesn't connect to I-95 at all,

133
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,119
rather just dropping you off in midtown Manhattan, with an

134
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,119
I guess the L.I.E. is a lie after all.

135
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,349
A worse exception on the other coast in San Francisco is Interstate 238.

136
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,309
Which the number tells you should be a bypass off of I-38.

137
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,339
But no, I-38 doesn't exist.

138
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,709
I-238 is a one-way spur connecting two other Interstate Minors: I-580 and I-880.

139
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,969
So, I don’t even know what’s going on here.

140
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,819
There's also some weirdly one-off numbering such as:

141
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,869
I-35 which splits into I-35 East and I-35 West to reach Fort Worth and Dallas before re-joining,

142
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,749
and pulls the same trick up North dividing in twain East-West branches again to hit the Twin Cities.

143
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,139
Why wasn’t just one of the branches on each end

144
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,099
picked to be the bypass so that the system could be consistent?

145
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,969
Was it because the cities didn’t want to be the one considered “bypassed?”

146
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,919
Ughh. That’s totally the reason, isn’t it?

147
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,599
The weirdest one off is the nice I-69.

148
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,649
Which splits itself into I-69 East, I-69 West, and I-69C.

149
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,989
Okay, you do you, I-69.

150
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,759
At least you have a sign, unlike, back in New York,

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,869
with America's smallest Interstate 878 at just under a mile.

152
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,839
Which apparently doesn't deserve a sign.

153
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,079
So the interstate anoraks can never complete their selfie collection.

154
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,669
Okay, that's enough exceptions.

155
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,609
I could do this all day.

156
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,509
(I already cut so many from the script you wouldn't believe it.)

157
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,399
Back to the big, beautiful constructed constellation

158
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,369
and it's lost wayfinding ways, now revealed,

159
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,429
so that as your ancestors before you navigated by the sky,

160
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,249
you too can go on an American road trip

161
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,269
navigating by the interstate numbers alone.

162
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,879
[twinkling, ethereal music plays softly]

163
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,709
Well, after you memorize all the exceptions.

164
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,839
