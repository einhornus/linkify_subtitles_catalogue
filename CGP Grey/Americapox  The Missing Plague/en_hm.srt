1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,628
Between the first Europeans arriving
in 1492 and the Victorian age, the indigenous

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,979
population of the New World dropped by at
least 90%.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,839
The cause?

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,569
Not the conquistadors and company -- they killed
lots of people but their death count is nothing

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,688
compared to what they brought with them: small
pox, typhus, tuberculosis, influenza, bubonic

6
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:31,819
plague, cholera, mumps, measles and more leapt
from those first explorers to the costal tribes,

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:39,009
then onward the microscopic invaders spread
through a hemisphere of people with no defenses

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,659
against them. Tens of millions died.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:49,669
These germs decided the fate of these battles
long before the fighting started.

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,148
Now ask yourself: why didn't the Europeans get
sick?

11
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:58,538
If New-Worlders were vulnerable to old-world
diseases, then surely Old-Worlders would be

12
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,828
vulnerable to New World diseases.

13
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:07,079
Yet, there was no Americapox spreading eastward
infecting Europe and cutting the population

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,408
from 90 million to 9. Had Americapox existed
it would have rather dampened European ability

15
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,919
for transatlantic expansion.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,249
To answer why this didn't happen: we need
first to distinguish regular diseases -- like

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,989
the common cold -- from what we'll call plagues.

18
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,228
1. Spread quickly between people.

19
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:34,539
Sneezes spread plagues faster than handshakes
which are faster than closeness. Plagues

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,839
use more of this than this.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,508
2. They kill you quickly or you become immune.

22
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:46,539
Catch a plague and you're dead within seven
to thirty days; survive and you'll never get

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,898
it again. Your body has learned to fight it.
You might still carry it -- the plague lives

24
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,849
in you, you can still spread it -- but it can't
hurt you.

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,118
The surface answer to this question isn't
that Europeans had better immune systems to

26
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,019
fight off New World plagues -- it's that the New
World didn't have plagues for them to catch.

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,799
They had regular diseases but there was no
Americapox to carry.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,509
These are history's biggest killers, and they
all come from the Old World.

29
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,559
But why?

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,179
Let's dig deeper, and talk cholera: a plague
that spreads if your civilization does a bad

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,419
job of separating drinking water from pooping
water. London was terrible at this, making

32
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,359
it the cholera capital of the world. Cholera
can rip through dense neighborhoods, killing

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,909
swaths of the population before moving onward.
But that's the key: it has to move on.

34
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:52,429
In a small, isolated group, a plague like
cholera cannot survive -- it kills all available

35
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,299
victims, leaving only the immune and then
theres nowhere to go -- it's a fire that burns

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,639
through its fuel.

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,789
But a city -- shining city on the hill -- to
which rural migrants flock, where hundreds

38
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:13,238
of babies are born a day: this is sanctuary
for the fire of plague; fresh kindling comes

39
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,429
to it. The plague flares and smolders and
flares and smolders again -- impossible to

40
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,689
extinguish.

41
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,789
Historically, in city borders, plagues killed
faster than people could breed. Cities grew

42
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,339
because more people moved to them than died
inside of them. Cities only started growing

43
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,699
from their own population in the 1900s when
medicine finally left its leaches and bloodletting

44
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:44,079
phase and entered its soap and soup phase, giving humans some tools to slow death.

45
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,818
But before that a city was an unintentional
playground for plagues and a grim machine to

46
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,568
sort the immune from the rest.

47
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,708
So the deeper answer is that the New World
didn't have plagues because the New World

48
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:05,988
didn't have big, dense, terribly sanitized
deeply interconnected cities for plagues to

49
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:06,768
thrive.

50
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:13,999
OK, but The New World wasn't completely barren
of cities, and tribes weren't completely isolated.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,268
Otherwise the newly-arrived smallpox in the
1400s couldn't have spread.

52
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,059
Cities are only part of the puzzle: they're
required for plagues, but cities don't make

53
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,189
the germs that start the plagues -- those
germs come from the missing piece.

54
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,399
Now, most germs don't want to kill you, for
the same reason you don't want to burn down

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,569
your house; germs live in you. Chronic diseases
like leprosy are terrible because they're

56
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,289
very good at living in you and not killing you.

57
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:52,939
Plague lethality is an accident, a misunderstanding,
because the germs that cause them don't know

58
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,469
they're in humans; they think
they're in this.

59
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,198
Plagues come from animals.

60
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,399
Whooping cough comes from pigs, as does flu,
as well as from birds. Our friend the cow

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,129
alone is responsible for measles, tuberculosis,
and smallpox.

62
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,249
For the cow these diseases are no big deal
-- like colds for us. But when cow germs get

63
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,069
in humans, the things they do to make a
cow a little sick to spread make humans very sick.

64
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,249
Deadly sick.

65
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,969
Now, germs jumping species like this is extraordinarily
rare. That's why generations of humans can

66
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,439
spend time around animals just fine. Being
the patient zero of a new animal-to-human

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,959
plague is winning a terrible lottery.

68
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,929
But a colonial-age city raises the odds: there
used to be animals everywhere; horses, herds

69
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,629
of livestock in the streets, open slaughterhouses,
meat markets pre-refrigeration, and rivers

70
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,589
of human and animal excrement running
through it all.

71
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,329
A more perfect environment for diseases to
jump species could hardly be imagined.

72
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,059
So the deeper answer is that plagues come
from animals, but so rarely that you have to raise

73
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:13,339
the odds with many chances for infection
and even then the new-born plague needs a fertile environment

74
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,499
to grow. The Old World had the necessary pieces
in abundance.

75
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,818
But why was a city like London filled with
sheep and pigs and cows and Tenochtitlan wasn't?

76
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:30,249
This brings us to the final level, for this
video anyway.

77
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,329
Some animals can be put to human use -- this
is what domestication means: animals you can

78
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,799
breed, not just hunt.

79
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,899
Forget for a the moment the modern world: go back
to 10,000BC when tribes of humans reached

80
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,329
just about everywhere. If you were in one
of these tribes, what local animals could you

81
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,869
capture, alive, and successfully pen to breed?

82
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,598
Maybe you're in North Dakota and thinking
about catching a Buffalo: an unpredictable,

83
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:04,138
violent tank on hooves, that can outrun you
across the planes, leap over your head and

84
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,758
travels in herds thousands strong.

85
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:13,189
Oh, and you have no horses to help you -- because
there are no horses on the continent. Horses

86
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,869
live here -- and won't be brought over until
too late.

87
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,929
It's just you, a couple buddies, and stone-based
tools. American Indians didn't fail to domesticate

88
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,879
buffalo because they couldn't figure it out.
They failed because it's a buffalo. No one

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,559
could do it -- buffalo would have been amazing
creatures to put to human work back in BC,

90
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,809
but it's not going to happen -- humans have
only barely domesticated buffalo with all

91
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,209
our modern tools.

92
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,839
The New World didn't have good animal candidates
for domestication. Almost everything big enough

93
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,019
to be useful is also too dangerous,
or too agile.

94
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,378
Meanwhile the fertile crescent to central
Europe had cows and pigs and sheep and

95
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:01,829
goats: easy-peasy animals comparatively begging
to be domesticated.

96
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,628
A wild boar is something to contend with if
you only have stone tools but it's possible

97
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:13,909
to catch and pen and breed and feed to eat
-- because pigs can't leap to the sky or crush

98
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,209
all resistance beneath their hooves.

99
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:22,668
In the New World the only native domestication
contestant was: llamas. They're better than

100
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,029
nothing -- which is probably why the biggest
cities existed in South America -- but they're

101
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:33,298
no cow. Ever try to manage a heard of llamas
in the mountains of Peru? Yeah, you can do

102
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,098
it, but it's not fun. Nothing but drama, these
llamas.

103
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,158
These might seem, cherry-picked examples,
because aren't there hundreds of thousands

104
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,268
of species of animals? Yes, but when you're
stuck at the bottom of the tech tree, almost

105
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:53,018
none of them can be domesticated. From the
dawn of man until this fateful meeting, humans

106
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:59,569
domesticated; maybe a baker's dozen of unique
species the world over. And even to get that

107
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,289
high a number you need to stretch it to include
honeybees and silkworms; nice to have, but

108
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,189
you can't build a civilization on a foundation
of honey alone.

109
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:16,949
These early tribes weren't smarter, or better
at domestication. The Old World had more valuable

110
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,699
and easy animals. With dogs, herding sheep
and cattle is easier. Now humans have a buddy

111
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,609
to keep an eye on the clothing factory, and
the milk and cheeseburger machine, and the

112
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,939
plow-puller. Now farming is easier, which
means there's more benefit to staying put,

113
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,829
which means more domestication, which means
more food which means more people and more

114
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:41,528
density and oh look where we're going. Citiesville:
population: lots; bring your animals; plagues

115
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,229
welcome.

116
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,849
That is the full answer: The lack of New World
animals to domesticate limited not only exposure

117
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,719
to germs sources but also limited food production,
which limited population growth, which limited

118
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,239
cities, which made plagues in the New World
an almost impossibility. In the Old [World], exactly

119
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,328
the reverse, and thus a continent full of
plague and a continent devoid of it.

120
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:10,469
So when ships landed in the New World, there
was no Americapox to bring back.

121
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,208
The game of civilization has nothing to do
with the players, and everything to do with

122
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:21,578
the map. Access to domesticated animals in
numbers and diversity is the key resource

123
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:28,719
to bootstrapping a complex society from nothing
-- and that complexity brings with it, unintentionally,

124
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,588
a passive biological weaponry devastating
to outsiders.

125
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:40,088
Start the game again but move the domesticable
animals across the sea and history's arrow

126
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:49,509
of disease and death flows in the opposite
direction.

127
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,898
This still does leave one last question. Just
why are some animals domesticable and others

128
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:01,778
not? Why couldn't American Indians domesticate
deer? Why can't zebras be domesticated? They

129
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:08,078
look just like horses. And what does it mean
to tame an animal? To answer that, click here

130
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,709
for part 2.
