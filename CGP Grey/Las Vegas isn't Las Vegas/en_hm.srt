1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,499
Vegas, baby!

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,709
It's Paradise.

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,779
Not metaphorically either, this literally
isn't the city of Las Vegas -- look at a map

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,138
and you'll see the name Paradise -- and when
you visit and check the weather: same thing.

5
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:16,419
Here is Las Vegas and here is Paradise which
contains *nearly everything* people associate

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,899
with Las Vegas including the sign.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,159
Now, you might think Paradise is just a relatively
unknown city mistaken for its larger neighbor,

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,709
like elsewhere, but Paradise isn't a city
at all: it's an unincorporated place.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,709
What's that?

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,669
Quick government recap: citizens living in
a city have to follow the rules of the city,

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,679
and also those of the county, and also, the
state, and also the nation.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,328
It's a government layer cake.

13
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,999
And each layer collects its own taxes to enforce
its own rules.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,999
If some folk find these layers oppressive,
they can hitch their wagons and head for open

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,679
lands outside the borders of any city -- to
live like the rugged individualists they are

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,999
-- free of rules.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,529
Well, except for those of the nation, and
also the state, and also the county -- but

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,499
moving outside a city, there's one fewer 'and
also' layer because they are in an unincorporated

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,499
place.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,489
But if they make it nice and the population
grows, inevitably people want police and sewers

21
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,709
and schools and rules.

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,749
And soon, a charter is written, a mayor elected
and a city incorporated.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,809
What makes Paradise weird is that unlike most
unincorporated places that contain mostly

24
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,188
blowing tumbleweeds and perhaps a yurt where
nobody wants to live, there are almost a quarter

25
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,508
million residents in Paradise in a space the
size of Disney World.

26
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,149
That density is *way* past the point you'd
expect people to incorporate a city.

27
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,169
And it's not like Paradiseians just couldn't
bother, Paradise is almost unique in being

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,798
*officially* unincorporated … so… why?

29
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,179
It started with the Mormons who first settled
these lands in the 1880s… actually no -- jump

30
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,898
cut to: 1950!

31
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,359
When we still tested out nuclear bombs in
the open, near population centers.

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,609
Nevada^† recently legalized gambling and
a casino empire grew in Vegas.

33
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,529
Well -- *just* outside of it to avoid city
taxes.

34
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,148
As for necessary services, the casinos were
rich enough to provide their own notably,

35
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,439
using their security forces as de facto police.

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,159
Which might not sound on the up and up, but
this was the mob running things -- and of

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,999
course they don't any more.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,239
Actually, really, they don't, it's all run
by about two companies now.^‡

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,449
Anyway, the official City of Las Vegas in
the 1950s was on the verge of bankruptcy -- and

40
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,749
with profitable casinos touching its border,
the mayor was all like, 'who are you kidding?,

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,499
this is totally part of Las Vegas because
I say so, and you're going to pay Las Vegas

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,499
taxes.'

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,499
The Casinos said 'no'.

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,689
There was a dispute that only the county,
the next level of government up, could resolve.

45
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,809
The casinos, by the way, payed taxes to the
county direct.

46
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,309
So *shockingly* the county told Vegas, *no*
you can't annex this land and tax its businesses

47
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,839
just because you want to.

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,979
And to prevent Vegas from trying anything
funny in the future the county created the

49
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,939
officially, unofficially, unincorporated place
named Paradise.^§

50
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,199
Everything that happens within it's borders,
the actual city of Las Vegas has no control

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,409
over --here the county rules and sets lower
taxes of all sorts, which is why when new

52
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,729
casinos are built, it's generally in Paradise
not Las Vegas.

53
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,009
But if all this makes you think that the origin
of Paradise was just some kind of city-sized

54
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,329
tax dodge... you're right!

55
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,649
This episode is brought to you by Audible.com--
who has over a hundred-and-eighty-thousand

56
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,199
audiobooks for you to listen to.

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,759
I listen to *a lot* of audiobooks every year,
and I use Audible to do it.

58
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,999
And I am going to recommend to you the book
that I listened to on my most recent vacation

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,399
to Las Vegas, which was “The Graveyard Book”
by Neil Gaiman.

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,529
It’s a fictional story, so I don’t really
want to give any spoilers -- let’s just

61
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,829
say that Neil Gaiman is an excellent storyteller
and he has an excellent narrating voice to

62
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,869
go along with it.

63
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,229
And he really lends personalities to all of
the characters that he creates, in the unique

64
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,469
way that only an author can.

65
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,039
If you are looking for a fun, enjoyable story;
this one gets my thumbs up!

Graveyard Book” perhaps and a 30-day trial.

audiobooks, now is the time to try it.

71

Now before you go around correcting everybody
that your vacation was in Paradise, not Las

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,499
Vegas, Las Vegas city and Paradise are both
in Las Vegas Valley, so you can say you went

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,379
to Las Vegas, while never setting foot in
Las Vegas, and still be technically correct

74
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,790
that you went to Las Vegas.
