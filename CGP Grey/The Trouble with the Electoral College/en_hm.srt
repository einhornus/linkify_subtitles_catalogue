1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,849
In a fair democracy everyone's vote should
count equally, but the method that the United

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,848
States uses to elect its president, called
the electoral college, violates this principle

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,289
by making sure that some people's votes are
more equal than others.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,369
The Electoral College is, essentially, the
538 votes that determine who wins the presidency.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,639
If these votes were split evenly across the
population every 574,000 people would be represented

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,909
by one vote.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,899
But that's not what happens because the Electoral
College doesn't give votes to people, only

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,899
states.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,569
Which has some unfair consequences.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,159
For example there are 11,500,000 people in
Ohio so, to fairly represent them, it should

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,619
get 20 electoral votes.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,219
But the Electoral college doesn't give Ohio
20 votes, it only gets 18 -- two less than

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,328
it should.

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,509
Where'd those other votes go?

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,989
To states like Rhode Island.

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,828
Plucky Rhode Island has 1.1 million people
in it, so it should have about two votes,

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,328
but instead it gets four!

18
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,939
Those extra two votes that should be representing
Ohioans go to representing Rhode Islanders

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,939
instead?

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,939
Why?

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,119
Because, according to the rules of the electoral
college, every state, no matter how few people

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,488
live there, gets three votes to start with
before the rest are distributed according

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,959
to population.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,139
Because of this rule there are a lot of states
with a few people that should only have one

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,189
or two votes for president but instead get
three or four.

26
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,149
So Georgians, Virginians, Michiganders & Jerseyites
are each missing one vote,

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,929
Pennsylvanians, North Carolinians, Ohioans
& Hoosiers are missing two, Floridians are

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,879
missing 4, New Yorkers, 5, Texans 6, and Californians
are 10 short of what they should get.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,479
Because of this vote redistribution, the Electoral
College essentially pretends that fewer people

30
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,329
live where they do and more people live where
they don't.

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,749
An American who lives in one of these states,
has their vote for president count for less

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,118
than an American who lives in one of these
states.

33
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,408
In some cases the Electoral College bends
the results just a little, but if you live

34
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,699
in a particularly large or small state, it
bends them a lot.

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,669
One Vermonter's vote, according to the Electoral
College is worth three Texans' votes.

36
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,429
And one Wyomingite's vote is worth four Californians'.

37
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,509
Now, hold on there son, you might be saying
to yourself right now: you're missing the

38
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,309
whole point of the electoral college.

39
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,049
It's to protect the small states from the
big states.

40
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,129
Give the small states more voting power and
the presidential candidates will have to pay

41
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,179
them more attention in an election.

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,618
If that's the goal of the electoral college,
it's failing spectacularly.

43
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,698
Here's a graph showing the number of visits
the presidential Candidates paid to each of

44
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,179
the states in the last two months of the previous
election.

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,988
If it looks like there are a few states missing,
you're right.

46
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,768
Only 18 of the 50 states received even a single
visit from a candidate.

47
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:22,278
And just two of those states, Mane and New
Hampshire have very small populations.

48
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:26,249
The area of the country with the most small
states is conspicuously missing.

49
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,729
The Electoral College doesn't make candidates
care about small states.

50
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,318
But, interestingly the biggest states, California,
Texas and New York are missing as well so

51
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,568
what's going on?

52
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:40,488
Looking closer, just four states, Ohio, Florida,
Pennsylvania and Virginia received a majority

53
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,998
of the candidates' attention during the election.

54
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,509
And if you follow the money, it's the same
story.

55
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,179
Why do candidates spend so much money and
time in so few states?

56
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,229
Because the way the electoral college works
forces them to do so.

57
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,968
The elections are winner-take-all.

58
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,968
As long as a candidate gets just over 50%
of the popular vote in a state he wins 100%

59
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,988
of that state's electoral votes.

60
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,558
That means winning by millions of citizens'
votes is no better than winning by a single

61
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,558
vote.

62
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:08,238
So candidates are safe to ignore states where
they poll with big margins.

63
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,089
Instead, the electoral college makes candidates
intensely interested in the needs of just

64
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,998
a few states with close races, to the detriment
of of almost all Americans, which is why it

65
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,339
should be abolished.

66
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,339
But wait!

67
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,119
You might say, won't abolishing the electoral
college and voting directly for president

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,878
cause candidates to spend all their time in
big cities?

69
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,058
That wouldn't fair to most Americans either.

70
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:31,619
This sounds like a reasonable fear, but ignores
the mathematical reality of population distribution.

71
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,098
There are 309 million people in the United
States, only 8 million of which live in New

72
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,198
York, the largest city by far.

73
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,818
That's 2.6% of the total population.

74
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,158
But after New York, the size of cities drops
fast.

75
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,388
LA has 3.8 million and Chicago has 2.7 but
you can't even make it to the tenth biggest

76
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:50,298
city, San Jose before you're under a million
people.

77
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,268
These top ten cities added together are only
7.9% of the popular vote hardly enough to

78
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,478
win an election.

79
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,468
And even winning the next 90 biggest cities
in the United States all the way down to Spokane

80
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:03,649
is still not yet 20% of the total population.

81
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,958
So unless there's a city with a few hundred
million people hiding somewhere in America

82
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,438
that's been left out of the census, the idea,
that a candidate can just spend their campaign

83
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,978
Jetting between New York, LA and Chicago while
ignoring everyone else and still become president

84
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,018
is mathematically ludicrous.

85
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,419
Want to see the real way to unfairly win?

86
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,589
How YOU can become President with only 22%
of the popular vote by taking advantage of

87
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,418
the Electoral College today!

88
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,589
Don't believe that's possible in a democracy?

89
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,589
Just watch:

90
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,258
Here's the action plan: win the votes of the
people who count the most and ignore the people

91
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,619
who count the least.

92
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,609
Start with Wyoming, the state where 0.18%
of Americans live but who get 0.56% of the

93
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,098
electoral college votes for president.

94
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:45,008
And, because it's a winner take all system,
you don't need all of them to vote for you,

95
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,429
just half plus one or 0.09%.

96
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,189
Next up is the District of Columbia where
winning 0.1% of the population also gets you

97
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,049
an additional 0.56% of the electoral college.

98
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,989
Then add in wins in Vermont, and North Dakota,
and Alaska.

99
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,309
Notice how the votes your getting to win the
presidency go up much faster than the percent

100
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,688
of the population who voted for you because
of the Electoral College's rules.

101
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:11,709
Next is South Dakota, then Delaware, Montana,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Hawaii,

102
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:17,168
Idaho, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Mexico,
Nevada, Utah, Kansas, Arkansas, Mississippi,

103
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,299
Iowa, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Oregon, Kentucky,
Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Colorado,

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,019
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maryland, Missouri,
Tennessee, Arizona, Indiana, Massachusetts,

105
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,258
Virginia, and New Jersey.

106
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,758
Congratulations, by taking advantage of unfair
rules and winning states, not people, you've

107
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,168
won a majority in the Electoral College even
though 78% of the population voted against

108
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,168
you.

109
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,378
This is not Democracy, this is indefensible.

110
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,038
While this particular scenario is unlikely,
if you have a voting system that allows losers

111
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,519
to win, you shouldn't be surprised when they
do.

112
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,079
Not once, not twice, but thrice in American
history the candidate with the most votes

113
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,818
from the people actually lost because of the
electoral college.

114
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,549
Three errors in 55+ elections is a failure
rate of 5%.

115
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,038
Would anyone tolerate a sport where, by a
quirk of the rules, there was a 5% chance

116
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,638
that the loser would win?

117
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,728
Not likely.

118
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,500
Given how much more important electing the
president of the United States is, that's

119
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,109
a rather dangerously high percentage of the
time to get it wrong.

120
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,068
If we abolish the Electoral College and simply
let citizens vote for the president directly,

121
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,550
all of these problems will go away and everyone's
vote will be equal.
