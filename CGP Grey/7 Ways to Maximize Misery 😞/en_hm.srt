1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,499
Happiness -- many will advise you how to
obtain it but maybe you're not trying to

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,779
be happy. Your actions
aim for the opposite. You want to be the

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,098
saddest saddo sailing on the sea of
sadness -- much easier to achieve and this

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,229
video has 7 tactics to get you started
toward the dark currents, at least one of

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,859
which you are already doing. So let's
begin. First, stay still. Remain indoors as

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,359
much as possible, preferably in the same
room. Be the human equivalent of a pile

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,549
of laundry -- inert, unmoving. Don't let a
beautiful day tempt you for a walk. Avoid

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,659
anything even vaguely exercisial.
This keeps reward chemicals out of your

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,049
brain which could diverge you and
stillness guides you towards medical

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,839
problems which will keep this wheel
turning. Stillness is the most effective

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,879
thing you can do, so be the laundry pile.
Make your bedroom your allroom. Live and

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,069
work and play and sleep in the smallest
radius you can. Which brings us to screw

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,448
with your sleep. The wrath of insomnia
will be your co-pilot on the sea of

14
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,279
sadness. Her mere presence is unpleasant,
but she also helps confuse the

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,429
productive part of your brain which
might look to navigate you toward the

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,199
islands of happiness on the horizon. More on that later. A regular sleep cycle is a

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,849
fragile thing and takes at least three
days to establish. Be sure then to vary

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,019
your bedtime by several hours twice a
week, at least. Even better:

19
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,938
vary your wake time. Sleep in late,
preferably very late, some but not all

20
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,478
days. And tell yourself you are making up for sleep to feel like you're doing

21
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,919
something healthy even though you feel
terrible when you wake up early and when

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,578
you wake up late. Irregular sleep is
another of the sea's accelerating

23
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,478
currents. The more you vary your sleep,
the harder regular sleep becomes, which

24
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,978
makes your sleep more variable. To never
sleep or wake at the same time naturally

25
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,258
is the goal. And to help in this, maximize
your screen time. Staying on-screen

26
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,609
complements the previous sailing tactics.
Boredom could drive you to motion, so let

27
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,809
the screen entertain you. Tiredness can
push you to sleep, so let the screen keep

28
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,019
you awake, sort of, as long as possible.
Always fall asleep with a screen in your

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,059
hand and put your eyes back on it as
soon as you wake.

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,079
Every moment away from a screen is a
moment you might notice the horizon. Keep

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,239
your head down and let the currents pull
you. Here you have allies unknown. Behind

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,779
the screen are teams of the smartest
people and brightest bots competing to

33
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,909
hold your attention on them as long as
possible. Let them reach you to pull you

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,789
back if you turn away. Plus, screens
help with number four: use your screen to

35
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,589
stoke your negative emotions, to feed
your anger or anxiety about things over

36
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,389
which you have no control or influence.
Be well informed while doing nothing. The

37
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,629
things you care about could be
navigational guides out of the sea,

38
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,889
reasons to leave your allroom and take
meaningful action with the humans around

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,299
you. But you can instead use the things
you care about as further sources of

40
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,919
misery. Focus on the bad to fuel your
resentment or despair. If you must

41
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,659
contribute, do so only in meaningless
token ways and be disappointed in the

42
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,068
lack of change. We're coming towards the
end and if you're doing it right, misery

43
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,749
is descending. But some part of your
brain is rebelling, trying to turn the

44
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,679
ship by setting a goal. If you're not
careful, that part of your brain just

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,328
might save you, but luckily we can do
more than just hobble it. We can fool it

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,548
to navigate deeper into the sea. To reach
goals, they must be specific, measurable,

47
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,078
actionable, for which you are responsible,
and time bounded. I will turn the wheel

48
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,759
one degree right now. Instead, set the
productive part of your brain on vapid

49
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,619
goals: vague, amorphous, pie-in-the-sky,
irrelevant, delayed. Make the target

50
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,809
unclear and the path unclear. If
motivation strikes, aim ridiculously high

51
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,488
to guarantee failure. I will clean the
whole house today is much better than I

52
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,539
will do the laundry in this pile.
Cleaning a whole house is impossible.

53
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,889
There's always more to do, so you will
always fail. Focus on goals that are

54
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,298
after what you wish to achieve. Learn how
to market an app before you learn to

55
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,708
code. This will distract the productive
part of your brain quite nicely. And be

56
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,268
sure to wait for motivation rather than
setting a time. You'll do something when

57
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,398
you feel like it, which will be never or
never enough to matter. With vapid goals,

58
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,668
you will turn the productive part of
your brain from a dangerous source of

59
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,658
self-improvement that rewards
every small step into a consistent nag

60
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:31,408
that berates you for your failure to
have already accomplished your goal

61
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:34,378
every step of the way.
Now the vapid goals you've set should

62
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,369
distract the productive part of your
brain, but if it still fights against you,

63
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,128
direct it towards the mirage on the sea
of sadness: the islands of happiness

64
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:49,918
themselves. Pursue happiness directly. The
human mind is such that by setting sail

65
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,568
towards happiness, you will achieve the
opposite. Imagine happiness as a place

66
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,568
where happy people are happy all the
time.

67
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:02,128
This turns happiness into an unreachable
feeling of constant bliss that no one

68
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:07,228
has. True happiness is like a bird that
might land on your ship, but never if you

69
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,698
constantly stand guard to catch it.
Instead, improve your ship and sail into

70
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,829
warmer waters -- the bird will land when
you aren't looking. Uh -- so be sure never to

71
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,269
do that. Aim toward the mirage of
happiness rather than improving the ship

72
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,589
upon which you sail. Last, but most
important, follow your instincts.

73
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,728
Navigation deeper into the sea of
sadness is quite easy, for there is a

74
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,778
dark magnetic field that points the
compass of your impulses in the right

75
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,758
direction once you get started. You will
want to stay indoors, you will want to

76
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,888
not exercise, you will want to sleep in,
you will want to do what you know will

77
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:49,348
make you sadder after you've done it.
Your compass points the way, both in and

78
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:55,019
out, so follow the true north of your
impulses and stay away from that other

79
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,359
pole of the long-term. It's all so simple.
Just get started with these tactics and

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,629
let the sea carry you along.

81
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,479
This video was produced as an adaptation
of How to Be Miserable by Dr. Randy J.

82
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,529
Patterson, which is a great example of
how thinking about the opposite of your

83
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,189
goal can help you achieve what you
really want. And if you want to listen to
