1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,939
Bouncing across a scene, tumbleweed establish the Wild West as Western.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,539
But more than just props, tumbleweed are real and tumbleweed are alive.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,019
Well, they were alive.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,719
Each tumbleweed starts as a tiny seed on the craggy landscape.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,259
Putting down roots, up branches, opening flowers,

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,749
and, through the miracle of life, birthing seeds.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,569
Itty bitty baby tumbles-to-be.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,119
Now, dropping these seeds straight down

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,619
won't give the tumble tots their best head start,

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,649
so what's a parent plant to do but sacrifice their life for their children?

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,949
To intentionally starve themselves, to die, and to dry,

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,769
to catch the wind, to shuffle off this mortal coil,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,359
to bounce across the land, to chance their children to find fertile ground,

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,219
to root, to sprout, to grow, to flower, to continue the circle of life.

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,609
It's beautiful, really.

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,079
These humble tumble rolling across the West

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,979
in search of empty land to colonize

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,739
are as iconically West as Westerners westerning.

19
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,639
Because neither are natives.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,209
Before the 1800s there were no homesteaders and no tumbleweed in the West.

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,379
Tumbleweed are an invasive species, and a deeply unwelcome one.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,919
It's time to get real about the Trouble with Tumbles.

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,169
Now, you might be thinking

24
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,659
If the West is mostly empty and tumbleweed arrived and survived...

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,259
What's the big deal?  They're kind of nice.

26
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,259
And you know what, you're right, kind of.

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,949
Tumbles are like snow, a little is charming.

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,419
But a lot is a problem.

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,689
And a lot a lot, dangerous.

30
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,979
Tumbleweed stick to things, and each other.

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,899
One stuck tumble becomes two, ten, a tumulus.

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,179
The American interior has vast swaths of land,

33
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,949
and after a tumble terrain takeover,

34
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,799
one big windstorm can drown a village under thousands of the things,

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,849
with people quickly finding their roads,

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,399
and vehicles, and even homes inaccessible.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,399
If you've never seen tumbles on the move,

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,329
or the aftermath of that, it's unreal.

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,049
And though a tumble drift looks like a brown snow drift,

40
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,999
this snow is full of thorns.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,999
If you're thinking of a rose, think again.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,519
On tumbles, it's all thorns.

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,949
Brittle to to break off in your skin, or horse-kin, where it can fester.

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,819
Clearing tumbleweed isn't just painful but also infuriating:

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,509
a tumbleweed drift is both bouncy and sticky.

46
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,889
You're going to have to fork them, one at a time.

47
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,959
Tedious at best.  Sisyphean at worst.

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,659
You might want to use industrial equipment, but be careful.

49
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,659
Tumbleweed are shockingly flammable.

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,069
Dry and airy but still branch dense they are min-maxed kindling.

51
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,439
A tumbleweed will go up in flames way fast and burns way hot.

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,339
More on that later.

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,209
But even if you manage to clear the town

54
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,449
and all the open land around the town,

55
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,929
a single missed seed contains the next tumble torrent.

56
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,489
For while many plants use flowers to attract bees

57
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,469
to cross-pollinate and reproduce, not tumbles.

58
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,539
Their flowers have nothing for bees.

59
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,819
Instead exploding pollen directly into the wind

60
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,999
(hope you don't have allergies)

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,049
to cross pollinate.

62
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,299
And tumbles don't need two to tango.  A lone tumbleweed can fu-pollinate itself.

63
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,249
So that single missed seed will grow up to be a tumblin' weed

64
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,699
containing tens of thousands of seeds,

65
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,199
hundreds of thousands if it gets large enough.

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,249
A single tumble tumbling to town one year

67
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,409
leaves a tumble trail the next,

68
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,709
and an exponential explosion thereafter.

69
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,159
And then there's the danger to agriculture.

70
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,159
Which brings us to the start of this.

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,219
A time before tumbleweed in America.

72
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,739
And a time before homesteading.

73
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,959
It's the 1800's and the start of Westerners westerning.

74
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,249
Building their first farms and tiny towns.

75
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,139
Growing enough food to feed the adolescent nation was vital.

76
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,209
Nearly everyone's job had to be farming.

77
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,009
And the newly created Department of Agriculture had the job

78
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,009
of writing pro-tips on how best to do that,

79
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,179
along with collecting seeds and samples from the new continent.

80
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,449
Which is how all was normal, until one day a letter arrived for DOA.

81
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,879
(as South Dakota)
Heeeeeey, there's this a tumblin' weed giving us some trouble.

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,219
Can you come take a gander?

83
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,139
(as Grey)
And so she did.

84
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,909
Arriving to find South Dakota in bad shape.

85
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,769
A weedy infection rapidly developing, damaging the food supply.

86
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,399
These new weeds stole ground nutrients for themselves

87
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,259
before crops could even be planted,

88
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,199
or they would grow in between crops choking them out.

89
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,279
During harvest they hurt the draft animals

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,139
and clogged or broke the newly mechanized farm equipment.

91
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,409
Early estimates were crop losses of 20% because of the tumbles.

92
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,449
DOA tried to constrain the situation using education:

93
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,929
Wanted: Tumbleweed.

94
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,119
Kill on sight.

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,289
AKA Prickly Thistle

96
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,409
AKA Kali Tragus

97
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,459
AKA The Wind Witch

98
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,209
AKA The Russian Thistle.

99
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,809
This, by the way, is the motherland where the species is native.

100
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,949
And from where crop seed contaminated with tumbleseed probably came.

101
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,519
To arrive in South Dakota on perhaps a single farm to start the infection.

102
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,579
Which grew worse by the year.

103
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,779
And the Department of Agriculture's efforts to stop it were futile.

104
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,969
Way too much land.  Far too few people.

105
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,529
Worse, this new land was tumble-topia (and still is).

106
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,119
See this run of rectangle states?

107
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,629
It's the Great Plains, abutting the Great American Desert.

108
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,859
An enormous stretch of land: flat, open, windy.

109
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,169
South Dakota's neighbors had no chance, nor neighbor's neighbors.

110
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,079
From patient zero: BOOM!

111
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,629
By the turn of the century, the tumbleweed infection covered the interior,

112
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,859
eventually spreading north to Canada and south down to Mexico.

113
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,859
America's mountains were a barrier for a while,

114
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,609
until tumbleweed hitched a ride on the

115
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,779
trains that had freshly connected the continent,

116
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,319
jaunting over the mountains west and east

117
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,924
to establish themselves in every spare pocket of empty land.

118
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:09,979
Oh dear.

119
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,989
But it gets better.

120
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,179
Back to fires, specifically prairie fires.

121
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,529
A nice big field of dry wheat is just begging to burst into flames.

122
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,889
The only early tech to stop fires was to build fire breaks,

123
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,479
physically stopping the flames with neat, straight,

124
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,159
vitally empty stretches of land the fire could not cross.

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,739
But more perfect tunnels for tumbles you could not make.

126
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,999
Even if the fire breaks were kept clear,

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,909
fire makes its own wind, sucking in cold air from

128
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,519
ground level to blow out hot, up and over.

129
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,099
Thus, transforming tumbles into fireballs to breach the break.

130
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,749
So started the first volley in the War on Tumbleweed.

131
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,479
But for the Department of Agriculture

132
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,979
to eradicate the infection from the interior farmland and towns

133
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,979
where they did the most damage

134
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,439
would mean not only catching every weed and seed

135
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,169
across a third of a continent

136
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,579
with the cooperation of two annoyed international neighbors,

137
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,209
but also finding every patch of infection across the mountains in the other two thirds.

138
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,209
An impossible task.

139
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,449
So, uh, that's why tumbleweed are still here.

140
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,919
And have been around for so long and in such numbers.

141
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,249
People forget there was ever a before time.

142
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,029
But not the United States Department of Agriculture.

143
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,269
From the 1800s to 1900s,

144
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,909
to 2000s, still trying to rid America of the weed.

145
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,269
But so far without success.

146
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,779
That is the trouble with tumbles.

147
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:43,650
[playful country rockabilly music continues]
