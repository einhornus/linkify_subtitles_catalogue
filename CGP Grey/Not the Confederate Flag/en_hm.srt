## Script

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,759
This is not the confederate national flag:

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,329
When the United States split in twain during
the civil war this was the first flag her

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,489
rebel half used: The Bonnie Blue which she
copied from the Republic of West Florida.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,489
No really.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,789
This country existed: a border disagreement
between Spain and the US over the Louisiana

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,159
purchase gave some local rebels an opportunity
take over a fort in 1810, declare independence,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,379
as required with a flag, and run a government
-- for 78 days until The United States put

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,469
an end to that.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,169
*Anyway*, fast forward to the Civil War and
when Mississippi seceded from the Union she

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,699
adopted the flag of the tiny country that
had been within her borders.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,229
And it became the unofficial flag of the rebellion
but not for long.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,349
Blue wouldn't do.

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,859
That's a Yankee color.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,189
The new confederate government asked for deigns
submission and got several.

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,479
Including one from a German/Prussian artist
in Alabama who possibly took design cues from

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,689
the Austrian Empire.

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,689
And Betsy Ross.

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,539
(Side note: while we are talking about misnamed
flags, Betsy Ross probably didn't design this

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,339
flag -- there's no evidence to support that
she did, only stories from long after she

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,279
died -- Lady Godivia style.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,549
But we're getting off track here.)

23
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,939
The confederate government selected this as
her official flag and named it the "Stars

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,899
and Bars" -- so calling this the stars and
bars is wrong on two counts: that's not it's

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,039
name, this is a cross.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,039
These are bars.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,649
New flag adopted off to war, but on the battlefield,
the flag's similarity with the Union's was

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,099
confusing what with all the terror and smoke.

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,889
Nonetheless the Confederacy stuck with her
flag, but her Army wanted to avoid friendly

30
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,349
fire and so took one of the rejected designs
and squarified it into a battle flag.

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,589
The navy too, liked this design and eventually
switched, though using a brighter, presumably

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,999
non-yankee blue.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,139
The popularity of the official flag decreased
in the confederacy as time went on (even as

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,139
they kept increasing the stars) while the
popularity of the battle flag grew.

35
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,728
So in 1863 the Confederate Government tried
again, and went with white sticking the battle

36
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,099
flag in the corner.

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,220
This was *better* in sense that the flag looked
less like the Yankee's, but *worse* in that

38
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:54,789
the international symbol of surrender was
now in the background.

39
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,269
The army stuck with theirs.

40
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,099
Two years later, the confederate government
*again* changed the flag, adding a red bar

41
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,449
and a new, tough name.

42
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,569
Also, the design *slightly* rectangularlified
the battle flag.

43
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,698
This could no longer be mistaken for surrender
and was the last flag as 36 days later the

44
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,719
confederacy surrendered.

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,889
So this design was never technically the flag
of the confederate government -- but... close

46
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,170
enough.
