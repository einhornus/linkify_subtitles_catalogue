1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,749
The United States, picks its president with
the Electoral College, 538 votes distributed

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,279
by population (mostly) to the 50 States and
DC.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,489
To become president you need to win a majority
of those votes.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,349
But, 538 is an even number, so what happens
when the race for president is tied?

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,699
Don't worry, there's an 18th century solution
to the problem: if the Electoral College is

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,709
tied, the House of Representatives breaks
that tie.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,919
As the name implies, the House is filled with
representatives from each of the states.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,389
The more people in a state, the more Representatives
it has and their are 435 in total -- thankfully

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,439
an odd number and guaranteed tie breaker...
except there's a catch: each representative

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,738
doesn't get one vote, it's each *State* that
gets one vote.

11
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,869
So, Florida's 27 representatives have to decided
amongst themselves who to support before casting

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,639
Florida's one vote to help break the tie.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,169
Meanwhile, thinly-populated Alaska's sole
representative, has only to consult himself

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,488
before casting Alaska's vote.

15
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:03,109
This is an incredibly disproportionate system
because just ten states, California, Texas,

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,359
New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,029
contain more than half the population of the
United States but get only 20% of the votes

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,469
if the race for president is tied and the
other 40 states with less than half the population

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,289
get 80% of the votes.

20
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,289
While an exact tie is unlikely, this system
is also used if they're more than two candidates

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,079
for president and none of them gets a majority
in the Electoral College.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,938
Which is exactly what happened when four candidates
ran for president in 1824.

23
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,959
Andrew Jackson got the most votes from Americans
and the most votes in the Electoral College,

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,249
but not a majority, so the race was turned
over to the House of Representatives voting

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,309
as states who picked John Quiny Adams instead.

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,589
In a modern America with more states a three-way
race can have horrifically disproportionate

27
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,148
results: consider a third-party candidate
who the loves the small states and who the

28
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,849
small states love in return.

29
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,059
He gets the fewest Electoral College votes,
but enough to ensure that neither of the two

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,228
more popular candidates get a majority so
now the House decides the winner -- and those

31
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:05,139
26 smallest states representing just 17% of
the population can pick their man as president

32
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,868
even though 83% of Americans didn't vote for
him.

33
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,249
It's unlikely, but it really shouldn't even
be possible.

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,509
Anyway, all this talk of presidents has left
the Vice President unmentioned: a reasonable

35
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,649
person might assume, just comes along with
the President, but no.

36
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,439
When there's a tie the *Senate* independently
picks the Vice President so the United States,

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,738
could end up with a President from one party
and with a Vice President from the another,

38
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:32,568
which might make for some very uncomfortable
meetings.

39
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:37,589
But even this crazy system for resolving a
tie isn't guaranteed to work because are 100

40
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,149
members of the senate and in the House of
Representatives they're forced to vote as

41
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,059
50 states and many of those states have10
or 8 representatives making the whole system

42
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,289
tie-tackular with all of those even numbers.

43
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,659
So if the House can't pick the president but
the Senate has picked the Vice President then

44
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,909
the Vice President becomes acting president
until the House can make up its mind.

45
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,549
But if neither the House can pick the president
nor the Senate can decide the Vice President

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,229
then the speaker of the House becomes president
until either branch of congress picks *someone*.

47
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,950
So this systems is how the United States would
resolve a tied race for president, though

48
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:25,749
it might be faster (and more fair) to just
flip a coin.

49
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,458
Of course you could just get rid of the electoral
college, and thus this whole crazy system,

50
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,179
and instead have a national vote, perhaps
even with something fancy like preferential

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,980
voting, maybe that's just a crazy idea.
