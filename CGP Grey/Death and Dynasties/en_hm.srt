1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,559
Rulers are so often related: power passes from member to member, forming a dynasty.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,799
Not just with royalty or dictators, but also with representatives in a democracy.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,959
Families pass power, or vie with other families for a turn at the top, much more than chance would have.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:29,079
Dynasties seem so natural, you may have never deeply considered them, but you must if you wish to grasp and hold power as long as possible.

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,719
Even if you follow The Rules for Rulers we have discussed:

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,879
… swaying the keys to power, securing the treasure, and controlling the court: no man rules forever.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,979
Dictators with resources abundant and power unchallenged still die.

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,119
And representatives must contend with death both literal and political.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,479
But no matter what kind of ruler you are, your keys to power value their treasure.

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:03,459
They keep you in your position, not for love of you in particular, but for the rewards you provide, in general.

11
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,359
But dead rulers can't distribute treasure.

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,439
Thus as your grave approaches. your keys supporters get nervous.

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,859
Your impending death forces your keys to plan for your replacement, …

14
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:22,499
…not just to maintain their treasure, but also because a dead ruler surprise without plans in place will lead…

15
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,139
…to a scramble for power at best, and a blood bath at worst, …

16
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,739
… leaving many keys on the inside now, on the outside after.

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,459
This is why, if you happen to be sick, keep it secret:

18
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:43,119
If your keys even think you might die on them, they must start planning for the next ruler to avoid this.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,259
Which is what makes even a rumor about the ruler's health… concerning.

20
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:57,139
Whispers about your health are a destabilizing poison in the minds of your key supporters, nearly impossible to remove.

21
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,259
To the keys, your replacement is inevitable anyway, so why not start planning sooner.  Just in case.

22
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,639
Thus after a rumor, the keys might seem to stay on your side in their actions, …

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,499
…but you’re already dead in their minds.

24
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,279
You've lost control and will lose your throne, sooner than you like.

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,359
But while you can't defend against the reaper or extract poison from the minds of your key supporters:

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,039
There is a way to defend your power in this world from rumors of your departure to the next.

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,339
Family.  Family is the answer.

28
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,899
Dictatorships and democracies have so much family rule, because the key supporters want it.

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,859
As your term limit or deathbed approach, your family is there ready to keep turning the machinery of power:

30
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,499
…keep raising the treasure, keep the keys calm and plot-free.

31
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,019
Sure, warmhearted rulers may want to give their family advantages, …

32
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,059
…and being the ruler comes with many, …

33
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,519
…but the key supporters also want the ruler's family in positions of power because…

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,339
… the family that plots together, rules together.

35
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,659
Generational power: transcending death and term limits.

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:14,519
Thus your keys get to worry less about transitions of power, and you get to worry less about their plans for your replacement.

37
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,499
While key supporters won't ever simply trust you and your family,

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,139
…the keys can look at the motivating interests of you all:

39
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,919
Calculating that sticking with your family during a transition gives them better odds of staying on the inside …

40
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,279
…because they know you and your relatives.

41
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:40,259
Also, calculate sticking with the keys during a transition gives you better odds of staying on the thrown.

42
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,539
It's a virtuous cycle.  Formed by calculations that are like trust, but better.

43
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,859
The ruler gets to rule longer, the keys get to worry less, …

44
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,119
…and everything is smooth because when the king is dead, long live the king.

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,599
So put family in high-ranking military, business, or political positions.

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,559
Never mind their 'qualifications' because being family is the qualification.

47
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,319
They must work with your key supporters, so they know where the money comes from and how it is distributed.

48
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,139
Family's relationships with the keys keep everyone calm not just during the transition,…

49
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,898
… but more importantly for you and your political longevity: preceding it.

50
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:26,159
So even if you have no interest in a spouse and have no love for babies, nonetheless: acquire them.

51
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,559
Of course, the risk you run with family is they too will overthrow you.

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,019
Many a cunning prince has stabbed his king in the back once confident the keys won't mind.

53
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:44,799
But nothing is certain, you can only play the odds, and a ruler without family is more vulnerable to rivals and rumors.

54
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,179
Remember, your keys care about the security of their treasure in general, not you in particular.

55
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,279
And for them, a family of rulers is a safer investment.

56
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,379
Thus, possible regicide is the price you pay for buying the longer and securer reign a family brings.

57
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,279
Which is why: families are so popular among rulers and their key supporters.

58
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,719
Family is a tool for maintaining power, just like any other.

59
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:38,040
**playful music**
