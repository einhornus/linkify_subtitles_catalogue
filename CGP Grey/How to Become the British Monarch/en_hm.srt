00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,149
How to become the British Monarch:

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,389
Historically, the crown sat upon your head
mostly because you had the biggest army.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,479
When you died usually your eldest son kept
control over that army and so the crown relocated

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,939
to his head, though, of course, someone with
a bigger army could change the political landscape

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,169
quite abruptly.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,539
As time marched on and the world grew less
violent eventually in 1701 Parliament established

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,449
a set of rules to transfer the crown from
one head to another -- hopefully with less

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,139
turmoil than before.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,349
So here's how the 1701 rules work:

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,769
Frist: don't be Catholic.

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,519
The British Monarch is also the head of the
Church of England to which the monarch much

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,549
convert if not already a member.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,229
Except that if you're Catholic, no crown for
you.

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,459
The history of the royal family and how this
rule came to be is a story for another time,

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,779
but suffice it to say that bigger-army diplomacy
was involved.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,129
And, BTW, no you can't cleverly get around
this rule by converting from Catholicism to

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,509
something else then to Church of England.

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,109
In the eyes of the crown, Catholicism is transitive.

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,379
Second: don't be a bastard.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,919
Sometimes it's good to be the king, but it's
never good to be the illegitimate children

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,629
of the king -- who are out of line for the
crown literally from the moment of their conception.

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,900
If you're related to the monarch but are either
a Catholic or a bastard or both, the crown

23
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:15,109
has the delightful term 'Naturally Dead' to
refer to you and your lack of right to succession.

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,199
Third spouses don't count.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,799
While people often think of kings and queens
as a pair: that's not the way it works here.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,859
Spouses of Monarchs are known as Royal Consorts.

27
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,509
They may be called 'prince' or 'queen' but
as far as the crown is concerned, they're

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,609
not in line for the throne, they're just the
matching 23 Chromosomes needed for the creation

29
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,809
of the real heir.

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,899
Fourth and Finally: Male Primogeniture (whatever).

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,889
This is the algorithm of inheritance.

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,109
When the Monarch dies -- or abdicates -- but
usually dies -- the crown goes to the eldest

33
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,759
son who isn't 'naturally dead'.

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,489
If there happens to be an elder daughter tough
luck to her: baby brother gets the crown.

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,269
It's Simple enough, but there are non-obvious
cases: take a king with two sons: if the eldest

36
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,519
dies before the king does, obviously the crown
goes to the youngest (now oldest) brother.

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,949
But what if the eldest son gave the king a
grandson before death?

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,419
Where does the crown go then?

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,377
Well, the crown basically pretends that everyone
-- except the naturally dead -- is alive:

40
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,619
so upon the death of the king the crown goes
to his eldest son -- who is now sort of the

41
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,028
king who just really happens to be dead -- so
the rule kicks in again, and the crown goes

42
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:22,559
to *his* son, not as seems obvious now, his
brother.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,168
But if this 1701 rule means that eldest sons
get the crown, how did queens ever come to

44
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:28,168
be?

45
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,528
Basically, daughters were the last choice
of the crown, which is why there have been

46
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:32,608
so few.

47
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:36,839
To get the crown, a daughter had to be either
the only child of the monarch or the eldest

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,938
child without competing brothers.

49
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,018
So pregnant mothers must have made any daughters
with queenly aspirations quite nervous.

50
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,598
Now sometimes the branch of a family tree
die out: be it from war or plague or whatever

51
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,649
so the crown's contingency plan if it's at
a dead end is to back up one level, and then

52
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,558
apply the rules forward again looking for
a living head to sit upon.

53
00:02:56,559 --> 00:03:01,859
If no luck, back up again, and repeat and
repeat until a living heir is found.

54
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,579
And there will always be an heir.

55
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,108
The first king of England was over a thousand
years ago and the mathematics of human reproduction

56
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:13,188
backed up by DNA evidence reveals that just
about every European alive is distantly related

57
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,188
to him.

58
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,518
So the crown will eventually find a way.

59
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,589
So from the first king through the new millennium,
the various rules when along, making monarchs,

60
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,698
though with a gender biased result, that no
one seemed too bothered about until suddenly,

61
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:30,108
in 2013 for no particular reason at all, everyone
decided that the rules needed to be updated

62
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,249
*right now*.

63
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,619
So, Parliament and the Monarchy got together
and made some changes: most notably striking

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,058
the male part of rule #4.

65
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:42,828
From 2013 on the crown views all royal sons
and daughters with equal favor.

66
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,729
The only thing that matters is the order of
their birth.

67
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,509
So prior to 2013 the boy in a set of fraternal
twins in development could sit back and relax

68
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,998
-- secure that the crown would be his no matter
what happened on delivery day, but in the

69
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:59,289
post 2013 gender-equal world it's now a race
for the door to win the crown.
