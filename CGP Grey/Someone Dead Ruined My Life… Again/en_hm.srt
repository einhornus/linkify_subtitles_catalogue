1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,799
Tada!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,339
It's a video about Tiffany!  I hope you like it.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,199
Psst.  Hey, hey.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,284
Would you like to know more?

5
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:11,313
Okay great.  So listen, I need to tell you about this poem.

6
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:15,393
Come with me behind the scenes where I've been working on this for...

7
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:17,119
I don't even know how long.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,119
Take a seat.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,901
Get comfortable.

10
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:20,879
It all began with these articles I read saying

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,450
the name Tiffany is very old, maybe medieval.

12
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:26,136
What a cute and easy video, Past-Grey thought,

13
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:27,084
and it could have been

14
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,099
:: it could have been ::

15
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,099
if I'd just left things alone,

16
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,267
but no, I wanted to read the article sources, which

17
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:36,181
turned out didn't often contain the name Tiffany at all,

18
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:38,821
but rather the ye-olden-name Theophania,

19
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:40,924
or the super-old Theophanu.

20
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:43,873
And like, maybe these medieval ladies called themselves Tiff,

21
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:46,616
but that's just a bit too cute, isn't it?

22
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:49,930
To me it looked like the sort of Lady Godiva story where later writers

23
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:53,039
say a thing happened but there's no evidence from the time that it did,

24
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,719
because it's a fairy tale.

25
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,130
The kind history is full of once you go looking.

26
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:58,273
[whispering]
Don't go looking.

27
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:01,267
So for a while the Tiffany video teetered on the edge of getting binned,

28
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:03,850
but it turned out my Lady Godiva suspicious were wrong

29
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:06,859
when some medieval Tiffany's did turn up to save the project.

30
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,059
But the poem happened before that.

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,273
And listen, I need to tell you about it, otherwise,

32
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:16,524
I might just explode trying to contain all the excruciating details

33
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:20,341
and number of obsessive hours poured into this f-- poem.

34
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:23,804
And I can't let it all have been for nothing.

35
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,859
Okay, ready?  No?  Too bad.

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,821
Here's the poem.

37
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:34,010
[clears throat]
Ahem.

38
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,289
It's okay.  That's it.

39
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,416
But what isn't okay is that this poem popped up in modern writings

40
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:42,650
implying it's proof that Tiffany is maybe medieval,

41
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:45,729
but never with the poem's date or an author attached.

42
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,353
Making it impossible to pin to a timeline.

43
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:50,353
Which made the poem annoying.

44
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:53,130
Doubly so because it's supposed to be a joke.

45
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:56,249
Like here it is in this 1859 history book

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,084
with this weird French style humorous illustration.

47
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,330
But, I don't get it?

48
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,724
Is it the name of the dog?

49
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:02,959
[irately]
What's the joke?!

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,849
If you get it, please leave a comment.
I just... I need to know.

51
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,621
Anyway, when you're reading about a topic,

52
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:09,621
this the sort of thing that happens a lot.

53
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:12,479
There's some detail you keep stumbling over and over

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,330
and it could be the critical clue.

55
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,570
I'm looking for the earliest Tiffany A-N-Y.

56
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,839
There's a Tiffany A-N-Y right here.

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,869
Maybe the very first if I could just pin the poem to its proper place, but no.

58
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,319
I had just resolved to give up on this poem when

59
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,501
The Tiffany's of America arrived at my door,

60
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:30,981
which I had ordered... weeks ago?

61
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:33,519
To hopefully help with the main Tiffany video.

62
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,821
But it was just 90% a literal list of people named

63
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:40,376
Tiffany in America with hilariously unclear photos.

64
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,519
The book was written by Nelson Otis Tiffany

65
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,656
and thanks Charles Lewis Tiffany for making the book possible

66
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:48,199
with his "liberal contributions of money."

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,599
I love how explicit that is.

68
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,949
Then, totally unrelated, there follows a description

69
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,667
of how the Tiffany family crest is the

70
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:56,376
"most beautiful thing of its kind we have ever seen."

71
00:02:56,377 --> 00:03:00,833
And then two pages of the densest family flattery ever put in print.

72
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:04,009
But in between those two sections, to mock me,

73
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,679
the poem appeared again.

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,169
Without a date... but with a footnote path the follow.

75
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,119
This is the moment I broke.

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,101
And swore to the gods above and below

77
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:18,170
I would find the primary source of this Brittany Tiffany poem.

78
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,747
No matter the time.

79
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:21,256
No matter the cost.

80
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:23,473
And when you give that to the gods,

81
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:26,409
they of course played a joke upon Grey,

82
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,987
making his pursuit of this poem as painful as possible.

83
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:30,844
Here's what happened.

84
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:33,096
The Tiffany's of America got the poem from

85
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:35,393
Richmondshire, its Ancient Lords and Edifices,

86
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:45,427
Which I ordered and when it arrived, found the full title to be

87
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:47,339
I opened it and out fell an old map!

88
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,101
Which is a thrilling moment, no matter what's mapped on the map.

89
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:51,759
After checking for spots marked X,

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,359
back to the book to find the poem,

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,227
which had a pencil highlight mark and a note below.

92
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:58,159
It seems whoever owned this book before me

93
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,650
was also on their own poetic Tiffany journey.

94
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:02,859
Maybe it was Nelson Otis Tiffany... I don't know.

95
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,349
So Richmondshire, Its Ancient Lords and Edifices: A Concise Guide to the Localities of Interest to the Tourist and Antiquary; With Short Notices of Memorable Men

96
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,547
lists the poem as from the author M. Thierry.

97
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:13,701
Now buying old rare books gets expensive real fast.

98
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:17,768
So I headed down to my local library to try and track M. Thierry down,

99
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,219
which took a while because

100
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,507
1) I didn't know then but I do know now that 'M' is an old abbreviation for Mister

101
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:26,509
and the author referenced was Mr. Augustin Thierry

102
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,029
and his book the History of the Conquest of England by the Normans.

103
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,370
And 2) my library pre-dates the Dewey Decimal System,

104
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,819
which makes every book search

105
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,170
an adventure through 17th century organizational idiosyncrasity.

106
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,421
Which is delightful when you're browsing.

107
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:43,930
But infuriating when you're in the wrong section about England

108
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,039
and you can't find the book you're looking for,

109
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,559
because you should be in the England only section.

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,979
But not here, behind the little book elevator.

111
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,627
Anyway, Thierry's book was on the shelf.

112
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:55,701
I grabbed it, sat down with it, and flipped through the pages to find the poem.

113
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:58,479
and that History of the Conquest of England by the Normans

114
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,099
isn't the primary source either, pointing to

115
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,089
[with difficulty]
Hearne, Praefatio ad Johan. de Fordun, Scotichronicon.

116
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,930
[with a sigh]
Okay, what's the Scotichronicon?

117
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,859
According to Wikipedia, it's a history book of Scotland

118
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,519
started in the 1300s by a priest in Aberdeen

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,939
and continued after his death by an abbot in Inchcolm.

120
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,444
These historians worked to cover the history of Scotland

121
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,979
from their present day back to the literal genesis.

122
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,059
A rather epic undertaking deserving the epic name the Scotchinomicron [sic].

123
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,701
Fun fact!  This book is one of the earliest references to Robin Hood.

124
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:34,661
Though the authors take a rather... hmmm more dim view

125
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:38,730
of The Hood and his hoi polloi fans than most modern interpretations.

126
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:48,341
According to them,

127
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:48,993
Interesting.

128
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:52,589
But I didn't come to the library to track down the earliest reference to Robin Hood.

129
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,273
:: It's the Piers Plowman poem by the way. ::

130
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:56,059
I here to find the Scotchichromicon [sic]

131
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,987
in the Scotland history section, which is in the dark.

132
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:03,016
Sure glad my phone has a flashlight.

133
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:06,929
There it is... the Scotcheranomicon [sic].

134
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,199
Oh, look all these hand written notes.

135
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,844
Last time this was checked out was 1995.

136
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:15,789
Alas there was no poem on page 172

137
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,341
But maybe that page number was for a different edition,

138
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:22,049
so there was nothing to do but start flipping and skimming,

139
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,604
flipping and skimming, over and over,

140
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:28,529
and over and over and over and over,

141
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,839
through every single crinkly page

142
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,187
to find the Brittany Tiffany poem nowhere.

143
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:38,859
Maybe the poem was among those pages and I just missed it.

144
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,009
I mean... the book is in Latin.

145
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,539
It turned out... not.

146
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,793
I didn't know it at the time but I did have the wrong edition,

147
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:47,519
but in an unexpected way.

148
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,669
This one printed in MDCCLIX.

149
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,581
But if you were to search further,

150
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:57,519
say at the largest library in the world with 200 million volumes,

151
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,764
you could find an earlier edition printed in MDCCXXII.

152
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:06,659
Which was both much smaller and with hilariously large font.

153
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,753
Like the author was trying to puff up the book.

154
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:14,259
But in this one, on page 170, there she was!  Brittany Tiffany A-N-Y.

155
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,856
I was thrilled to have found truly medieval evidence of Tiffany.

156
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:24,539
I had the primary source!  I could pin the poem to the 1400s!

157
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,770
Or so I thought.

158
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:29,073
Until I remembered that that these guys wrote in Latin,

159
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,459
and this poem is in modernish English.

160
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,839
How could that be?

161
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,399
Well, it's because this poem isn't in the Scotchichronicon [sic] at all.

162
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,644
It's a footnote added by the editor of this 1722 edition.

163
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:51,884
And it's also not the primary source, the editor adding,

164
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:52,707
Charily?

165
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:57,139
That's an old word that means "cautious or warily."  That's weird.

166
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,256
And ancient.  How ancient?

167
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:01,370
Fast forward past much time spent searching

168
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,256
Coningsby family records, without luck.

169
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:05,656
Though, of course, now that I'm talking about this I know

170
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:08,589
some long descendant of the Coningsby clan will show up at my door

171
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,661
with a reliquary box and the poem inside,

172
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:13,084
which I'll need to send off for some radiocarbon dating.

173
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:16,879
And I also know that every example of an old Tiffany A-N-Y

174
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,981
will be sent to my door forever more,

175
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:20,456
But that's Future-Grey's problem.

176
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:21,439
For Current-Grey

177
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,389
:: well now Past-Grey at the time of writing and research ::

178
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,181
the one path the gods had directed before me,

179
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:28,379
I wish I had not followed through.

180
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,129
Who is Theo [sic] Hearnius, the editor?

181
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,908
Well, to find out, step one is to find his non-Latinized name.

182
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,793
Thomas Hearne.

183
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:38,604
Thomas Hearne was... ehh... well we'll get to that.

184
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:41,952
But he worked at the Bodleian Library at Oxford in the early 1700s

185
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:44,283
and published lots of editions of medieval texts,

186
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:45,541
Scottochromicon [sic] among them.

187
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,609
Now trying to find more information about

188
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,256
why someone wrote a footnote 300 years ago seemed hopeless,

189
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:53,256
but Google, against all odds,

190
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:55,861
turned up the collected letters of Alexander Pope.

191
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:57,770
A contemporary of Hearne's in England,

192
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:18,101
who wrote a 35-page letter about Hearne that begins

193
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:20,529
Which at first sounds like, "Wow, what a fan!"

194
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,393
And this 35-page letter by Alexander Pope

195
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:25,964
happens to mention the Brittany Tiffany poem,

196
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,741
though in a context that seems, off?

197
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:32,730
Saying Hearne had so many not just historical documents,

198
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,181
but poems in particular,

199
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:37,061
that it would waste your time to tell you about all of them.

200
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:40,181
Pope then says Hearne wanted to be useful by saving them all,

201
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:44,216
but then lists several clearly-useful-to-no-one-ever poems,

202
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,644
including Brittany Tiffany.

203
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:48,467
It's just sort of weird, and I would have left it at that,

204
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:49,799
:: should have left it at that ::

205
00:09:49,800 --> 00:10:03,164
but then this passage caught my eye,

206
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:15,964
That's a very "I don't love drama" sentence from Pope, isn't it?

207
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:21,049
Pope then goes on to fill his 35-page letter with nothing but corrections

208
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:29,073
for every mistake Hearne ever made in all of his work in this infuriating

209
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:30,019
kind of way.

210
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,799
Some observations on his writing indeed.

211
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:44,189
Hearne gets a date wrong, and Pope says,

212
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,719
You say this man in 1274 studied at Canterbury College and he wrote about it.

213
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,107
But I'm afraid to tell you the college was not built until 1363.

214
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:57,187
Therefore, this man must have either lived 89 years before he was born

215
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:12,421
or written of a place many years before it was built.

216
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,129
Mee-yow!

217
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:20,456
Alexander Pope, it turns out, is the human who coined the phrase

218
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,089
Of course, only after reading the entire letter,

219
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,559
did I realize I could have skipped it had I first seen

220
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,639
Pope hanging out on the bottom of Hearne's Wikipedia page

221
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,376
calling Hearne's life work unappealing and monkish.

222
00:11:32,377 --> 00:11:34,939
Hearne complained into his diary that Alexander Pope,

223
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,061
one of the most quoted authors in the English language,

224
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:40,379
just below Shakespeare and the Bible, lacked scholarship.

225
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,021
Alexander Pope, in turn created a character for one of his plays

226
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:46,593
based on Hearne named Wormius,

227
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:48,889
a know-nothing know-it-all pedant.

228
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,924
Hearne shot back saying Pope's play was

229
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:58,409
This delicious beef was the only highlight of my readings,

230
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,409
so I needed to know more.

231
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,484
But putting plus Hearne plus Wormius into Google returned

232
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,856
exactly one result,

233
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,987
the Wikipedia page itself, which is super sus.

234
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:11,129
I mean, does information even exist if it's not on the Internet?

235
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,136
Oh right, of course.

236
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:15,639
So I had to check the listed footnote, which wasn't at the library.

237
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,684
So I ordered the book.

238
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,819
It arrived, I opened it, I read it, and the Hearne-Wormius thing checks out.

239
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,729
Amazing!

240
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,159
But even after that, Alexander Pope just couldn't let it go for some reason,

241
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:40,810
and after Hearne's death, he wrote,

242
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,959
Alex... geez!

243
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,929
Uhh so as you can see, we've traveled down many paths here.

244
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,861
And at this point I really needed a friend to talk to about this in my life.

245
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:54,739
The number of people willing to listen for months on end

246
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,541
to updates about not even the very broad topic of the origin of the name Tiffany,

247
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,759
:: Remember?  That's where we started. ::

248
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,349
not even of the exact original source of one poem that mentions the name Tiffany A-N-Y,

249
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,219
but of two dead dude's schoolboy-level squabbles that are tangentially related to Tiffany

250
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,729
is zero.

251
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,050
But then there was hope.

252
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:17,587
I can't even remember how I found it now,

253
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,724
but I came across another Hearne Burn

254
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:25,941
via historian John Horace Round in his

255
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:29,089
Complaining about Hearne's lack of document date questioning,

256
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,659
ignoring of internal evidence, and superficial examinations,

257
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,499
leading to publishing more wrong dates polluting the timeline for everyone.

258
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,439
Oh!  And Hearne also got the poem's surname spelling wrong... twice.

259
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,399
Which is why nothing turned up for 'Cognisby family records' earlier.

260
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,079
Oooph!

261
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,009
At this point, Hearne having cost me so much time

262
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,507
and feeling so thoroughly alone in the world,

263
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,649
I was excited to find in John Horace Round

264
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,010
a friend to phone and complain with over coffee.

265
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:58,547
As it happens, he even translated part of the Domesday Book,

266
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:00,769
which was the very first source I checked

267
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,324
when starting the Tiffany project so long ago.

268
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,324
We were going to have loads to talk about!

269
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,139
While searching for his digits, I realized

270
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,099
in my excitement, I had missed the original publication date of his work.

271
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,779
Round had died a hundred years ago.

272
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,799
And I was back to being Grey "No Mates"... as usual.

273
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,496
Okay so look, this side path I've been carving out

274
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:23,701
to even be able to talk about the Brittany Tiffany poem

275
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:30,119
is only a tiny tiny part of all of the explorations that had to happen

276
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,467
to make the main Tiffany video.

277
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:35,849
I've been here, alone for... oh gods!

278
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,709
[dazedly]
Half a year as the only one alive who cares about any of this.

279
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,699
This script is so long now.  Will anyone make it this far?

280
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,699
[with emotion]
Is anyone here?

281
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,139
[sighs]

282
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,459
Okay, snap out of it.

283
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,039
Now in my journeys, I had learned two things about Hearne.

284
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,189
First, his contemporaries referred to him as an 'antiquarian,'

285
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,130
which in my head translated as old-timey for 'historian'

286
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:03,579
but was actually old-timey code for 'hoarder.'

287
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,119
Hearne loved collecting every historic document he could find,

288
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,879
but was not very good at sorting them out.

289
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,689
The second thing was that Hearne's edition of the Scottronomicon [sic]

290
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,929
from which all sources pointed back to as the providence of the poem

291
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,329
is worse than useless.

292
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,456
As not only are his contributions of dubious value,

293
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:23,319
but he also took it upon himself to cut out a lot,

294
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,890
which explains why his edition was printed in giant font.

295
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,210
This is not considered canonical.

296
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,690
And this should have been the end of it,

297
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:35,267
but there was still something left to try pin to the timeline.

298
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:40,021
Was this Tiffany A-N-Y a real person and when did she live?

299
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,979
Okay, I know.

300
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,884
In retrospect, it seems obvious I should have started here.

301
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:45,747
Painfully obvious.

302
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:50,059
But you only know at the end what is the fastest way from the beginning.

303
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,884
Now surely, I thought, at least tracking down genealogical records

304
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:57,199
of the family the poem mentioned everything would check out.

305
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,479
Right?  Wrong.

306
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,839
So as a reminder, the poem starts with William from Britany, wife Tiffany.

307
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,769
William Coningsby was a real person in the 1300s in England, not Brittany.

308
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,513
And his wife was Beatrice, not Tiffany.

309
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:13,409
They had a son, Thomas Coningsby, who did go to Brittany,

310
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,719
with the Black Prince (who was alive at the time) to battle.

311
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,410
And Thomas, while fighting, became a prisoner of war.

312
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:23,039
However, his captor agreed to let Thomas go if he would marry his daughter, Tiffany.

313
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,987
Which he did.

314
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:27,084
And it was Thomas who came out of Brittany with his wife Tiffany.

315
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,136
Except not, because if you look up her paperwork,

316
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,679
[shouting]
her name is actually Theophania!

317
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,979
She's only called Tiffany hundreds of years later!

318
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,329
[shouting continues]
So the poem isn't right about anything!

319
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,056
[voice breaking]
GOD DAMN YOU, HEARNE!

320
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,644
Everything is wrong!

321
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:43,289
[wildly]
And the poem is evidence of nothing useful at all.

322
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,859
[sigh]
I'm sorry.  It's just... it's been a lot.

323
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,633
So here's the final working theory.

324
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:53,221
Hearne knew the Coningsby family who either told him of the poem,

325
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,970
or perhaps he spotted it himself,

326
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:58,536
expressed an outsized interest in their collection of old papers,

327
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:00,044
as he was wont to do,

328
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:03,819
but either way, when editing his edition of the Scotichronicon,

329
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,730
and it mentioned the family, that triggered his memory,

330
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,524
and he added in his footnote,

331
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,439
wrong as he saw it or wrong as he remembered it.

332
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,299
That note in his non-canonical edition, through pure bad luck,

333
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,939
got swept up in the paper-writing footnote copy-paste game

334
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,118
where no one checks the original and the context that the name 'Tiffany'

335
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,199
is not actually in the original book got lost.

336
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,033
At least now the timeline is complete,

337
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:32,456
but all this work has shown is that

338
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:36,410
in the 1700s the name Tiffany A-N-Y existed,

339
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:40,010
which was not in question at all at the beginning.

340
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:43,449
For the gods' capricious tormenting pleasure alone,

341
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,399
this path went absolutely nowhere,

342
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,250
provided nothing of value,

343
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:52,467
and drained many hours of my sadly finite life.

344
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:55,729
Uhh... thanks for listening?

345
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,404
I guess I just really needed to get out all of this frustration

346
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:02,273
to tell you the story of tracking down a poem

347
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:05,953
that didn't even make it into the main video.

348
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:11,587
[deflatedly]
The end.

349
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:13,484
Hello.

350
00:18:13,485 --> 00:18:17,804
Thank you for making it to not just the end of the video, but

351
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,919
after the end of the video.

352
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,959
Welcome.

353
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,901
Well, that ended up being quite a journey over the past half a year.

354
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,027
Sometimes in making a video,

355
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:33,907
the path through the Forest of All Knowledge is clearly marked out.

356
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:41,569
Other times, you have something much more difficult to try to get through.

357
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,507
[chuckling]
Oh, don't step on the... whoa!

358
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:50,179
And occasionally, there's almost nothing,

359
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,799
and you're in danger of getting quite lost.

360
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,341
But this is the job.

361
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:59,221
To turn something that is unmarked,

362
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,639
into something that's slightly marked.

363
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,627
Perhaps something that's been completed with trusses

364
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:09,827
to get you over the dangerous and difficult parts.

365
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:14,529
Some of the videos I make take unreasonably long amounts of time

366
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,659
and unreasonably large amounts of effort.

367
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,239
Things that are frankly not very good business sense

368
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,873
from a YouTube algorithm sort of way but,

369
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,524
I know that, as a viewer,

370
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,821
I love it when people make those sorts of videos.

371
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:33,644
And, I imagine if you're still watching,

372
00:19:33,645 --> 00:19:36,810
you're one of the people who likes those kinds videos as well.

373
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:40,079
I've resisted for years coming up with a name

374
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,896
for the people who support the channel.

375
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:43,736
I've never really liked that stuff but

376
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:45,736
I've changed my thoughts on that because

377
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:49,129
I realize that they really are part of the team now.

378
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,789
And, I know how this is going to sound, but I really mean it.

379
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:59,244
The past six months I have definitely felt

380
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:02,589
very alone at times working on this,

381
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,799
but one of the things that has helped me push on

382
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,279
with a crazy project like this

383
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,627
is knowing that there are a lot of people

384
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,747
who really care about these videos.

385
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:20,044
The capricious winds of the YouTube gods can not be relied upon.

386
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:24,029
But people willing to back projects directly that they really like,

387
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,621
it means so much.

388
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:30,364
These videos aren't for everyone.

389
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:31,884
They're for you.

390
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:36,539
So if you would like to become a Bonnie Bee and help support the creation of future videos,

391
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,729
which will also get you access to some of the behind the scenes of how the videos are made,

392
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,896
I just have one requirement first.

393
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:46,421
You must be financially self supporting,

394
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:48,979
so, no students in particular.

395
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,204
I want people to work on themselves

396
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:56,227
and work on their own lives before they try to help me out.

397
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:57,724
I will be fine.

398
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,370
Make sure you're good first.

399
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:03,059
And, I plan on doing this for a long time.

400
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,473
I have been doing this for a long time.

401
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,833
I'll be here later.

402
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,656
So, as long as you're set there.

403
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:12,421
If you would like to join, you can click here.

404
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:14,970
And, thank you so much.

405
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,971
I'll see you in the next video.
