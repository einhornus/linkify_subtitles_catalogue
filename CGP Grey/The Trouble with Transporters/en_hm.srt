00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,459
In Star Trek, the transporter moves you from one spot to another, saving on shuttle fuel (and special effects budgets).

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,159
In-universe, it's 'the safest way to travel'.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,439
Yes, *sometimes*, two guys die horrible, mutilated deaths under rare circumstances...

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,539
...but trillions of individuals transport to work every morning without a hiccup.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,079
But, what if the transporter isn't as safe as claimed...

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,299
...what if the death rate isn't point almost nothing percent, but one-hundred percent...

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,099
...because the transporter is a suicide box.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,259
First, how does the transporter work?

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,159
There are technical manuals, with pages and pages of hilariously over-specific details...

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,219
that yet say *so little*.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,279
Star Trek is nothing if not consistently inconsistent, but, taking the most common elements:

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,279
First, the transporter scans you down to the quark, takes apart your atoms and sends the pieces of you to the destination for reassembly.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,059
But, is it *you* on the other end?  Or a copy that thinks it's you?

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,699
Well, who *is* you?

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,499
That's a hell of a big question, but let's try to be good scientists about it:

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,839
...we don't assume there's a magic part of you that can't be measured.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,318
After all, if it can't be measured, that means by definition it can't affect anything.

18
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,199
So Occam's Razor it away and we take you as you seem to be: a collection of atoms arranged to think they're you.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,499
And because the arrangement of atoms in post-transport you is exactly the same as pre-transport...

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,699
...you must be you.  Case closed.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,299
Butâ€¦ You might still have this nagging feeling that your experience of stepping into the transporter will be...

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,379
...a funny sound, a bright light -- then nothingness eternal..

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,319
...while down on the planet, a brand-new life, complete with all your memories up to the moment before your death

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,859
...popped into existence and assumed it's you...

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,179
*How could it otherwise?*

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,159
It lives a life as short as the mission...

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,919
...and a new creature with the memories of you both makes it back to the ship.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,219
If true, multiply this by all the life forms in all the ships in all the star systems...

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,559
...and this transport technology is a silent holocaust...

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,139
...which makes an average episode of 'Trek rather grim watching.

31
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,979
And it's a small mercy when a crew member takes the turbolift rather than site-to-site transport.

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,479
But again, the measurements check out so perhaps we're being paranoid and we're already late for our holiday on Risa so just step inside already.

33
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,399
But atom reassembly is the optimistic version and can't be how the transporter really works...

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,499
...because sometimes accidents combine two crew into one - or split one into two.

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:21,499
There aren't enough atoms in you to make a second you, so the transporter has to be turning atoms into energy and energy into atoms.

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,699
You are destroyed, used to charge a battery, then recreated anew.

37
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,959
This really seems like death.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,259
But the philosophy majors in the room are *dying* to bring up "The Ship of Theseus" now -- so fine.

39
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:39,919
You take this ship on an adventure.  As parts get worn, you replace each until eventually no piece is original.

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,539
When you return is the "Ship of Theseus" still the same "Ship of Theseus" you left on?

41
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:52,059
Seems so - and this is what your body does daily via eating (bringing in new atoms) and excreting (losing atoms).

42
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,699
Compare to the "The Cutty Sark", a colonial tea ship burned down and restored with new parts.

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,939
Is it still the same "Cutty Sark"?

44
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,719
The result is the same: all new parts - only the time it took is different.

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,719
If you're happy "Ship of Theseus"-ing through life (as you already do), ...

46
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,639
...then getting "Cutty Sark"-ed by transport shouldn't matter.  Right...?

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,079
However... step into a working transporter with a broken disassembler - and death is revealed:

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,039
...pre-transport and post-transport you can disagree on who is you.

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,359
And when Scotty tells pre-transport you "Sorry, the disassembler is broken, give us a minute to fix it", you aren't going to wait around.

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,619
That a copy of you made it to the destination is no consolation.

51
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,899
The transporter has to be a suicide box.

52
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,119
OK, so why worry about the metaphysical implications of fictional technology?

53
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,979
Because the transporter points us to the problem of consciousness.

54
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:52,759
We were quick to cut out the idea of the unmeasurable before -- because everything we can measure about the copy is identical...

55
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,659
...but there is something unmeasurably different.

56
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:04,579
The transporter forces confrontation with the possibility that there's something about being a conscious creature that isn't measurable from the outside.

57
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,379
Did we not contain conscious brains ourselves, how would we know that other brains are conscious?

58
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,879
Truth be told, you can really only know that *you* are conscious...

59
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,518
-- and it seems polite to give other people the benefit of the doubt.

60
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,879
But were a computer to claim that it was conscious, how would you know?

61
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
Your continuous stream of consciousness is your life.

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,879
And you are the only one who can experience it, who can know if it *exists* and if it is continuous.

63
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,019
And transporters are scary because they cause breaks in that consciousness.

64
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,199
Making a copy that lives the life that you have left, with no one the wiser.

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,199
With no one able to be wiser.

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,379
And while transporters aren't real, breaks in consciousness are.

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:51,139
If you go for surgery, when they put you under, you can't be sure if it's you that woke up.

68
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,279
For that matter, your bed might be a suicide machine.

69
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,639
Every night's slip into unconsciousness, the warm embrace of the reaper...

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,499
...and every morning the first and only day of a new creature's conscious life.

71
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,519
It's impossible to know.

72
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,059
Sleep well tonight.
