1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,105
The first people who lived here named themselves. 

2
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:05,585
Across the continent, in hundreds of languages.

3
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:09,452
The word for people - or the First People - was what they used.

4
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:12,839
Other people existed, to trade and talk and fight with.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,865
But the continent was vast and travel slow.

6
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:18,865
There were no horses and wouldn't be for millennia.

7
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:20,705
No group could know all the others.

8
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:23,225
So there was no single name for all.

9
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:26,412
Then, from across the sea, came a new other people.

10
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:29,452
Who brought with them great and terrible things.

11
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:32,612
They too had a name for themselves in their own language.

12
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:36,092
But they also brought a name for the First People: Indians.

13
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:38,092
We are in the future from this past.

14
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:42,305
And you in the future from my present (possibly the far future).

15
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:45,359
And the word 'Indian' may have just made you uncomfortable.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,932
So let’s talk about words. 

17
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:48,505
Words are what we make them.

18
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,132
Without the words surrounding them,

19
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,879
without brains to interpret them,

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,985
words are but whispers of wind.

21
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,359
It’s a word’s utility to the speaker

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,919
and the reaction of the listener

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,569
that causes words to be born and to live and to die.

24
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,339
Long after its first use in the New World,

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,619
the early British and American Empires needed a word

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,209
to collectively describe the First People.

27
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,369
And 'Indian', despite its confused origins, was that word.

28
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,229
As the Empires expanded, there was terrible conflict.

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,339
The First People found themselves decimated and scattered.

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,989
Many forcibly moved to reservations.

31
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,279
Land unknown with others unknown.

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,649
Needing to act as one new group to survive.

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,079
To hold onto any sovereignty.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,739
As the world progressed from horses, to steam, to electricity,

35
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,549
the nature of conflict changed.

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,249
Fewer guns and germs.

37
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,039
More minds and laws.

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,349
But the First People were now a tiny minority in the land

39
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,249
While also a multiplicity of groups. 

40
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,599
For comparison, there are about 200 countries in the world.

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,339
Within the United States, the reservations number more than 300.

42
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,669
Within and without those areas of special sovereignty,

43
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,909
there are more than 500 federally recognized tribes.

44
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,559
Each with a different name.

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,379
To win the minds of the majority,

46
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,538
to get laws securing sovereignty, 

47
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,279
hundreds of different names for different groups is not helpful.

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,989
A collective name - one clear in the minds of the majority - is needed. 

49
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,989
A name useful for unity.

50
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,739
In the time of Civil Rights, 'American Indians', 

51
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,929
shortened to 'Indians', 

52
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,969
was (despite its confused origins) that name. 

53
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,569
For words are what we make them.

54
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,859
And we can unmake them. 

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,229
As I write this script looking at the past, 

56
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,819
and toward you in the future,

57
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,019
I will bet that future history will unmake 'Indian'

58
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,409
in favor of 'Native American', or something else. 

59
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,029
You know if this has happened.

60
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,469
But here, as part of working on this series,

61
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,419
I've traveled to many reservations to see them

62
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,419
and to talk to the people who live in them.

63
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,749
On reservations, the word 'Indian' is still used

64
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,219
without hesitation or negative connotation.

65
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,709
Used as identity, not universally, but near it.

66
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,309
You, like me, may be surprised to hear that,

67
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,019
given the word’s confused origins.

68
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,489
But words are what we make them.

69
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,339
And Indians have made the word theirs.

70
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,559
Now, as for 'Native American', while preferred by some,

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,149
there exists in others a strong dislike

72
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,789
and resentment of the name.

73
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,549
The word created to explain

74
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,689
this dislike was passed on to me.

75
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,019
And the only way to explain fully is to pass it on to you.

76
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,879
[Grey takes deep breath]
So, the dislike comes from… 'overinclusivity'

77
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,109
[audience gasps]
I know.  I know.

78
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,189
*I know.*

79
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,929
But let’s stay thoughtful and examine

80
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,409
what this word was created to communicate.

81
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,479
For at least 300 years,

82
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,919
'Indian' has meant the first people in this part of the world.

83
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,319
Separated at first but thrust into a shared history.

84
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,109
It is clear.  It is sharp.

85
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,949
The word 'Native American', less so.

86
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,539
It can include everyone from the top to bottom of two continents.

87
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,959
A vast number of different cultures

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,209
and current-day goals and concerns.

89
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,849
The histories of North, Central, and South America

90
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,619
are as divergent as the histories of Asia, Europe, and Africa.

91
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,079
To call a person from here, here, or here

92
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,019
a 'Native Afro-Eurasian' would be so over-inclusive

93
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,799
as to make it difficult for that human to strongly

94
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,439
identify with or rally others under.

95
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,699
So it goes for 'Native American'.

96
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,239
Additionally, it can feel like yet another thing forced from the outside.

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,869
Talking to people about this project over the last…

98
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,569
[Grey sighs]
Five years… revealed a strong correlation.

99
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,179
The closer a person had ever been to a reservation,

100
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,949
the more likely they would use 'Indian'. 

101
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,429
The farther, the more likely they would use the word 'Native American'.

102
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,619
And that's understandable.

103
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,289
Is 'Indian' okay?

104
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,259
*Maybe.*

105
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,439
But 'Native American' won't be wrong.

106
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,329
And it's useful to express concern and sensitivity as an outsider.

107
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,259
But this creates an unstable balance

108
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,199
between insider and outsider use of a word.

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,439
If the majority hesitates over a word,

110
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,149
it slides into uncomfortability or worse. 

111
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,869
If the majority decides a word is unacceptable,

112
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,059
so it becomes.

113
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,319
Groups should be able to name themselves,

114
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,619
but when they’re small, they often can't. 

115
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,619
The word used to describe themselves,

116
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,629
outsiders, through sheer numbers, redefine.

117
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,009
At the time of writing, this is happening to 'Indian'

118
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,839
but the leading replacement is not as universally well-regarded

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,109
inside reservations as those outside may expect.

120
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,369
As we will talk about, many things have been given to the First People.

121
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,819
Promises.  And rights.  And lands.

122
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,029
Only once used and adopted by them to be taken away.

123
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,569
So it may go again.

124
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,889
Thus, this series will use 'American Indian' or 'Indian' for three main reasons.

125
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,759
One.  The word is clear in geography and history. 

126
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,989
Limited to the first people of what is now the continental United States.

127
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,739
Two.  The tribal governments and the United States government use 'Indian'.

128
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,569
The Bureau of Indian Affairs, staffed by Indians, which mediates

129
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,109
between the two governments also uses 'Indian'. 

130
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,639
To call governments and departments and laws by names

131
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,859
other than what they are would be pointlessly confusing.

132
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,729
Three.  At the time of writing, 'Indian' is used by Indians

133
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,499
on Indian reservations to describe themselves.

134
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,419
Ok.
[hands clap]
We're well past that point where you hear a word

135
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,899
so many times it starts to become meaningless.

136
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,719
Fun fact.  There's a word for that: semantic satiation. 

137
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,369
Delightfully alliterative and will cause itself,

138
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,689
but I leave that as an exercise to the viewer.

139
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,349
This has been 1300 words in an attempt to explain 1.

140
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,309
That complete we can now move on to the next part.

141
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:46,733
[gentle campfire folk fiddle music fades slowly]
