00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,139
Hello, internet.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,699
Let's talk about this map,
this argument,

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,839
and the Electoral College in general.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,879
In my “Trouble With The Electoral College”
video from 2011,

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,239
I was wrong to use the city limits
for that part of the argument,

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,959
rather than the more expansive metro area.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,659
The lawyerish nerd inside of me still wants to argue
“technically correct” on that one.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,879
I used the city boundaries because
the metro areas are often vague and absurdly large:

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,199
the New York City metro area is
6700+ mi² over four states, and

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,259
from where I partly grew up,
it seemed that a lot of that area

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,779
had nothing to do with 
New York City proper.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,919
So, at the time,
I disregarded the metro boundaries.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,379
But using the strict city boundaries in that video
was the wrong decision in retrospect.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,959
In addition to being a bad argument to make,

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,699
it also doesn't address
the concerns this map expresses.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,059
And this is correct! Half the population
does live in the grey counties.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,519
And more than that, the map gets at a fundamental
division in the United States and other countries

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,219
that leads partly to the politics we see:

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,099
the difference between the rural and the urban.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,759
If trends continue, a higher and higher percentage
of the country will live in urban areas.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,079
In another eight or sixteen years,
this map will be even more extreme:

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,559
the metro areas even denser.

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,099
Which, if you're in favour of the Electoral College,

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,999
will seem like even more of a reason to keep it.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,559
Now this is where we must discuss the idea
that the Electoral College

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,619
ensures the president is elected by the states.

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,619
It doesn't.

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,939
A candidate can win the Electoral College
with just the eleven biggest states

29
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,959
This collection may seem unlikely, but as urbanization
and the politics it creates continues,

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,219
it becomes increasingly likely.

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,859
The Electoral College doesn't ensure
the president wins with a lot of states,

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,179
or even geographically diverse states.

33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,639
Now, "Should the president represent the people,
or should the president represent the states?"

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,019
is a question without an answer.

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,419
This is about preference in style of governance.

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,379
One moves power up to the federal level,
and the other moves power down to the states.

37
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,979
And given the vastness of the country
and the difference in her geographies,

38
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,119
it's reasonable to believe that
states with greater power is the better,

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,539
less divisive solution
to the problem of governance.

40
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,019
But the Electoral College
does nothing to help that.

41
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,239
It happens to be that recent wins
have been geographically spread,

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,739
but the Electoral College
doesn't ensure that outcome.

43
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,359
Cram everyone into California,
leaving one person in each state,

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,859
and the Electoral College says:
“California alone, she decides.”

45
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,339
We could have a system where
the president must win a majority of the states,

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,519
which is what some think
the Electoral College is... but it isn't.

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,199
The election only happens
to make it look that way.

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,219
The protection of the Electoral College
is only an illusion.

49
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,539
Even if you still like the Electoral College,

50
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,979
though it doesn't actually
protect the small states,

51
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,439
the Electoral College still comes with
the most bitter of anti-republic pills.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,579
For even if you win
the election in November,

53
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,819
your victory can be taken away
from you in December.

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,899
The Electoral College votes your state gets
aren't really votes,

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,999
but are individual members
of the political parties,

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,699
who perform the real vote for president in December.

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,639
No citizen voted for these electors
to cast a vote on their behalf,

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,779
and many of the electors
are free to vote for whoever they want.

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,679
Their election in December is the real election.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,599
The Electoral College was designed to be able
to overwrite the will of the people,

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,999
or its own election process,

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,979
any time enough of a small number of
unknown, unelected political party insiders

63
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,359
don't like the result they got.

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,479
If you're in favor of the Electoral College,

65
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,519
you have to accept that,
by its own rules,

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,399
it can take away your victory,

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,079
under the guise of
protecting you from yourself.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,939
This has never happened in American history,
nor should it.

69
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,219
But it is crazy to leave in place
for future elections

70
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,278
a system that benefits no citizens

71
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,199
and protects no states.

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,939
It's time to get rid of the Electoral College
and have a real discussion about

73
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,580
what a modern government and election system
should look like.
