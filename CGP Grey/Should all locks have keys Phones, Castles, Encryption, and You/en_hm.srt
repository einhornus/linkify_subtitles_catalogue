00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,139
Hello Internet. We need to talk about locks

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,279
The physical and the digital.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,619
In the physical world, locks aren't as good as you think they are.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,899
The lock on your door stops worries, not burglars,

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,319
As two minutes of searching will reveal.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,299
Spend more, get more; but all fail with tools and time enough.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,119
That physical locks are bad at locking mostly doesn't matter in normal life,

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,179
Because burglars are constrained by the physical world.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,539
A burglar must cruise the neighborhood, spending their time to pick a target,

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,439
Which makes a house that looks secure most of the way toward being secure.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,659
Each target house can then only be attacked one at a time,

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,599
And comes with a risk of being physically caught in the act.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,039
But digital is different. The constraints of the physical no longer apply.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,099
On the Internet, a digital lock must protect you from, not just the neighborhood burglar,

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,039
But all burglars everywhere. For, on the Internet, there's no such thing as distance.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,799
Internet burglars don't crack digital locks personally, they build burglar bots

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,679
That try millions of combinations just to see what opens.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,859
One lock down the street or a country-full on the other side of the world — it's all the same.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,719
Actually, other side of the world is better — a dude in East-whatever-landia stealing your identity

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,539
Has a near-zero chance of getting caught.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,379
This is bad news, but thanks to mathematics, digital locks can be made unbreakable.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,739
This is encryption — a digital lock that, without the password, cannot be opened.

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,419
Burglar bots will plough through all the possibilities, but a secure password

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,719
Will take longer than the heat death of the Universe to guess.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,839
No password, no entry. No matter how much of a l33t hacker your mom is

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,299
Your private files stay private.

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,659
Which might just be the greatest social good mathematics has done mankind.

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,259
But it's easy to imagine unbreakable digital locks as bad news.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,899
Maximum lazy: ticking time bomb, the location and off-code of which

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,299
Are locked on the phone of a dead man.

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,699
Now, were the information on a piece of paper in a safe room, no problem:

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,739
In the physical world, if you can't crack the lock, then you crack the wall.

33
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,819
Society agrees, under this scenario, it's reasonable for police to get in, no matter what it takes.

34
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,739
Note: this means real-world locks aren't just physically weak, but also legally weak.

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,499
We could live in a world with privacy laws that forbade police to break into all locks,

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,759
no matter how flimsy, but we don't, because that would be dumb.

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,759
Hmmm...

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,219
This is where gears turn in government heads.

39
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,939
If digital locks are physically invulnerable, maybe they can be made legally vulnerable:

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,219
To require digital locks be built with a keyhole for which police have the key.

41
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,599
Highly secure, top secret, for emergencies only, surely.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,199
This legal vulnerability to ban citizens from owning perfect digital locks,

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,759
To require companies manufacture their devices with keyholes, is an idea

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,219
That many, many governments are interested in.

45
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,559
And governments point out that a warrant which lets police into your house and into your papers

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,579
Should let police into your phone.

47
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,459
If your home is your castle, but the need, pressing enough, the police bring a battering ram.

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,179
But there's no battering ram to crack open a well-locked phone to comply with a warrant.

49
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,599
Not helpfully, anyway.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,119
Which is a problem: again, we all ideally want police to crack digital locks sometimes.

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,159
But at our current level on the tech tree, digital locks that cannot be opened are a thing that exists.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,779
And because they are made of math, something a skilled coder can build at home,

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,999
Trying to ban digital locks for everyone is pretty close to trying to ban an idea.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,539
Good luck with that.

55
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,499
But even were it possible to successfully ban perfect digital locks in a country, remember:

56
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,259
On the Internet, there is no such thing as distance.

57
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,859
Even if your government is a Xanadu bureaucracy of the Seraphim Incorruptible,

58
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,479
There are demons elsewhere.

59
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,259
Unbreakable digital locks are the foundation upon which computing and Internet-ing is built.

60
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,999
Banking, buying, blogging, vlogging, gaming, tweeting, beating, meeting —

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,339
All of this is possible because of unbreakable digital locks.

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,299
They've existed since computers filled rooms, but now, with computers in our pockets,

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,299
We rely on those locks to protect the content of our lives — the content of our minds.

64
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,919
Forced weakness, even with the best of intentions, places everyone in danger.

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,659
The nature of a keyhole is to be cracked,

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,299
And the nature of the Internet is to bring demons to the door.

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,359
No matter how much we might wish it, there is no way to build a digital lock

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,719
That only angels can open and demons cannot.

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,239
Anyone saying otherwise is either ignorant of the mathematics,

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,339
Or less of an angel than they appear.

This time, I'm going to recommend Daemon by Daniel Suarez.

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,779
I never like to say anything about fictional books, I don't like spoilers,

76
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,299
but if you've made it to the end of a video about encryption, this one's for you.
