00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,978
Hello Internet

2
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:05,059
The UK had an election we need to talk about
because after the debates finished, the people

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,778
voted and the ballots tallied the results
were this:

4
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:10,259
But parliament ended up looking like this:

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,899
Which isn't, exactly, representative. And
by not exactly, I mean at all.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,608
Red earned 30% of the vote and 36% of the
seats, which is sort of close, but the rest

7
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:24,698
is madness: Orange earned 8% of the vote but
got one eighth of that while Yellow's 5% just

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,278
about doubled, and purple earned 13% and got
squat.

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,669
Meanwhile blue's 37% of the people booted
to 51% of the seats in parliament. The blue

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,869
boost is even bigger when you consider that
51% of the seats gives basically 100% the

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,799
control.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,529
How'd this happen?

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,049
In the UK -- national elections aren't really
national, they're a bunch of local elections.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,709
The UK is divided into constituencies, each
of which elects one member of parliament (M.P.)

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,218
to represent them. This local / national divide
is where the trouble begins.

16
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:58,339
Imagine a parliament with just three constituencies,
and it's easy to see how it wouldn't always

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,159
align with citizens. Some people think this
sort of result is fine -- “it's all *about*

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,199
winning local elections,” they’ll say.
“Each M.P. represents their constituency.”

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,919
And while the imbalance in this example is
extreme, but it's the same problem in the real

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,429
election and this same argument is given,
but there are two more problems with it in

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,539
reality land.

22
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,118
1) Few citizens have any idea who their MP
is, they just know what party they voted for

23
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,959
-- what party they want to represent their
views on the national level. And pretending

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,749
like it's a local election is a bit disingenuous.
-- in practice it's an election for how the

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,429
nation will run -- not really for who is going
to represent a tiny part of it.

26
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,099
and even if it were

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,898
2) The individual constituencies are worse
at representing their citizens than parliament.

28
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:46,449
Indulge this spreadsheet-loving nerd for a
moment, will you?

29
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,849
The difference between what a party earned
at the polls and what they got in parliament

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,589
is the amount of misrepresentation error.

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,669
If we calculate all the errors for all the
parties and add them up we can say the Parliament

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,489
as a whole has 47% percentage points of misrepresentation
error. That sounds bad looks like a utopian

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,738
rainbow of diversity compared to any local
election because the local elections have

34
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:17,669
*one* winner. Out of the 650 constituencies
647 have a higher representation error than

35
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,429
parliament. These are the only three that
don't and they're really unusual for having

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,269
so many of a single kind of voter in one place.

37
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,458
Most places look the The Wrekin which is dead
in the middle a mere one-hundred and one points

38
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,199
off. Note that the winning candidate didn't
reach a majority here. Which means more than

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,469
half of constituencies elected their MP with
a minority of voters.

40
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,659
The worst is Belfast South at the bottom of
the list. Hilariously unrepresentative. Less

41
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,909
than a quarter of the voters get to speak
for the entire place in parliament. This is

42
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,119
the the lowest percentage an M.P. has ever
been elected by.

43
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,818
So when people argue that the UK election
is a bunch of local elections 1) people don't

44
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,639
act like it, and 2) It's even more of an argument
that the elections are broken because they're

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,139
worse on this level.

46
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,149
These local elections are unrepresentative
because of the terrible 'First Past the Post'

47
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,809
voting system -- which I have complained mightily
about and won't repeat everything here -- go

48
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,318
watch the video -- but TL;DR it only 'works'
when citizens are limited to two choices.

49
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,719
Voting for any party except the biggest makes
it more likely the biggest will win by a minority

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,059
-- which is exactly what happened.

51
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,119
That citizens keep voting for smaller parties
despite knowing the result is against their

52
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,619
strategic interests demonstrates the citizenry
wants diverse representation -- but that successes

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,298
is the very thing that's made this the most
unrepresentative parliament in the history

54
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,939
of the UK.

55
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,089
People happy with the results argue the system
is working fine -- of course they do. Their

56
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,939
team won.

57
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,539
But Government isn't a sport where a singular
'winner' must be determined. It's a system

58
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,229
to make rules that everyone follows and so,
we need a system where everyone can agree

59
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,048
the process is fair even if the results don't
go in their favor.

60
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,298
If you support a system that disenfranchises
people you don't like and turbo-franchises

61
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,339
people you do -- then it doesn't look like
you support representative democracy, it looks

62
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,279
like you support a kind of dictatorship lite.
Where a small group of people (including you)

63
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,189
makes the rules for everyone.

64
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:22,739
But as it is now, on election day the more
people express what they want the worse the

65
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:30,119
system looks which makes them disengaged at
best or angry at worst and GEE I CAN'T IMAGINE

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,499
WHY.

67
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,309
This is fixable, there are many, many better
ways the UK could vote -- here are two that

68
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,159
even keep local representatives.

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,719
And fixing voting really matters, because
this is a kind of government illegitimacy

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,989
score -- and it's been going up and may continue
to do so unless this fundamentally broken

71
00:04:47,990 --> 00:05:00,500
voting system is changed.
