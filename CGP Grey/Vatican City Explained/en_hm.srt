1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,539
Vatican City: capitol of the Catholic Church,
home to the pope, owner of impressive collections

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,029
of art and history all contained within the
borders of the world's smallest country: conveniently

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,239
circumnavigateable on foot in only 40 minutes.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,979
Just how did the world end up with this tiny
nation?

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,078
The short answer is: because Mussolini and
the long answer is fiendishly complicated

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,198
so here's a simplified medium version:

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,668
The popes used to rule a country called the
Papal States that covered much of modern day

8
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:25,668
Italy.

9
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:28,959
It was during this 1,000+ year reign that
the Popes constructed St. Peter's Basilica

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,198
the largest church in the world -- and also
built a wall around the base of a hill known

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,448
as Vatican upon which St. Peter's Stood.

12
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:39,319
But the Kingdom of Italy next door thought
Rome would be an awesome capital for their

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,829
country and so conquered the Papal States.

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,828
His nation destroyed the Pope hid behind the
walls of Vatican and conflictingly refused

15
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:49,949
to acknowledge that the Kingdom of Italy existed,
while simultaneously complaining about being

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,099
a prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy -- which
according to him didn't exist.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,959
Rather than risk religious civil war by getting
rid of the pope the Kingdom of Italy decided

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,728
to wait him out assuming he'd eventually give
up -- but religion is nothing if not obstinate

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,439
-- and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 popes and sixty years
later nothing had changed.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,969
Which brings us to Benito Mussolini the then
prime minister of Italy who was tired of listing

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,119
to the Pope complain to Italian Catholics
about his self-imposed imprisonment so Mussolini

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,999
thought he could score some political points
by striking a deal which looked like this:

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,549
1) Italy gave the land of Vatican to the Pope.

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,549
and…

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,379
2) Italy gave the Pope a bunch of apology
money

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,379
In return

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,529
1) The Pope acknowledged that Italy existed
and

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,529
and…

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,839
2) The Pope promised to remain neutral in
politics and wars.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,209
On the off chance that, you know, Mussolini
thought this might be a thing.

31
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,189
The deal was signed and a new country, Vatican
City was born.

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,879
And today the tiny nation on a hill has all
the things you'd expect of a country: its

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,799
own government that makes its own laws that
are enforced by its own police, who put people

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,279
who break them in its own jail.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,389
It also has its own bank and prints its own
stamps and issues its own license plates,

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,909
though only its citizens can drive within
its borders presumably because of terrible,

37
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,819
terrible parking -- and as the true mark of
any self-respecting nation: it has its own

38
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,799
top-level domain: .VA

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,429
But, despite all these national trappings
Vatican City is not really like any other

40
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,429
country.

41
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,189
Hold on to your fancy hat, because it's about
to get weird:

42
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,059
To understand the Vatican: there are two people
and two things that you need to know about:

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,599
the famous pope, the incredibly confusing
Holy See, The Country of Vatican City and

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,409
along with that the almost completely unknown
King of Vatican City.

45
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,529
But first the Pope: who gets a throne to sit
upon and from which he acts as the Bishop

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,529
for all the Catholics in Rome.

47
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,169
Actually all Bishops in the Catholic Church
get their own thrones but because the Bishop

48
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,009
of Rome is also the Pope his thrown is special
and has it's own special name: The Holy See.

49
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,859
Every time a Pope dies or retires there is
a sort of game of thrones to see which of

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,609
the bishops will next get to occupy the Holy
See.

51
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,539
So while Popes come and go the throne is eternal.

52
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,609
As such the name The Holy See not only refers
to the throne but also all the rules that

53
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,919
make the Catholic Church the Catholic Church.

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,999
When Mussolini crafted that aforementioned
deal, technically he gave the land of Vatican

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,889
City to The Holy See -- which, believe it
or not, is a legal corporate person in international

56
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,889
law.

57
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,879
Basically every time you hear the words The
Holy See think Catholic Church, Inc of which

58
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,449
the Pope is the CEO.

59
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,739
Now back to the King.

60
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,219
The King of Vatican City has absolute, unchecked
power within the country's borders and his

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,619
presence makes Vatican City one of only six
remanning absolute monarchies in the world,

62
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,009
including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
and Swaziland.

63
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,689
The King's absolute power is why Vatican City
can't join the European Union because only

64
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,059
democracies are allowed.

65
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,819
Through Vatican City does, strictly speaking,
have a legislative brach of government -- staffed

66
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,129
by cardinals, appointed by the pope -- the
King of Vatican City can overrule their decisions

67
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,129
and at any time for any reason.

68
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,059
So why do you never hear about the King of
Vatican City?

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,779
Because though King and Pope are two different
roles, they just happen to be occupied by

70
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,659
the same person at the same time -- which
has the funny consequence that, because the

71
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,649
Pope is elected and the King is all-powerful
but they're the same guy it makes Vatican

72
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,929
City the world's only elected, non-hereditary
absolute monarchy.

73
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,119
It's this dual-role that makes untangling
Vatican City so difficult because the Pope,

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,299
depending on the situation either acts as
The King of the country of Vatican City or

75
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,029
the Pope of the Holy See.

76
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,029
Got it?

77
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,029
No?

78
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,029
OK, here's an analogy:

79
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,769
Imagine if a powerful international company,
say Grey Industries, had a CEO who convinced

80
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,438
the United States to give one of its islands
to the Company which then made the island

81
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,779
into a new country -- Greytropolis -- with
an absolute monarchy as its government and

82
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,848
the law that the King of Greytropolis is,
by definition, the CEO of Grey Industries.

83
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:31,099
It's pretty obvious at that point that the
CEO should move his corporate headquarters

84
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,568
to the new nation -- so that the laws of the
country can benefit the company and the company's

85
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,899
global reach can benefit the country.

86
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,609
As for the man in the middle sometimes it's
good to the the CEO and sometimes it's good

87
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,929
to be the king.

88
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,878
That is essentially Vatican City.

89
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,549
But if you're still confused, don't worry
even other countries can't keep it straight.

90
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,769
For example the United Nations has The Holy
See the corporation as a member but not Vatican

91
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,568
City the actual country.

92
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:59,568
And The Holy See gives passports to Vatican
City citizens that other countries accept

93
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:03,179
even though those passports come from a company,
not a country.

94
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,909
And speaking of Vatican City citizens, they
are perhaps the strangest consequence of the

95
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,739
Pope's dual role as religious leader and monarch.

96
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,788
While other countries mint new citizens with
the ever popular process of human reproduction

97
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:16,649
Vatican City does not.

98
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,088
No one in Vatican City is born a citizen -- and
that's not just because, within a rounding

99
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,239
error, there are no female Vaticans.

100
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,869
The only way to become a citizen is for the
King of Vatican City to appoint you as one.

101
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,489
And the King only appoints you a citizen if
you work for the Pope -- who is also the King.

102
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,859
And because the King is all-powerful your
citizenship is at his whim.

103
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,629
If you quit your job for the Pope, the King
-- who is also the pope -- will revoke your

104
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,629
citizenship.

105
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,119
These rules mean that Vatican City doesn't
have a real permanent population to speak

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,388
of: there are only about 500 full citizens
-- which is fewer people that live in single

107
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,408
skyscrapers in many countries -- and all these
citizens work for The Holy See as either Cardinals

108
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:58,478
or Diplomats or the Pope's bodyguards or other
Catholic-related jobs.

109
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,749
So it's best to think of Vatican City as a
kind of Sovereign Corporate Headquarters that

110
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,329
grants temporary citizenship to its managers
rather than a real city-state like Singapore:

111
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,329
which has a self-reproducing population of
citizens engaged in a variety of economic

112
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,348
activities both of which Vatican City lacks.

113
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,158
But in the end, the reason the world cares
about Vatican City is not because of the citizens

114
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:21,469
within its walls but because of the billion
members of its church outside those walls.
