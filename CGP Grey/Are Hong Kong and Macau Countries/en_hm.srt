00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,549
# China, Hong Kong & Macau, Oh My!

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,819
Welcome to Hong Kong: the island city of China
packed with seven million people at unbelievable

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,819
density.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,749
But if you, dear tourist, start from Victoria
Harbor and head toward the mainland you'll

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,889
find that while Hong Kong is China she doesn't
act like it.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,579
To cross the bridge your passport must be
checked and stamped and checked and stamped.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,748
Not because you're a suspicious foreigner:
Mainland Chinese can't just stroll across

8
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:22,028
either, but rather because Hong Kong has her
own immigration policy.

9
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,118
And Hong Kong isn't the only isolated island,
there's nearby Macau with her own passport-checking

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,159
bridge and a ferry between them -- which also
checks passports.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,959
Travel from Hong Kong to Macau to the mainland
and back and you'll end up with three stamps,

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,929
and that goes for everyone: Hong Kongese can't
just live in Macau and Macanese can't just

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,629
live in Hong Kong and they both can just live
on the mainland.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,169
Yet it's all China.

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,828
And inconvenient travel isn't the only speciality
of these sister islands.

16
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:45,828
They also have:

17
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,078
* Separate governments and political parties.

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,078
* Separate police.

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,078
* Separate money.

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,078
* Postal systems.

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,078
* Schools.

22
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,078
* and languages.

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,639
Hong Kong even has her own Olympic team which
competed in the 2008 *Beijing* olympics which

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,599
doesn't make any kind of sense.

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,078
The only things these sister islands don't
have that other countries do:

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,238
1) Their own armies.

27
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:03,979
Though that isn't unique with modern countries,
and…

28
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,899
2) Formal diplomatic relations.

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,339
Though even this unclear as both are members
of international trade organizations.

30
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,289
And other countries have 'embassies' in Hong
Kong and Macau, sure China won't let them

31
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,969
be called embassies, those are only for **mighty
Beijing** -- they're called *consulates* even

32
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,339
if they're bigger than Beijing's embassy.

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,089
All this makes Hong Kong and Macau, as mentioned
in a previous video, the most country-like

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,999
countries that aren't countries.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,539
So why are they China?

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,559
China says so.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,279
It's called 'One China, Two Systems' -- though
fast-counters in the audience will see it

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,559
should be called 'One China, *Three* Systems.

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,889
Also there's China's special economic zones
(where capitalism runs free) making it more

40
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,659
like 'One China *Four* Systems' -- and if
China got her way it might be 'One China,

41
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,659
*Five* Systems'.

42
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,548
But we can't talk about everything so back
to China, Hong Kong, and Macau (oh my!)

43
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:49,669
China ended up having these two essentialy
city-states, as always, because Empire.

44
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,139
Portugal showed up in Asia in the 1500s and
didn't exactly make friends.

45
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,859
China and Portugal skirmished until Portugal
used Bigger-pile-of-money diplomacy to bribe

46
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,589
a local Chinese official into turning over
the islands of Macau as a trading port.

47
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,519
Later, Britannia found China and discovered
she had many of lovely things like silks and

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,948
porcelain and precious, precious tea that
Britannia craved.

49
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,249
In return China wanted from Britannia… to
be left alone and Britannia nobly agreed to

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,409
respect China's independence and soverenty.

51
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,409
OOPS!

52
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,409
OPIUM WARS!

53
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,999
Nothing generates demand like addiction -- which
Britannia was happy to supply.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,429
And, her bigger-gun diplomacy secured Hong
Kong as a base through which the drugs must

55
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,429
flow.

56
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,249
Later in a world where telegraphs and lightbulbs
were newfangled a lease gave control of Hong

57
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,059
Kong to Britannia for 99 years or quote "as
good as forever", kicking the transfer problem

58
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,568
down the generations to be delt with by the
unimaginably futuristic society of the 1990s.

59
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,809
Thus these sister cities grow up under the
influence of their Emperiffic parents.

60
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,399
Hong Kong had English common law and lived
in Britannia's org chart as one of her many

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,099
crown colonies and Macau had Portuguese civil
law.

62
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,379
And the parental effect is still seen today:
visit Hong Kong and she is clearly Britannia's

63
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,339
daughter what with her love of business and
international finance (and lasers!) and english-accented

64
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,429
language and near-identical transport system.

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,739
Macau had a more troubled adolescence, as
her bigger sister stole the spotlight with

66
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,839
her trading skills.

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,209
But Macau eventually grew up to be the gambling
capital of the world.

68
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,079
She's Las Vegas x10 with a mixture of Portugal
and China.

69
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,679
But Empires come and empires go, and the 90s
eventually arrived, meaning Britannia's lease

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,779
expired.

71
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,818
Portugal claimed the treaty gave her control
of Macau *forever* but China disagreed and

72
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,589
the UN was in a no-empires-no-longer mood,
and frankly had Portugal complained too much,

73
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,068
China could have used her own bigger-army
diplomacy at this point to resolve the situation.

74
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,369
So the transfer was going to happen: but the
world was nervous about China, what with the

75
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,739
*lingering communism* and all, so the deal
was the Empire's daughters would go *but*

76
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,429
they had to remain basically independent,
to which China agreed as long as everyone

77
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,179
else agreed to call them China.

78
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,239
The situation was a bit like if the US had
to give Alaska back to Russia and Russia *super*

79
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,389
promised to leave Alaska self-governing.

80
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,569
You couldn't blame the locals for being nervous.

81
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,969
But, unlike what you'd expect in this case
China has mostly left the little sister islands

82
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,969
alone.

83
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,979
So everything is dandy...

84
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,979
*however*...

85
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,009
The handover came with its own version of
the as-good-as-forever clause.

86
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,509
China didn't agree to leave Hong Kong and
Macau alone *for all time*, only fifty years,

87
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,559
again passing political problems to a future
generation.

88
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,708
(Hopefully one that's actually unimaginably
futuristic this time).

89
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,828
Anyway, assuming such provincial concerns
as these are not rendered irrelevant by the

90
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,198
singularity, what happens in the 2040s?

91
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,058
Will Hong Kong and Macau remain tiny city-states
or will they lose their independence and be

92
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,058
absorbed?

93
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:31,300
Only China knows, and China does not say.
