# Q&A with Grey `#2 (One Million Subscribers)

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,089
Hi.

3
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,858
So I think this is the part where I'm supposed
to have a dramatic opening, perhaps the 2001

4
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:11,779
theme song playing in the background as the
number 1,000,000 fades into view, but obviously

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,439
that's not happening.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,878
Don't get me wrong, I'm lucky that so many
people want to watch my videos. It's just

7
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,559
that one million is a number too large to
be comprehended with a monkey-derived brain.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,949
To try and have it feel more real I've takes
some YouTube data and made a spreadsheet!

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,449
(I make lots of spreadsheets)

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,549
You can select your country and enter the
population of the city where you live, and

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,089
it will spit out the statistically approximate
number of other people in that city who are

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,589
subscribed to this channel.

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,889
Doing that for London shows there are about
9,000 people in the city who are subscribers.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,039
Now 9,000 is obviously smaller that one-*million*
but it's a number with constraints and is

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,989
small enough to possibly be understood while
still large enough to be very intimidating.

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,009
So, if you're interested, you can click here
to play around with the spreadsheet. Now,

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,999
as promised: on to the Q&A.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,639
## What do you like most about being a YouTuber?
--Conzo_K

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,988
The best thing about this strange new world
is the people I've met -- which is quite the

20
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,209
statement for a social recluse to make. All
these guys are amazing to talk with and I

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,319
feel very lucky that I get the occasional
chance to do so.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,109
## What's the biggest change of opinion you've
had? --Steam23

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,889
That's a little too personal to share with
say, one-*million* people, but I do want to

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,999
talk about the importance of being able to
change your mind in general.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,809
The trick is to keep your identity separate
from your opinions -- they are objects in

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,669
a box you carry with you and should be easily
replaceable if it turns out they're no good.

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,739
If you think that the opinions in the box
are *who you are* then you'll cling to them

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,879
despite any evidence to the contrary.

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,419
Bottom line: If you want to always be right,
you need to always be prepared to change your

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,879
mind.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,118
## Were you trying to create a unique aesthetic
by using stick-figures? --Waggles_ 20

32
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,779
No it's just that I can't draw.

33
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,769
## After moving to London how long did it
take until you stopped saying 'Math' and started

34
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,699
saying 'Maths'? --brockheinz

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,339
I haven't -- I'm sticking with 'math'.

36
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,749
Americans living in the UK often end up with
an unfortunate accent I call 'psuedo-british'.

37
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,379
I try very hard to avoid this, but when you've
spend the majority of your talking time with

38
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,798
British people over a decade it's impossible
to completely fight the creeping pseudo-british

39
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,548
accent no matter how abhorrent you think it
makes you sound.

40
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,548
## Did your students know about your YouTube
channel? --qiyitam

41
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,419
I would never talk about it, but I know some
of them knew. However it's impossible to express

42
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,609
how little they cared. My classes were like
not hour-long CGP Grey videos.

43
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,488
## Would you like to see the interrobang more
widely adopted? --aaronboardley

44
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,218
Who wouldn'tâ€½

45
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,869
## Why don't you have an upload schedule?
--ManavT

46
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,848
Right: the big question. Usually phrased in
the YouTube comment section as 'y u no make

47
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:18,938
moar vids'?

48
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,468
So on average over the past couple of years
I've posted a 'Grey Explains' video about

49
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:27,918
every five weeks, which means if I could switch
to a weekly schedule my income would *quin*tupple.

50
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,009
Trust me, I would if I could.

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,218
I've talked before about how long it takes
to make these videos, but one of the other

52
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,638
problem I haven't mentioned is the failure
rate of projects.

53
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,248
For every video you see there's at least two
or three that didn't make it.

54
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:43,878
Most of the time that's just a lost afternoon
of working on an idea before realizing it's

55
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,259
a dud, but sometimes it's weeks before a fatal
flaw reveals itself -- sometimes I'll discover

56
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,979
too late a central fact of the video isn't
correct or, sometimes the whole script is

57
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,918
just unfixably *boring*.

58
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,729
Either way the decision to kill a video that
isn't working is depressing and frustrating

59
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,218
because of the sunk cost of all those hours.

60
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,858
The videos you see are (mostly) pretty good
precisely because I try my best to kill the

61
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:09,699
ones that weren't -- that's why there isn't
a schedule, and there never can be.

62
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,089
## What's the biggest video you killed? --tyroncs

63
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,808
The most time I lost was on an important video
to convince the world why *Settlers of Catan*

64
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,589
is the greatest board game ever made.

65
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,448
I had a couple thousand words as a starting
point, harassed people for footage of a now-famous

66
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:26,078
game that took place at YouTube EDU, got a
bunch of random videos from my ever-helpful

67
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,929
twitter followers had a and an outline for
a 'How to Play Settlers of Catan' tutorial

68
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,149
video for my second channel.

69
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,668
But the script kept growing and growing and
began to look more like a documentary film

70
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,668
on board game design than a YouTube video
-- which might, depending on who you are sound

71
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,479
really interesting, but it had the boring
problem I mentioned before.

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,649
My last ditch effort to save a project like
this is to get rid of everything, work on

73
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,848
something else for a few days, then write
a brand new script by hand -- which I did.

74
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:55,068
But that script still wasn't good and weeks
after starting the project I shelved it. But

75
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,598
I'm talking about it now because it's an idea
that I still just can't let go and might come

76
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,039
back to some day.

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,218
## Why don't you hire people to help you?
--WhoAteEarth

78
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:07,208
That's a big topic that deserves more time,
but for now let me just say the kind of work

79
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,548
produced by individuals is very different
than kind work of produced by groups. One

80
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,408
isn't intrinsically better than the other,
but I think the kinds of videos I've made

81
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:19,119
have all benefited from being a one-man project
from start to finish.

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,278
## Your opinion on koalas. --blanket_warrior

83
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,249
They sleep 20 hours a day -- never going to
be a koala-based civilization with that kind

84
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,229
of work ethic.

85
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,289
## If you could transfer your brain into a
robotic body, would you? --xyon21

86
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:28,999
Obviously yes.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,439
## You can add three amendments to the US
constitution. What do they do? --raloon

88
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,409
Oh, so many tempting changes to make. Off
the top of my head I'd say:

89
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,059
1. Abolish private funding of all elections
and instead make them run from a limited pool

90
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,959
of tax money.

91
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,739
2. Abolish the Senate and replace it with
some kind of proportional body.

92
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,909
3. Overturn the Interstate-commerce clause
-- which basically gives the federal government

93
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,119
too much power over the affairs of the States.

94
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,509
Of course, if it was actually my responsibility,
I'd consult with some experts rather than

95
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,459
just idly mull it over for a couple of days.

96
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,109
Running a country of 300 million is more complicated
than it looks.

97
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,049
## What advice you would give for a successful
life? --pringlesaddict99

98
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,249
Build a self-evaluation loop in your life.
If you don't periodically review your actions,

99
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,639
their effects and your decision-making process
there hope for improvement other than random

100
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,379
chance.

101
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,579
I do very small weekly reviews, and bigger
quarterly and yearly reviews of how my life

102
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,599
is going and how I might want it to be different
in both the biggest and smallest ways.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,949
That's the best, high level advice I have.
For more tactical advice I recommend two books:

104
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,329
one that changed my life *Getting Things Done*
by David Allen and another that might change

105
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,519
yours: *So Good They Can't Ignore You* by
Cal Newport. You can click those books to

106
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,638
read my reviews of them.

107
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,239
## Have you made a video you don't like how
it came out? --Gourounaki

108
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,059
With the exceptions of the 2012 and Holland
videos, I'm unhappy with *all of them*. I

109
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,859
don't watch my own videos after upload if
I can possibly avoid it: they're graveyards

110
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,209
of the could-have been.

111
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,259
## Favorite non-educational YouTube channels?
--DB101

112
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,479
1st: Glove and Boots, who I'm suprised haven't
yet gotten ALL THE SUBSCRIBERS. 2nd: I'm a

113
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,169
also huge fan of Yahtzee, the Roger Ebert
of video games.

114
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,319
## What was your first memory of the internet?
Mine is playing flash games. --vicorator

115
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,679
Mine is B.B.S.s. Now get off my lawn and go
watch this documentary you whippersnapper.

116
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,949
## Who are your heros? --reed17

117
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,369
Mostly Dark Seer and Necrolyte.

118
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,189
## What do you find hardest when making a
video? --willdood

119
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,189
Writing the script is the hardest and unfortunately
it's the bottleneck for the whole process.

120
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,559
The most *uncomfortable* part is editing the
audio. Just like everyone else there is a

121
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,909
voice in my head that I like and a voice on
the tape that I don't.

122
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,189
## Have any of your answers from your previous
Q&A changed? --MessiahPenguin

123
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,749
You're probably referring to these, and no.

124
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,529
## How long would you survive a zombie apocalypse?
--One_Wheel_Drive

125
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,419
I wouldn't. If a Walking-Dead-style zombie
apocalypse arrises the correct course of action

126
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,019
is suicide.

127
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,749
## What do you listen to while making videos?
--syphen94

128
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,729
My most reliable writing music is Girl Talk's
'All Day' which I would link to on YouTube

129
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,739
but it's copyright-infringement-tasktic. But
you can get it from his website and if you

130
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,319
like remixes you should give it a listen.

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,659
However, I often get some random terrible
song in my head while writing and end up buying

132
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,459
it and putting on repeat -- for hours. For
this script my iTunes reveals I listened to

133
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,439
a single song 127 times. That might be torture
in some jurisdictions but the repetitiveness

134
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,269
really zones me into writing.

135
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,529
Animating, however, is incredibly tedious
so I listen to a ton of podcasts and audiobooks

136
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,658
to keep my sanity.

137
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,919
## What's the most interesting 'could-have-been'
of history? --SCE-2-AUX

138
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,419
Historical-could-have-beens mostly strike
me as a missing-the-point thought exerciese.

139
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,409
The real driver of history is neither great
men nor the actions of the masses but the

140
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,699
ceaseless march of science and technology,
which is mostly indifferent to the imaginary

141
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,739
lines drawn by packs of monkeys.

142
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,349
Knowing my perspective you'll see why if I
*had* to pick one it would this primitive

143
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,329
greek steam engine invented 2,000 years ago.

144
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,919
There are reasons why it wasn't developed
further but if some rich Greek had gotten

145
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,799
obsessed with the technology perhaps we would
have had an industrial revolution two millennia

146
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,109
earlier and we'd now be a trans-galactic-post-singularity
civilization. With robot bodies.

147
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,199
## What is the most British thing you have
encountered that you can't get your head around?

148
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,539
--vikihogg

149
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,349
The idea that the best way to cool down on
a summer day while confined to a non-air-conditioned

150
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,559
office is to drink hot tea. Madness, absolute
madness.

151
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,279
## Should we create a universal language?
--vsa11

152
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,779
We already have, it's just not very universal.

## What question do you want me to ask the
most? --Gregorian_Hawke

154
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,509
Hmmmâ€¦

155
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,499
## I love your videos and have even watched
this somewhat tedious one until the very end.

156
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,859
How can I help support you? --Gregorian_Hawke

157
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,689
I'm glad you asked Gregorian_Hawke.

158
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,869
The best way is though a subscription at subbable
where you can get signed posters and other

159
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,949
stuff, and thereâ€™s also t-shirts and addiction
mugs (and flamethrowers) over at DFTBA.

160
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,399
Well Internet, it's been fun. And I'm sorry
if you're question didn't make it into this

161
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,718
video -- there were loads I had to cut -- but
now that we're in this realm of numbers so

162
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,327
big they don't make sense perhaps I'll turn
Q&A's into an occasional random thing rather

163
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,609
than a waiting for an arbitrary base ten roll
over thing.

164
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,628
Thank you again to everyone for your continued
support and thank you for subscribing and

165
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:47,509
for watching -- these last two years have
been quite a ride.
