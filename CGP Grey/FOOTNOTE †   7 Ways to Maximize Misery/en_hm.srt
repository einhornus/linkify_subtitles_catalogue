00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,079
For this main video,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,379
it's worth saying explicitly at the start

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,379
that the obvious actual goal

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,379
is to achieve happiness,

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,379
not misery.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,559
But you, like me,

7
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,559
might find the advice on happiness

8
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,079
kind of tiresome.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,419
Almost irritating.

10
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,479
So it might be more useful to think

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,659
about how to achieve the opposite.

12
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,819
And thus, to see how the actions we might

13
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,659
take work against us.

14
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,659
And happiness is a topic that is

15
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,359
unusually well-suited to this mental inversion.

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,499
My dear viewers,

17
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,179
do not take the main video as literal advice.

18
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,819
I want all of you to find your own happiness.

19
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,699
And that's why I made this video.

20
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:42,219
Good luck.

21
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,399
Why are you still here?
