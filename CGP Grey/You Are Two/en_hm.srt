1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,779
Your brain is two brains.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,339
Two hemispheres each doing half the work of being you.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,119
Half your vision goes to each and half your movement directed by each.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,119
Right controls left

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,119
and left controls right.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,499
Your two brains co-ordinate through a wire of nerves, but

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,119
this wire can be cut, and was, for a time, used as an epilepsy treatment.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,919
After the cut, people seemed the same, though their brain was split in-twain.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,679
Except, some post-split patients described that while selecting their morning outfit with

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,658
right hand, left might come along to disagree.

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,219
Actually, left hand might quite often disagree, which these split-brain patients found frustrating.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,259
What's happening?

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,179
To investigate, remember, right brain sees and controls one half, while

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,559
left brain controls and sees the other.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,679
But only left brain can speak.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,319
"Hello."

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,119
Because that's where the speech center is located.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,339
Right brain, without this, is mute.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,639
In normal brains, this doesn't matter because each half communicates across the wire with the other.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,059
But, split-brains can't, and thus, you can show just the right brain a word, ask the person:

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,018
"What did you see?",

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,499
and you'll hear: "Nothing."

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,939
Because, left speaking brain saw nothing.

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,439
Meanwhile, right brain will use its hand to pick the object out of a pile hidden from left brain.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,519
This is deeply creepy.

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,679
Ask "Why are you holding the object?" and speaking left brain will make up a

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,079
plausible sounding, but totally wrong, reason.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,999
"I always wanted to learn how to solve one of these."

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,499
Left brain isn't lying; it's just doing what brains do:

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,979
creating a story that explains its past actions to its current self, a behavior which does rather cast doubt

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,099
onto the notion of free will (but that's a story for another time).

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,939
Creating reasons for why it does things is just something

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,959
left brains do.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,219
It happens in normal, healthy humans all the time, and if you think about it closely, you

35
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,159
know you've done this.

36
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,099
Back to experiments.

37
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,019
Give right brain an object, ask the person "What's in your hand?" and they won't be able to say.

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,939
"I'm not holding anything."

39
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,319
And, when asked to draw, a split-brain can draw two separate objects

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,119
simultaneously, with each hand, in a way unsplit-brains find challenging.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,639
These experiments on split-brain patients are deeply unsettling

42
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,979
because they really point in the direction of a mute separate... intelligence...

43
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,059
Something...

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,499
Living in the skull.

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,259
You can even ask questions of a split-brain and get disagreement on the answer.

46
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,799
So, if your brain is split, who is the 'you' in this situation?

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,219
From the outside, it's tempting to think of the part of the brain that's speaking as the person, but

48
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,939
something is hearing and answering questions.

49
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,499
And, though right brain can't speak, it does understand faces, which left brain can't.

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,299
If this is you, you don't know who your friends and family  are in a crowd.

51
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:49,039
This act of cutting exposes two minds in one head, and the talking mind

52
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,239
doesn't know there's someone else in the house.

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,599
The left brain can describe the situation it's in, but nonetheless will constantly be surprised by

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,999
right brain's actions and explain them away.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,179
There's a question to be asked here:

56
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,479
Why, after separation, does right brain not totally freak out, but instead plays

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,579
along helpfully, answering questions, and listening to left-brain's dumb stories about what's happening.

58
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,659
- It's the best pony... I don't know.

59
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,779
- Speculation time...

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:23,479
But, one answer is the cutting doesn't make right brain a separate... intelligence... consciousness... person?

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,479
but rather it has always been. In normal people, perhaps right brain rose up as a companion without a choice.

62
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,739
Feeling at first somewhat equal partners, but then, as speech develops that it can't participate in, that

63
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,899
increasingly becomes the central point of life, it resigns to mutely co-ordinate with left brain.

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,899
At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video:

65
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,159
one having a 'mind = blown' moment, and the other mentally rolling its eye at the obviousness of it all.

66
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,139
In split-brains, right doesn't freak out because not a whole lot has really changed.

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,199
You might not agree, and maybe arguing right now at why it can't be possible, exactly as we would expect

68
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,879
talking left brain to do.

69
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,619
Speculation aside, split-brain patients show, at the very least, that in the mind, there is a separate...

70
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,599
something that can hear and understand and respond, given the right circumstances.

71
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,759
Your brain isn't entirely yours.

72
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,999
Who is you?

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,119
You is two.

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,559
[soft music]

75
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,979
[Grey's voice morphing into Kurzgesagt's voice] But we can go deeper.  You are many.

76
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,919
[Kurzgesagt's voice] The pile of meat that's your body is made up of trillions of tiny individuals that have a life of their own.

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,759
[Kurzgesagt's voice] So, at which point do the many become one?

78
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,679
[Kurzgesagt's voice] What makes lots of tiny things you?

80
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,599
[Grey's voice] Seriously. If you haven't checked out Kurzgesagt, then you don't know what you're missing.

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,799
Kurgaset?

82
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,019
Kurtzgaset?

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,700
I never know.
