1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,439
"Challenge: can you post another Q&A
within six months?"

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,379
No. I cannot.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,779
"What are your favorite and least favorite
kinds of questions to answer?"

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,539
A long time ago, in a state far away

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,479
I did an event with some friends where my job
was to pick questions from the audience.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,199
Right before the show started, pretty Derek turned to me and said, "Please don't pick superlatives."

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,199
And I said, "What's a superlative?"

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,059
"Best, worst, favorite, least favorite"

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,079
"Aaaaah."

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,259
The show begins and those were probably
half the questions in the bowl.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,579
But Derek, having had much more experience
with Q&As, was totally right.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,039
On the spot those questions are pretty hard to answer.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,239
But also, as I've grown up, I've found the whole concept
of a favorite '$X' has become more...

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,239
...abstract, and situational.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,579
Favorite things seem to be more
important the younger you are,

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,359
which makes sense because you don't really know who
you are, and so define yourself by the world around you.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,659
And it's also practice for the tribal affiliation games
we NEVER escape even as adults.

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,519
Which can make trying to answer these questions super
unfun when people take the answer

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,119
waaaay too seriously.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,779
So a question about my favorite is by far my least favorite, but Fahrenheit is still my favorite.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,539
Come at me!

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,839
Anyway, if you're ever at a show
or submitting questions to a Q&A,

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,379
to raise the odds of getting an answer, try turning it a bit.

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,639
For example: "Whose videos do you watch the most?"

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,439
That's an easy answer. RedLetterMedia by a mile.

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,579
I started with the highly produced gateway classics

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,359
and over the years progressed
to mainlining the hardcore stuff.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,579
It's hard to say why I so like watching guys I don't know
view movies and instructional videos ~I never will~

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,259
but it's strangely comforting and engaging.

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,439
And let's not talk about how many hundreds
of hours of RedLetterMedia I've had on

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,719
while animating since starting my own channel.

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,439
I'm glad YouTube doesn't track and timeshame
unlike some *other* services I could mention.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,719
I also picked this question because

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,099
I can't bear watching RedLetterMedia keep
inching closer to a million subscribers any longer.

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,059
Can we get these guys their gold play button already?
Click and subscribe.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,979
"What's your favorite joke you've hidden in a video?"

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,839
*hmmmm*

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,799
I'm gonna let this one slide because
oh man, do I love hiding stuff in videos!

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,479
And it brings me tremendous joy
when people find all the things!

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,259
For example, have you found all the bees?
There's a lot of them now.

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,419
Again, no *favorites*, but a recent one I'm pleased with

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,879
is this dude in the airport reading The Hobbit,

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,739
and then the Fellowship of the Ring
and then the entire Rings Trilogy.

44
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,019
Implying the wait to board that flight was really long.

45
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,919
"Favorite integer?"

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,759
No, I don't-

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,419
"Favorite colour?"

48
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,247
I-I shouldn't have-

49
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:20,268
"Favorite Magic colors?"

50
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:22,339
Well, black and blue obviously but-

51
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,999
"No getting around this one. Favorite Youtuber?"

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,619
You know, these people are my friends!
It would be really weird to pick a-

53
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,339
"Favorite podcast?"

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,639
No, I already explained-

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,259
"Favorite movie?"

56
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,599
"Favorite Liberian county flag?"

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,339
"Favorite world leader?"

58
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,699
You can't be serious-

59
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,648
"Favorite law of physics?"

60
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:34,559
"Favorite conspiracy theory?"

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,339
"Favorite tree?"

62
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,839
What!?

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,099
"On a scale of 1-10,
what is your favorite color of the alphabet?"

64
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,839
Ah, no, okay. This is my fault!
I shouldn't have opened this door-

65
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,339
"What is your favourite spelling of favorite?"

66
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,129
Okay, enough of ...

67
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,089
"What is the most persistent physical object you own?"

68
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,169
Ooh, that's a good question!
Like it must be my original wedding ring.

69
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,709
I can't think of an object that's been with me longer.

70
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,769
I currently wear a second edition, which will eventually
become the third most persistent object in my life.

71
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,589
*rings hit each other*

72
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,069
"What's the second most persistent?"

73
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,989
Well, while moving office recently, I found it
hiding in an envelope at the bottom of a box.

74
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,149
Sure I had thrown it away. Positive in fact!

75
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,369
But somehow this specter evaded
my many moves and purges.

76
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,309
I have NO idea how it shadowed me,
hiding nearby for a decade.

77
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,429
So to explain this thing. Back in the long ago,

78
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,189
I quit teaching, packed all my belongings,
bundled my savings, heading off into the sunset

79
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,829
with the sure knowledge I was
to achieve the project of my life.

80
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,009
To escape the system. To become self-employed.
To be free!

81
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,849
And I...

82
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,969
totally failed.
Burned through my savings and returned to London,

83
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,209
humbled having to find another teaching job.

84
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,249
That year of failure was not a great time

85
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,489
and what I thought would be my Mjolnir with which
to forge my new life was instead a cursed object.

86
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,529
This original MacBook Air!
The laptop sold on its thinness and lightness.

87
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,609
The machine I spent a significant
portion of my savings on

88
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,549
as it seemed perfect for the life
of peregrination before me.

89
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,869
This laptop was a disaster, with catastrophic
thermal problems making it run painfully slow.

90
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,689
And during this dark time I lived in Hawaii
with family to save money.

91
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,249
Now, Hawaii...

92
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,328
... doesn't believe in air conditioning. Because the island is 'paradise' and the weather is 'perfect'!

93
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,109
It isn't!

94
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:26,109
I have such a visceral memory of being
inescapably hot and sweaty trying to work

95
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,549
while heat poured out from the keyboard,
melting me... melting my dreams.

96
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,609
I thought I had long gotten rid of this totem
of the absolute failure of a younger man.

97
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,589
But it's weird! Now that it's been so long, I kind of want
to mount it on my office wall as #neverforget

98
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,749
I don't think I really will, but... I haven't thrown it out yet.

99
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,569
"What is one topic you will never discuss?"

100
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,329
How... am I to answer this question?

101
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,129
"Is there still hope for the Catan video?"

102
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,529
*Intense sounds*

103
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,029
...No.

104
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,589
"What are your tips on improving one's ability to read?"

105
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,469
Spend less time on the Tweetbooks and Snapstagrams.

106
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,449
I kind of left a lot of the internet...
Temporarily? A while back.

107
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,769
I don't know if you've heard. I've only made a vlog
and talked about it repeatedly on my podcasts.

108
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,889
Anyway, I think Internet comments train my brain
to have a short attention span.

109
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,469
So less of the Reddit = more of the books
which I think is a net positive.

110
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,649
But I do miss the Wild West of the Internets.

111
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,329
Sometimes I can hear the memes calling me.

112
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,189
Now, anything you want to have
more of in your life like reading,

113
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,629
also try to decide ahead of time what you're
going to have less of to make space for it.

114
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,249
Saying you want to do more X
without also saying what you want to do lessof

115
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,749
is a recipe for failure.
In life, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

116
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,829
"How come you don't mention D&D more often?"

117
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,769
Despite, as you might imagine, the child me
being right in the demographic for D&D,

118
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,389
I never played it!
So that's why I don't mention it.

119
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:56,669
The closest I ever got was baby's first D&D: HeroQuest,
which I loved playing as the dungeon master.

120
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,269
"Does it frustrate you how all the months have different numbers of days?"

121
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,669
It makes spreadsheets very untidy, so yes.

122
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,049
"Have any answers from the previous Q&As changed?"

123
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,349
Man, every time this gets asked I have
more videos to check.

124
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,629
This time through, I noticed I've previously
mentioned a proportional Senate

125
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,169
as one of my top three changes to the Constitution.

126
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,229
Which was totally surprising to current me to see.

127
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,969
Maybe past me meant a Senate run by MMP.
If so, I didn't make that very clear.

128
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,369
Anyway! I'm still pretty firmly against the
Electoral College, not because of the original idea

129
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,669
but because of what has changed in the last...
centuries.

130
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,669
But the House and Senate system
seems like a pretty good way to try to

131
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,969
balance the power of the states and the people.

132
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,449
"What's your favorite exit?"

133
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,829
The exit of my people: the Irish exit.

134
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,809
Goodbyes are uncomfortable.
When you're done, you're done!

135
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,849
Just go.......   *poof*

136
00:06:41,850 --> 00:07:02,480
