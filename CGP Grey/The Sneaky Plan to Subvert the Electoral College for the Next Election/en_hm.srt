1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,199
The Electoral College.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,809
America's unique way of picking her President.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,119
For it or against it, you might want to know there's a plan to use

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,759
the Electoral College to subvert the Electoral College.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,239
It's a sneaky plan and to understan(d), remember that:

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,579
while it feels like citizens pick the president in one big election,

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,249
they don't.

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,249
The 50 states pick the president.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,909
Oh and, District of Columbia.

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,279
But not you, Puerto Rico -- come back when you're a state.

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,989
How the states come together and how they vote is what the Electoral College is.

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,179
Each state gets votes proportional to her population (plus two)

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,899
and is free to cast these votes however she wants.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,609
Most look at how their citizens voted

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,779
and give all their Electoral College votes to the state-wide winner.

16
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,899
But they don't have to.

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,859
A couple states cast their votes proportional-ish to their citizens' preferences.

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,719
But states are free to vote however.

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,619
Including against the preferences of their citizens.

20
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,729
Let's make a note of that.

21
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,809
But back to this plus two, which is why some citizens *really* don't like the Electoral College.

22
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,739
The plus two means:

23
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,179
the states less populous produce preponderate presidential picking power per person.

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,569
At the extremes, some states get one vote per low hundred thousand people

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,839
and some states one vote per high hundred thousand.

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,799
This is how the Electoral College sometimes picks a president

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,339
that nationwide most citizens didn’t.

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,179
Because roughly 80% of the state votes are given by population and 20% aren't.

29
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,519
This is on purpose.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,059
Dividing power between the levels of citizen, state, and federal is

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,459
(and was) a central point of the Constitution.

32
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,109
It's a Compromistitution.

33
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,269
So if you went back in time to when the states

34
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,479
were about to finalize the deal, yelling:

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,549
(as Future Grey)
Don't sign that document.  I'm from the future.

36
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,069
You're creating an Electoral College where votes for president

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,279
are distributed proportionally-ish not *perfectly proportionally*.

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,239
(as present-day narrator Grey)
The reply would be:

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,229
(as New York girl)
Yes, that's one of the many compromises we agreed upon.

40
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,329
(as Future Grey)
But because of that sometimes a president will be elected with a minority of the popular vote!

41
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,999
(as New York girl)
Yes.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,749
(as Future Grey)
But the people…

43
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,809
(as Constitutional Convention)
The people?  You can't trust the people.

44
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,229
Do you think this Compromistitution is for a direct democracy lawl?

45
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,019
We're building a republic here.

46
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,729
(as Future Grey)
Yes, I know but would you just look at this spreadsheet of improportion--?

47
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,749
(as New Hampshire girl)
--How many states are there in the future?

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,559
(as Future Grey)
50… maybe 51 depending on how…

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,149
(as New York girl)
--Wow!  What a tremendous success!  Go Compromistitution!

50
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,129
(as Future Grey)
No, can we focus--

51
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,279
(as New York girl)
Do you even own land?

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,019
(as Future Grey)
No…

53
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,019
(as New York girl)
Then why would we listen to you?  Goodbye.

54
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,829
(as present-day narrator Grey)
Thus the Electoral College is doing what it was designed to do

55
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,079
(totally on purpose)

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,509
and the Supreme Court has reaffirmed this.

57
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,449
So if you don't like the Electoral College, then tough noogies for you.

58
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,949
And if you do, then nothing to worry about.

59
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,759
The Electoral College, in a fortress of axiomatic constitutionality,

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,299
has survived for a thousand generations of this republic.

61
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,409
The only way to break through the front gate would be with a constitutional amendment.

62
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,129
But getting enough states to push on the same side of that gromulent tool

63
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,819
(while not theoretically impossible)

64
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,319
is legislatively improbable.

65
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,319
This is where the sneaky plan comes in.

66
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,719
(Did you forget about that?  Don't worry, I got carried away.)

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,929
There is a back door that, if breached,

68
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,259
can turn the constitutional fortress protecting the Electoral College into a prison.

69
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,079
The sneaky plan is named: the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

70
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,749
It's a terrible name.

71
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,109
Probably on purpose to hide sneakiness behind boringness

72
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,319
as bureaucratic paperwork camouflage.

73
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,079
But I'm calling it NaPoVoInterCo.

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,309
Which is sort-of-not-really better, but whatever.

75
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,489
Here are the sneaky deets.

76
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,079
1. Assume destroying the constitutional protections

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,349
of the Electoral College is impossible.

78
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,749
Point 2 is the note from before that,

79
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,799
States can cast their Electoral College votes however they want.

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,229
These are just facts.

81
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,479
But if a state signs on the dotted line, Point 3 is the big deal:

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,499
NaPoVoInterCo members agree to cast their Electoral College votes

83
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,189
for the candidate who gets the most votes from citizens nationwide.

84
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,539
This is the “National Popular Vote” in NaPoVoInterCo.

85
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,999
The idea behind 2 plus 3 is to make it impossible to have a president

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,229
most of the citizens didn't vote for.

87
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,369
A state would look not only at the result in her borders,

88
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,209
but the results nationwide, and vote that way.

89
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,149
Which is all fine and dandy if the state citizens voted

90
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,889
with the majority anyway.

91
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,629
But if they didn't, well, you can see a flaw with the plan.

92
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,009
Any singular state assaulting the Electoral College on her own,

93
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,409
carrying votes against her own citizens,

94
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,129
it's political suicide from without and within.

95
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,179
So the plan, had it only three points,

96
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,969
is something no state would agree to, requiring one last sneak.

97
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,639
Point 4.

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,319
The plan does not go into effect until enough states, with enough votes

99
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,749
to control the Electoral College as a block, join.

100
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,169
So, as states sign up,

101
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,389
the total number of Electoral College votes they control goes up.

102
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,629
But nothing happens.

103
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,919
Elections pass and states still vote the traditional way,

104
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,979
while recruiting allies to the cause.

105
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,249
(as Electoral College)
What are you guys up to over there?

106
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,209
(as NaPoVoInterCo girls)
Oh us?  Nothing.

107
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,259
Just chilling.  Just hanging out.

108
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,779
(as present-day narrator Grey)
But once a controlling majority of Electoral College votes is reached,

109
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,699
Point 4 is satisfied and

110
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,359
-- when it's time for the next election --

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,939
CHARGE!

112
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,969
All together, all at once, in through the back,

113
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,669
the Electoral College is captured.

114
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,369
The fortress is now a prison.

115
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,769
From this moment on, the NaPoVoInterCo block promises

116
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,419
the candidate who gets the most citizen votes nationwide

117
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,919
gets their controlling majority and becomes the president.

118
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,919
Without amending the Constitution,

119
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,999
the Electoral College has become totally pointless

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,319
by using its protection of state's rights to vote however they want,

121
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,109
into the vital tool to functionally remove state votes entirely,

122
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,129
making the presidential election into one not of states, but of citizens.

123
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,979
And there's no problem with this plan at all.

124
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,879
Except, of course the instant this popular coup occurred,

125
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,949
states outside the compact will storm the Supreme Court,

126
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,989
who will then be forced to deal with everyone yelling

127
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,159
all at once about the future of how the president will be elected.

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,499
Which will be amazing to watch,

129
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,089
no matter which side the gavel of constitutional interpretation comes down upon.

130
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,939
That's the plan.

131
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:35,959
It's been around for a while
That's the plan.

132
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,059
It's been around for a while

133
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,899
and has enough confirmed signatures

134
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,459
to be more than half way to the trigger point.

135
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,919
And in theory, enough states have laws

136
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,849
currently pending in their legislatures, that if passed,

137
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,529
would put NaPoVoInterCo into action for the next election.

138
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,219
Though, of course, it's easier to agree to things

139
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,689
while they’re far away and uncertain to happen

140
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,689
and the reality of voting against your citizens merely theoretical.

141
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,119
So it may be much more difficult to get the final triggering two percent

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,039
than the promised first forty nine.

143
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,619
But the Electoral College, for it or against it,

144
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,249
the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is the sneaky plan to use it to subvert it.

145
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:34,020
