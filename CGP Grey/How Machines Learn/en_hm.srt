1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,019
On the internet, the algorithms are all around you.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,319
You are watching this video because an algorithm brought it to you (among others) to click,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,159
which you did, and the algorithm took note.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,659
When you open the TweetBook, A the algorithm decides what you see.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,959
When you search through your photos, A the algorithm does the finding.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,959
Maybe even makes a little movie for you.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,799
When you buy something, A the algorithm sets the price

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,999
and A the algorithm is at your bank watching transactions for fraud.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,179
The stock market is full of algorithms

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,739
trading with algorithms.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,239
Given this, you might want to know how these little algorithmic bots shaping your world work,

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,039
especially when they don't.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,079
In Ye Olden Days,

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,899
humans built algorithmic bots by giving them instructions the humans could explain.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,799
"If this, then that."

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,079
But many problems are just too big and hard for a human to write simple instructions for.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,559
There's a gazillion financial transactions a second, which ones are fraudulent?

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,979
There's octillion videos on NetMeTube.

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,679
Which eight should the user see as recommendations? Which shouldn't be allowed on the site at all?

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,219
For this airline seat, what is the maximum price this user will pay right now?

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,499
Algorithmic bots give answers to these questions.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,919
Not perfect answers,
but much better than a human could do.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,859
But how these bots work exactly,
more and more, no one knows.

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,919
Not even the humans who built them,

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,879
or "built them",

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,859
as we will see...

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,419
Now companies that use these bots
don't want to talk about how they work

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,819
because the bots are valuable employees.

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,299
Very, VERY valuable.

30
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,699
And how their brains are built is a fiercely guarded trade secret.

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,999
Right now the cutting edge is most likely very

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,639
'I hope you like linear algebra',

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,339
but what the current hotness is on any particular site

34
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,299
and how the bots work, 
is a bit "I dunno", and always will be.

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,599
So let's talk about one of the more quaint but understandable ways bots CAN be "built"

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,319
without understanding how their brains work.

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,239
Say you want a bot that can recognize
what is in a picture.

38
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,219
Is it a bee, or is it a three?

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,759
It's easy for humans (even little humans),

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,819
but it's impossible to just tell a bot 
in bot language how to do it,

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,679
because really we just know 
that's a bee and that's a three.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,099
We can say in words what makes them different, 
but bots don't understand words.

43
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,978
And it's the wiring in our brains 
that makes it happen anyway.

44
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,799
While an individual neuron may be understood, and clusters of neurons' general purpose vaguely grasped,

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,459
the whole is beyond.

46
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,019
Nonetheless, it works.

47
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,119
So to get a bot that can do this sorting,

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,419
you don't build it yourself.

49
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,199
You build a bot that builds bots,
and a bot that teaches bots.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,679
These bots' brains are simpler,
something a smart human programmer can make.

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,139
The builder bot builds bots, 
though it's not very good at it.

52
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,359
At first it connects the wires and modules in the bot brains almost at random.

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,479
This leads to some very...

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,439
"special" student bots sent to teacher bot to teach.

55
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,699
Of course, teacher bot can't
tell a bee from a three either;

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,219
if the human could build teacher bot to do that, 
well, then, problem solved.

57
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,779
Instead the human gives teacher bot a bunch of "bee" photos, and "three" photos,

58
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,959
and an answer key to which is what.

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,439
Teacher bot can't teach,

60
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,679
but teacher bot can TEST.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,848
The adorkable student bots stick out their tongues, try very hard,

62
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,779
but they are bad at what they do.

63
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,159
Very, VERY, bad.

64
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,039
And it's not their fault, really, 
they were built that way.

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,599
Grades in hand, the student bots take a march of shame back to builder bot.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,759
those that did best are put to one side,

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,419
the others recycled.

68
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,699
Builder bot still isn't good at building bots,

69
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,519
but now it takes those left
and makes copies with changes in new combinations.

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,479
Back to school they go.

71
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,939
Teacher bot teaches - er, tests again, and builder bot builds again.

72
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,919
And again, and again.

73
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,239
Now a builder that builds at random, 
and a teacher that doesn't teach, just tests,

74
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,019
and students who can't learn, they just are what they are, in theory shouldn't work,

75
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,759
but in practice, it does.

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,999
Partly because in every iteration, builder bot's slaughterhouse keeps the best and discards the rest,

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,839
and partly because teacher bot isn't overseeing an old-timey, one-room schoolhouse with a dozen students,

78
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,479
but an infinite warehouse with thousands of students.

79
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,739
The test isn't ten questions, but a million questions.

80
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,419
And how many times does the test, build, test loop repeat?

81
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,939
As many as necessary.

82
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,578
At first students that survive are just lucky,

83
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,459
but by combining enough lucky bots, and keeping only what works,

84
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,239
and randomly messing around with new copies of that

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,018
eventually a student bot emerges that isn't lucky,

86
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,659
that can perhaps barely tell bees from threes.

87
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,319
As this bot is copied and changed,
slowly the average test score rises,

88
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,659
and thus the grade needed to survive the next round gets higher and higher.

89
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,579
Keep this up and eventually from the infinite warehouse

90
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,099
(slaughterhouse)

91
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,759
a student bot will emerge, who can tell a bee from a three in a photo it's never seen before pretty well.

92
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,759
But how the student bot does this, neither the teacher bot nor the builder bot,

93
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,099
nor the human overseer, can understand.

94
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,499
Nor the student bot itself.

95
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,319
After keeping so many useful random changes,
the wiring in its head is incredibly complicated,

96
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,139
and while an individual line of code may be understood, and clusters of code's general purpose vaguely grasped,

97
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,919
the whole is beyond,

98
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,599
nonetheless, it works.

99
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,219
But this is frustrating, especially as the student bot is very good at exactly

100
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,999
only the kinds of questions it's been taught to.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,519
It's great with photos, but useless with videos or baffled if the photos are upside down,

102
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,119
or things that are obviously not bees, it's confident are.

103
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,519
Since teacher bot can't teach,

104
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,239
all the human overseer can do is give it more questions, to make the test even longer,

105
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,719
to include the kinds of questions the best bots get wrong.

106
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
This is important to understand.

107
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,539
It's a reason why companies are 
obsessed with collecting data.

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,859
More data equals longer tests equals better bots.

109
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,859
So when you get the "Are you human?" test on a website,

110
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,459
you are not only proving that you are human, 
(hopefully),

111
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,239
but you are also helping to build the test to make bots that can read, or count,

112
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,639
or tell lakes from mountains, or horses from humans.

113
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,079
Seeing lots of questions about driving lately?

114
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,879
Hmm...! What could that be building a test for?

115
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,379
Now figuring out what's in a photo, or on a sign, or filtering videos,

116
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,259
requires humans to make correct enough tests.

117
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,219
But there is another kind of test that makes itself.

118
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,519
Tests ON the humans.

119
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:11,179
For example, say entirely hypothetical NetMeTube wanted users to keep watching as long as possible?

120
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,539
Well, how long a user stays on the site is easy to measure.

121
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,619
So, teacher bot gives each student bot a bunch of NetMeTube users to oversee,

122
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,579
the student bots watch what their user watches, looks at their files,

123
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,819
and do their best to pick the videos
that keep the user on the site.

124
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,299
The longer the average, the higher their test score.

125
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,399
Build, test, repeat.

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,039
A million cycles later, there's a student bot who's pretty good at keeping the users watching,

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,639
at least compared to what a human could build.

128
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,199
But when people ask:
"How does the NetMeTube algorithm select videos?"

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,039
Once again, there isn't a great answer other than pointing to the bot,

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,139
and the user data it had access to,

131
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,419
and most vitally, how the human overseers 
direct teacher bot to score the test.

132
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,799
That's what the bot is trying to be good at to survive.

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,419
But what the bot is thinking, or how it thinks it,
is not really knowable.

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,999
All that's knowable is this student bot
gets to be the algorithm,

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,159
because it's point one percent better than the previous bot at the test the humans designed.

136
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,779
So everywhere on the internet, behind the scenes,
there are tests to increase user interaction,

137
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,239
or set prices just right to maximize revenue,

138
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,179
or pick the posts from all your friends you'll like the most, or articles people will share the most, or whatever.

139
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,839
If it's testable, it's teachable. Well, "teachable",

140
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,899
and a student bot will graduate from the warehouse 
to be the algorithm of its domain.

141
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,539
At least, for a little while.

142
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,439
We're used to the idea that the tools we use, even if we don't understand them, someone does,

143
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,979
but with our machines that learn we are increasingly in a position where we use tools,

144
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,459
or are used by tools,

145
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,719
that no one, not even their creators, understand.

146
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,219
We can only hope to guide them with the tests we make,

147
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,939
and we need to get comfortable with that,

148
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:58,239
as our algorithmic bot buddies are all around, 
and not going anywhere.

149
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,699
OK. The bots are watching.

150
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,319
You know what's coming.

151
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,919
This is where I need to ask you...

152
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,179
To like...

153
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,499
comment...

154
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,479
...and subscribe.

155
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,299
And bell me.

156
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,759
And share on the TweetBook.

157
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,779
The algorithm is watching.

158
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,199
It won't show people the video...

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,179
unless you do this.

160
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,259
Look what you've reduced me to, bots.

161
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,339
What do you want? Do you want watch time?

162
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,119
Is that what you want?

163
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,299
Fine.

164
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,259
(sigh...) Hey guys, did you know I also have podcasts you can listen to?

165
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:40,599
Maybe even just in the background while you're tidying up your all room for hours? Or whatever?

166
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,019
There's hours of audio entertainment for you, 
and watch time for the bots overseeing your actions.
