00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,685
[voice from the audience]
Hey!

2
00:00:01,686 --> 00:00:04,058
Hey.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,319
Where's the Q&A?

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,319
[Grey]
Oh… right.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,069
I lost track of time.

6
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,769
[confusedly]
What… year is it?

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,659
[retro video game sounds]

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,949
How are you and Lady Grey doing during lockdown?

9
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,459
We're fine.

10
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,885
Though we have become real little homebody bots.

11
00:00:17,886 --> 00:00:19,105
Even more so than normal

12
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:21,499
after we pulled up the drawbridge of Castle Grey

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,419
and settled into our cozy quarantine.

14
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,499
But this Q&A is getting ahead of itself.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,199
Hello Internet.

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,325
I hope you're doing alright.

17
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:30,452
Lockdown is a weird, different time for all of us.

18
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:32,745
And I know I promised this Q&A a while ago.

19
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:33,885
But the problem has been

20
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:36,425
because all my videos take a long time to make

21
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:37,679
(even Q&A videos)

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,812
I couldn't know into what state of the world

23
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:41,659
this final video would set sail.

24
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,125
A new dawn rising

25
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,832
or an apocalyptic night setting.

26
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,279
Impossible to know, so...

27
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,119
let me first give an answer to an unasked question.

28
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,589
How do you make big decisions under uncertainty?

29
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,112
For all decisions great and small, two things are true.

30
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:56,552
One: there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

31
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:59,552
And two: the fog of the future hides vital information.

32
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:01,279
This second point might sound so obvious

33
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,392
it's not worth discussing

34
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:04,211
but it's often forgotten when looking back

35
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,852
at decisions you've already made.

36
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:07,452
Giving a distorted perspective

37
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:10,245
that decisions were clearer than they really were.

38
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:12,572
When the reality is chiding yourself on a decision

39
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,119
you should have made is sort of pointless.

40
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,192
Unless you're trying to learn something new

41
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:18,379
for future decisions.

42
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,599
And for something that looks like

43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,172
a novel global pandemic out in the fog,

44
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,292
well, you're not going to have much information

45
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,419
at hand and much of what you will have

46
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,612
will be contradictory.

47
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:28,625
So what to do?

48
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:31,545
It's often advised to make a pro and con list when deciding.

49
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:33,179
Which, is better than nothing I guess.

50
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,105
But the format sort of implies each good thing

51
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:38,845
is about as good as each bad thing is bad.

52
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:40,585
Which is obviously not true.

53
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,419
Unfortunately, most good things have

54
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,459
an upper limit to how good they can be,

55
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,079
while bad things can be deeply bad.

56
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,425
And a potential pandemic brings that forth

57
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,039
with the specter of death.

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,552
The simultaneous murder of every Future-You

59
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:54,992
that would have been and could have been.

60
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:58,659
So for risk calculations, that's like a negative infinity?

61
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,172
Which really complicates things

62
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:02,499
because Death looms everywhere.

63
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,792
To live life is to constantly risk death

64
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:07,965
often with hilariously unbalanced calculations

65
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,992
of you getting some tiny reward

66
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,799
versus death getting to negative infinity you.

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,859
But there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

68
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,525
And with normal life, the trade-off is you try to ignore Death

69
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:20,485
in the banal decisions of your day to day,

70
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:21,612
(which lets you live life)

71
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:23,852
but the risk is you can become oblivious to

72
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,292
normal-seeming things that are really quite deadly.

73
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:29,472
And with a potential new Global Pandemic out in the fog

74
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:31,665
there are a lot of normal-seeming things

75
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,319
that might turn out to be really quiet deadly.

76
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,672
Unfortunately, the information you need about that

77
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:39,165
is also out there in the fog of the future.

78
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,432
Then, when infection vectors and transmission rates

79
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,819
and lethality and long-term complications are known,

80
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,332
the decision will have been easy

81
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,572
and you won't have under- or over-reacted.

82
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,912
But it's now and you don't know.

83
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:51,739
There are risks and there are rewards.

84
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,612
Everyone's calculation will be different

85
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,459
but here's how it went for us.

86
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,145
On my summer calendar were a lot of family visits

87
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:00,199
and interesting and unique opportunities

88
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,505
that were not replaceable.

89
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,212
Losing those, not good.

90
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:05,732
But, for my work, the aloner I am

91
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,039
the better it usually goes.

92
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,519
And personally, getting to wipe from my calendar

93
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,959
every social obligation without hesitation

94
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,739
or condemnation is not exactly a sacrifice.

95
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,692
Meanwhile, the Lady Grey is at unusually high risk

96
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:21,372
of exactly this sort of pandemic mortality.

97
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:23,729
Normal flu season is already not fun for us

98
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,039
and this sort of thing potentially looming

99
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,279
should make the calculation super clear for Castle Grey.

100
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,305
Lock down early.

101
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:31,339
Lock down long.

102
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,479
But even for us,

103
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,825
while we went into lockdown before our friends,

104
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,512
it was still later than we should have in retrospect.

105
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:38,312
Why?

106
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:40,799
Well, it's that damn fog of the future again.

107
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,259
Information at the very start was uncertain and contradictory.

108
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,585
Is this another flu?

109
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:47,799
Well, every flu season is a risk for us,

110
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,472
but we don't lockdown our lives

111
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:51,845
for four months a year every year

112
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,645
because that's too much of a trade off.

113
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,645
And with this, we felt a bit silly

114
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:57,745
being the first ones to pull up the drawbridge

115
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:59,059
and cancel all our plans.

116
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,905
Looking back now, it looks like reckless delay,

117
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:02,799
but of course,

118
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,839
that's biased by the information Current-Us now have.

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,259
And, at the time of writing,

120
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,779
we're facing the reverse problem.

121
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,559
Lots of people are out and about

122
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,239
as though life is back to normal.

123
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,445
And there's pressure to accept invitations and opportunities.

124
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:18,071
But we've learned from the past about feeling silly,

125
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:21,112
and for us, the risk-reward calculation makes it clear

126
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:24,492
that we still musn't be too hasty to lower the drawbridge.

127
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:26,125
That's the way for Castle Grey.

128
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:28,099
But an individual case can be easy

129
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,385
in a way the civilizational case is not.

130
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:33,992
So for that, let's discuss a theoretical global pandemic,

131
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:36,579
not this particular global pandemic

132
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,632
and how countries have to make decisions

133
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,132
under the fog of the future,

134
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,379
multiplied by millions of people.

135
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,352
So, is that a new global pandemic on the path?

136
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,899
It's a little hard to see.

137
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,899
Maybe it's another annual flu,

138
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,885
which kills just a quarter to half million people a year.

139
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:53,585
Or maybe it's another Spanish Flu

140
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,585
that kills 25 to 50 million.

141
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,545
Or maybe it's that once in a millennia Plague,

142
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:00,545
100 to 200 million.

143
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:02,399
Those are big risks.

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,399
So countries should lock down immediately, right?

145
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,659
Well, lockdowns are used because they're better at

146
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,739
slowing a plague than nothing,

147
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,019
But impermeable, they are not.

148
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,125
A good lockdown is best spent

149
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,605
to buy time to work out better treatments.

150
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:19,265
Which, if a country locks down early and hard enough,

151
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,232
and a treatment comes, that lockdown

152
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,145
might save millions from the next plague.

153
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:24,512
Assuming it is a plague.

154
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:27,412
But a hard lockdown will damage the economy.

155
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:29,012
Now you might think the economy

156
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:31,139
is the moneyed class checking their stonks

157
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,029
on their smart phones,

158
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,912
which it is,

159
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,352
but it's also a measure of everything

160
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:38,339
humans do that other humans value enough to pay for.

161
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,565
Which is a lot.

162
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,805
And includes the people

163
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:41,505
and companies

164
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:43,865
and governments working on better treatments,

165
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,019
and all the people

166
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,692
and companies

167
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:46,479
and governments

168
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,949
they depend on to be able to do that job.

169
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,499
National lockdown guarantees

170
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,912
large economic harm immediately,

171
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:56,779
and the downward curve of that harm accelerates.

172
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,372
So a country needs to weigh that known harm

173
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:02,299
against an upwardly accelerating curve of death,

174
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,639
or potential death.

175
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,372
Because, even in this video,

176
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:08,339
this way of talking about a potential pandemic

177
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,839
and drawing it out in the fog is too clear.

178
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,012
In reality, there's uncertain stories

179
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:15,679
in a faraway place about how a dozen people

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,892
might be sick from something maybe new.

181
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:20,912
Based on that, if you were in charge of a country

182
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,572
would you press the lockdown button

183
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:25,272
and cause guaranteed economic harm immediately?

184
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:26,752
Phawh, I dunno.

185
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,385
And of course there isn't a lockdown button.

186
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,852
That's again just a simplified way to just talk about

187
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:35,325
the huge number of policy dials at hand.

188
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:37,799
Which to turn up and which to turn down?

189
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,025
Some really matter.

190
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:39,912
Others don't.

191
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:41,772
And you don't know which is which

192
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:43,799
and underneath they're all interconnected

193
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,092
in non-linear ways.

194
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:45,985
Don't mess up!

195
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:47,985
Oh, and keep in mind, you will be judged,

196
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:50,525
not about how good the decision was at the time

197
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:51,985
(given the knowledge and trade-offs at the time)

198
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:53,812
but you will be judged in the future

199
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,125
by those looking backward

200
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,272
where there is no fog

201
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:57,999
and it was just so clear

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,425
and obvious what to do.

203
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:01,159
How could you possibly have not known

204
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,992
that this was the next plague [slash]

205
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,992
there was nothing to worry about all along?

206
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:07,285
Decisions under uncertainty are hard.

207
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,512
Okay, well that was fun.

208
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,185
Now on to some possibly tonally

209
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:11,865
inappropriately chipper questions.

210
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,319
"Has lockdown affected tumbleweed?"

211
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,009
I don't know,

212
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,112
but I don’t doubt they're taking

213
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:16,725
full advantage of the situation.

214
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:19,119
"How much do you think the world will change because of lockdown?"

215
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,812
Long term, not a lot?

216
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:22,905
It's easy when in a middle of a storm to think,

217
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:25,572
"Wow, this is going to change everything forever!"

218
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:26,752
But when the weather clears,

219
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:28,585
people just go back to their regular lives

220
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:29,279
and it's always,

221
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,845
"Dear Princess Celestia, I didn’t learn a thing."

222
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:33,325
I mean, that's often the best case.

223
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:34,485
What surprised me most

224
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:35,652
(but really shouldn't have)

225
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:38,085
is how little time it took for the pandemic

226
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:40,799
to go from this is a humanity scale problem

227
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,592
we must solve as a global humanity

228
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:45,512
to fracturing in the usual tiresome ways

229
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:47,452
with two groups each creating a totem,

230
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:49,105
they can yell about how the other side

231
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:51,105
is not just dumb but maliciously evil,

232
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,879
which is very helpful.

233
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,965
So I guess I actually expect the next time round

234
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:55,805
it will be worse

235
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:58,259
because everyone living through this pandemic now

236
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,052
will have picked their pandemic tribe

237
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:02,052
when before they didn't have one.

238
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:03,852
"What do you miss most about going outside?"

239
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:05,712
Taking a walk is really useful.

240
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:06,559
Stuck on a problem

241
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,465
or feeling anxious

242
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,345
or just need a break?

243
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,232
A little walk is the perfect solution

244
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,672
in a way a treadmill desk just can't replicate.

245
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:14,039
Even with a VR helmet.

246
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,845
I've tried.

247
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,325
"How do you feel about the state of VR?"

248
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:18,419
I bought my first set at the start of this lockdown

249
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,729
and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

250
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,729
VR done well is truly a new medium

251
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,572
to add to the list of film and books

252
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,925
and even traditional gaming.

253
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:29,039
It's just such a distinct experience.

254
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,512
And, especially when inside for weeks…

255
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:33,125
or months on end,

256
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,904
it's pretty good at tricking your brain

257
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,904
into thinking you've gone somewhere else.

258
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:39,652
The technology was over-hyped for two decades,

259
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,579
but this is the start of something real,

260
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,865
and Virtual Reality,

261
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,264
along with Augmented Reality,

262
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:47,025
is something I am pumped to see improve

263
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,712
over the next two decades.

264
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,932
"What's the fifth most important station on Spaceship You?"

265
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,932
The coffee station. Obviously.

266
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,645
"What about lockdown do you enjoy the most?"

267
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:56,779
It's an amazing feeling of freedom

268
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,779
to have a completely empty calendar.

269
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,779
It makes me think of the end the school year,

270
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,639
both as a student and a teacher.

271
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,979
So excited to leave the pseudo-prison

272
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,465
and all it's pointless busywork and obligations,

273
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:10,625
the structure of the human-imposed world fading away,

274
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:12,419
and leaving me alone to be alone.

275
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,365
But summer can only be a season long.

276
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:17,352
Eventually school and its tortuous tedium would return.

277
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:19,459
And so it goes with pandemic season.

278
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,605
The human-imposed world will return

279
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:23,605
but the interregnum is nice.

280
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,605
"How will lockdown affect education in the future?"

281
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,919
Well, I think primary and secondary school

282
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,652
at least will be pretty unaffected,

283
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,652
as we all jointly agree to pretend

284
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,652
their primary purpose is education,

285
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,092
not babysitification.

286
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,152
But I think this quarantine has made plain

287
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:40,512
some of the necessary lies of civilization around education,

288
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,299
particularly higher education.

289
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,712
But I leave what those are as an exercise for the viewer.

290
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:46,445
For now.

291
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:47,899
"Your Spaceship You video made it seem like

292
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,772
"you have it all sorted in these strange times.

293
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:51,285
"How sorted would you say you feel,

294
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,632
have you broken any of your rules?"

295
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,385
Well, I feel pretty sorted.

296
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,812
But I've been preparing for this my whole life,

297
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,659
so I'm in a fortunate situation.

298
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,912
However part of the reason

299
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:01,912
I made the Spaceship You video is because

300
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:03,439
I was thinking of my younger self.

301
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,825
When I first moved to London,

302
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,092
I had college loans,

303
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:07,072
no income,

304
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,385
no job prospects,

305
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:09,785
no social contacts,

306
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,172
no real plans,

307
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:13,519
just a room in shared accommodations.

308
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,865
Those first few months in London were hard

309
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,145
and had a global lockdown occurred then,

310
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:19,439
it would have been a…

311
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,865
dark situation.

312
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,239
So that video was a bit of a

313
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,392
message in a bottle for my younger self of,

314
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,392
"Hey, here's a bunch of stuff that will work for you.

315
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:29,585
Do this and save yourself years of figuring it out."

316
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:32,479
Because [spoiler], Spaceship You isn’t just a way

317
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,645
to think about lockdown.

318
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,025
It’s a way to think about your whole life.

319
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:38,245
Now, obviously my past self doesn't exist,

320
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,679
because the past doesn't exist,

321
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,085
so I can't send him a message,

322
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:44,345
but human personality matrices are limited in possibility,

323
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:47,559
so there are guaranteed to be lots of similar people

324
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,019
who would be similarly receptive.

325
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,072
As for the second part, the rules get broken.

326
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:54,372
But I don't call them rules in the video on purpose.

327
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:55,352
They're targets.

328
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,925
And the thing about a target is,

329
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,199
no matter how good you are,

330
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,199
no one hits the bullseye every time.

331
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,345
A target is about taking aim.

332
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:04,165
"Have you actually placed colorful tape

333
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,745
"around the house to mark your zones?"

334
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:09,445
No, but I did buy paint to make my office dark blue,

335
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:12,012
the color I most associate with important work.

336
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,872
It's the best way for me to make this part of my apartment

337
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,219
feel as different from the rest as possible.

338
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,439
"What's the best board game for family quarantine time?"

339
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,732
Oh, why Settlers of Catan, of course.

340
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,479
If you haven't tried it, you really should.

341
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,479
"If you were a virus, what would your goal be?"

342
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,119
To become irreplaceably symbiotic.

343
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,145
Hitching a ride on the future of humanity

344
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,325
is a better path to long term survival

345
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,439
than killing your host.

346
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,785
Viruses don't make plans, they just are.

347
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,839
But they do tend to become less fatal

348
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,732
over time for this very reason.

349
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,565
"Has the lockdown affected your schedule?"

350
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:42,919
Oh, yes has it!

351
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,772
I've make a calendaring discovery

352
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:45,365
so great

353
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:46,539
so monumental

354
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,219
I've pulled it out of this Q&A

355
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,865
because I want to propagandize it

356
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:51,865
as far and wide as possible.

357
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:54,605
"What home-based exercises have given you the most benefit?"

358
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:55,919
Without a doubt, weights.

359
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,509
It’s simple and has the best return on investment.

360
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,919
I don't like exercise.

361
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,932
I never have.

362
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:03,919
But a little set of weights have a lot going for them.

363
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,745
You can start way easy

364
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:07,745
and make spreadsheet-able progress quickly.

365
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:09,999
Get yourself some dumbbells and a pull-up bar

366
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,592
and you have maybe 65% the benefits

367
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,592
of a gym without having to leave home.

368
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,005
"Are handshakes gone for good?"

369
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:17,365
I hope so, but doubt it.

370
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:19,739
I can only say they're gone for good for me.

371
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,739
"Has lockdown impacted your projects?"

372
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,105
Oh yes.

373
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:25,745
So last year I started working on videos for a playlist

374
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,552
called Grey Goes Outside.

375
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:30,572
And I had a really big Summer of Grey planned

376
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:32,845
for some videos that were going to go on there

377
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:35,032
and trips related to current projects

378
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,592
and new places to visit and try to show people.

379
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:40,372
But, then... yeah.

380
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:41,859
Global pandemic.

381
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,012
My lockdown question for everyone has been:

382
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,359
"When do you think you will next get on an airplane?"

383
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,172
I’m curious for everyone’s answers

384
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:50,939
because I don't know what the answer is for myself.

385
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,239
How long will it be before I can visit an interesting place?

386
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,419
I just don't know.

387
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,579
The fog of the future,

388
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,972
at this moment in time,

389
00:12:57,973 --> 00:12:59,572
is just too dense.

390
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:01,979
But, I'll put that playlist up on the screen now

391
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,965
if you too are in lockdown and

392
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,525
need a bit of vicarious outside viewing.

393
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:07,985
See you next time, Internet.

394
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:09,109
Stay safe.

395
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,440
