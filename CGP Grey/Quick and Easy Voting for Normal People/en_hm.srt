00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,282
Hello Internet!

2
00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:03,482
You know I love me some voting videos.

3
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:05,002
These, however, are mostly about how

4
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:07,561
organizations can improve their elections.

5
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:09,717
But normal people need better voting too.

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,959
Say a group of you are trying to decide

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,251
what to have for dinner.

8
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:13,359
There are three options:

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,914
Steak Shack - All meat all the time

10
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,218
Veggie Villa - Hope you like lettuce

11
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,877
and Burger Barn - Every burger ever.

12
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:19,905
(Including the ones made from not-meat?)

13
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,383
Just asking people to pick their favorites

14
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:24,075
as normal results in three starved carnivores.

15
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:25,354
Now you could use one of these

16
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:27,130
better methods I've talked about before.

17
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:28,258
But seriously, who wants to break out

18
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:29,743
the pens and paper and nerd

19
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:31,315
to crank the algorithm for a question

20
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:33,506
that should be answered in under 30 seconds?

21
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,095
No one. So here the fastest way to vote

22
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:36,298
in a group with none of that stuff required.

23
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,330
Don't blink or you'll miss it.

24
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:38,664
Hands up if you're good with Steak Shack,

25
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:39,935
Hands up if you're good with Burger Barn,

26
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,444
Hands up if you're good with Veggie Villa.

27
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:42,017
Boom

28
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:42,598
Election over.

29
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,886
Burger Barn domination.

30
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:45,556
This time, everybody gets to live.

31
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:47,552
The difference? Letting people vote

32
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:48,743
more than once.

33
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:49,583
If you're in a group and picking

34
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:50,732
from several options quickly,

35
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:51,963
then this is the way to go.

36
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,853
It's world-changingly great at stopping

37
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,695
arguments like, for example,

38
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:56,709
in a classroom.

39
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,391
Hey kids! We're gonna watch a movie today!

40
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,995
Because, I just can't, anymore...

41
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:01,833
So let's go:

42
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,003
Hands up for Terminator 2

43
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,116
Hands up for Spirited Away.

44
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:05,092
Hands up for WALL-E.

45
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:05,943
Done. WALL-E it is.

46
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:07,909
Lazy Bonus! If you're in charge of the vote,

47
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,975
no need to keep an eye out

48
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:10,129
for those aspiring dictators who

49
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,256
subvert democracy by voting more than once.

50
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:13,574
Voting more than once

51
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:14,603
is the whole point.

52
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:15,429
So, next time you're in a group

53
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,111
trying to decide,

54
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:17,542
don't just ask for the favorite,

55
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,323
ask for all the OKs.

56
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:20,447
Best way to decide quickly,

57
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:23,596
no pen or paper or nerd required.
