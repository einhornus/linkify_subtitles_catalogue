00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,189
## This Video Will Hurt

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,609
Please, put on your headphones -- I promise
that there won't be any loud sounds, but this

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,528
video is going to hurt.

4
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,149
There's a study about hypersounds and how
they cause headaches: these sounds are too

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,138
high-pitched to hear -- like the one added
to this video, playing right now -- but cause

6
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:16,709
headaches they still do.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,949
The hypersound in your headphones is pressing
on your inner ear, stressing the nerves leading

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,879
to your brain where, if the headache hasn't
started already, it soon will as exposure

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,699
causes headaches after only ten seconds.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,699
Oh my.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,699
Can you feel it?

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,398
That pressure on your ears spreading to your
now throbbing brain?

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,398
Because...

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,119
...you shouldn't: the study is made up and
there's no hypersound in the audio, but still

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,639
some of you will have began to feel a headache.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,639
Why?

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,639
The nocebo effect.

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,599
A nocebo is a harmless thing -- like a video
with nonexistent hypersounds -- that causes

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,849
harm -- like a headache -- because you *believe*
it's harmful.

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,019
That sounds like Voodoo, but there's science
behind the nocebo effect, which is more than

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,318
an irritating parlor trick, it causes real
problems like in medicine.

22
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:02,110
When testing a new drug doctors get a group
of sick people give half of them the new drug

23
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:06,779
and give the other have a fake pill that does
nothing -- but which they're told is real.

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,599
This is how science finds the stuff that works
amongst the junk that doesn't.

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,499
But new drugs have side effects and sometimes
patients drop out of the experiment because

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,499
of them.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,609
No surprise there.

28
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,619
But some people on the fake *also* drop out
from the side effects.

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,179
Side effects they've gotten from a drug they
*aren't* taking.

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,919
But because they *think* they're on the real
thing, they've also *thought* themselves into

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,249
the side effects.

32
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,879
Now maybe this is just a case of misattribution:
people get headaches and, if they're joined

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,740
a drug trial that lists headaches in the side
effects, it's natural to blame the new drug

34
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:38,319
-- and that certainly happens to some extent.

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,389
But the nocebo effects is more than just misattribution,
it causes real, additional harm that scientists

36
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,109
can measure in cruel, cruel experiments -- and
this is one of the reasons there not an over

37
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,959
abundance of research on nocoboes: approach
your friendly neighborhood ethics board with

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,529
an experiment designed to hurt people and
they'll frown on that.

39
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,709
But sometimes nocebo experiments do get approved
to the benefit of science and humanity, if

40
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,879
not the participants.

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,319
For example, under the right conditions some
people who expect a harmless injection will

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,478
give them a rash will get a rash, but for
people who expect nothing to happen, nothing

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,379
is exactly what happens.

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,469
And fake pills can be additive: take test
subjects off pills they believe are addictive

45
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,979
and some will experience nocebic withdrawal
symptoms -- like pain and fatigue -- from

46
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,449
the pills that they could never have been
addicted to in the first place.

47
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,059
Another experiment gave people harmless injections,
told half of them to just sit there and told

48
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,309
the other half that their pain would increase
for the next thirty minutes -- which it did.

49
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,199
But in this situation there is a drug that
can block the nocebo effect and those who

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,049
were told the injection would hurt, but were
also secretly given the nocebo-blocking drug

51
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,869
did *not* report an increase in pain -- showing
that the nocebo effect is a real, physical

52
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,869
process.

53
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,049
In all these nocebo experiments it's the belief
in harm that matters.

54
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,629
If someone dressed as a voodoo witch doctor
popped up and hexed you with a curse of great

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,059
pain -- no effect.

56
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,068
But, in a room with a real doctor and his
clipboard and a big science machine and a

57
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,479
needle in your arm, you'll take his words
rather more seriously.

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,429
Which is why doctors say: "This won't hurt
a bit" rather than "Oh this?

59
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,529
It's going to hurt.

60
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,068
Like *a lot*." -- which, by the way, was a
real experiment done on women undergoing labor

61
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,319
during spinal injections.

62
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,579
Guess how that turned out?

63
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,239
But nocebos don't end here.

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,229
While illnesses like the flu, spread from
contact with disgusting, germ-infected humans

65
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,999
and the things they touch with their, disgusting
germy hands -- a nocebo spreads from mind

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,919
to mind, no contact required.

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,818
A notable example happened in a Tennessee
high school.

68
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,619
One teacher reported a strange smell in her
classroom and developed symptoms of headache

69
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,599
nausea, and difficulty breathing.

70
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,879
These symptoms spread to some of her students
and from them to others in the school.

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,068
Almost two hundred people ended up at the
local hospital but all medical tests came

72
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,818
back with nothing, nor was anything harmful
found at the school.

73
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:52,598
This was a nocebo -- the belief that the air
was making them sick -- spread mind to mind.

74
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,309
Everyone who got sick heard about the symptoms
from someone else.

75
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,599
When this happens, it's called mass psychogenic
illness.

76
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,749
The treatment in these cases is to separate
those with symptoms from the rest and reassure

77
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,229
the ill that yes, their symptoms are real,
but no they haven't been exposed to anything

78
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,859
toxic, and yes people are getting better quickly:

79
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,679
The last is one of the indicators that separates
a real poison gas leak or biological weapon

80
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,469
from mass psychogenic illness.

81
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,759
But the final factor, number of cases increasing
with greater media coverage, can lead to this

82
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,198
kind of thing spreading far and wide.

83
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,629
Take, electrosensitives: people who get nausea
(among other things) from exposure to parts

84
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,039
of the electromagnetic spectrum, notably WiFi
the density of which is increasing over time,

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,799
forcing particularly bad sufferers to retreat
to places like the creepy-sounding radio science

86
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,379
zone in, where else, West Virginia.

87
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,749
But put electrosensitives in a room with a
WiFi router and they can't actually tell via

88
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,219
their symptoms if it's on or off.

89
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,179
Instead their symptoms track with being told
if it's on or off.

90
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,689
And if you make a group of people without
electrosensitivity watch a news report on

91
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,099
how Wifi makes you ill while another group
watches something uninformative and afterward

92
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,630
expose both groups to a fake Wifi signal only
some of those who watched the news report

93
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:05,699
feel sick.

94
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,169
There's a similar phenomenon called 'wind
farm disease' with similar side effects, which

95
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,429
turns up where it's been talked about on the
local news, but not in other places in the

96
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,519
same country with the same wind farms where
it isn't.

97
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,289
All this makes it too easy to mock people
for thinking they're getting sick from WiFi

98
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,379
or Wind farms or *Wind farms with WiFi* -- but
it's important to realize they're not crazy,

99
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,019
the side effects are real, they're just wrong
about the source: all evidence points to the

100
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,349
belief in electrosensitivy as the cause of
electrosensitivity.

101
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,099
Which means the news reports talking about
these illnesses are spreading a kind of mind

102
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,099
virus.

103
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,079
And while these are exotic examples, there
is also evidence that some allergies and asthma

104
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,029
cases are nocebic and thus able to be spread
in the same way.

105
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,829
To be clear: if someone's having an asthma
attack, that's not the time to tell them you

106
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,309
know they're being a drama llama because you
watched an Internet video about the nocebo

107
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,309
effect.

108
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,789
*They're really having an asthma attack* and
they *really* need something to make it stop

109
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,259
and that's *really* not you showing off your
knowledge.

110
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,289
Harmful things aren't harmful just because
we believe they are -- the right dose of arsenic

111
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,879
will kill you as surely as an anvil to the
head, no matter your insistence otherwise.

112
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,448
But the nocebo effect does show that our beliefs
about otherwise harmless things can make them

113
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,448
harmful.

114
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,179
Which means that our voodoo doctor's hex from
before really could work, but only if you

115
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,689
were foolish enough to believe him.
