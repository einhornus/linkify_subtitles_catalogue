1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,639
This is my dad's Tesla and
I'm going to take it driving on...
 

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,759
The Deadliest Road in America.
But!
 

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,519
I'm not going to be driving
because I've just installed the
 

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,599
full self-driving, pre-release BETA software.
It's only allowed right now  

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,159
on a tiny number of cars 
for testing in urban environments so, 
 

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,119
of course I wanted to try it out on a
famously dangerous mountain road
 

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,399
to see what it can really do. 
Will I survive? 
 

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,239
Will I crash my dad's car and be in BIG trouble?
Right now I don't know but, 
 

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:57,599
either way, 
[sunglasses snap] it's road trip time.
 

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,879
You deserve a real name, Winter.
Welcome to the world!
 

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,279
So, where are we?
In the Great Smoky Mountains, 
 

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,599
on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee
 

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,479
where lies a mountain pass of some of the most
twisty and dangerous driving in the country. 
 

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,959
Just hours after we arrived, 
this happened. 
 

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,519
Parts from accidents like these 
are salvaged to build the
 

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,559
Tree of Shame at the entrance 
to serve as warning to others
 

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,959
of what can go wrong. 
But here's the thing, 
 

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,439
driving hundreds of curves faster than you should
on a mountains edge it's a lot of fun. 
 

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:41,519
Name it the Tail of the Dragon 
and the drivers will come. 
 

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:54,239
I don't have any idea what this is, 
...but it's adorable. 
 

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,079
I did not understand just how 
dangerous this was until now. 
 

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,719
The nearest hospital is an hour away so,
on busy days like this an ambulance waits for the
 

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,519
inevitable at the exit to save time. 
But ambulances are not immune from accidents. 
 

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,679
Off hours is when drivers push the limits when,
they hope, no one is around. 
 

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,799
Going over the speed limit to break records. 
Crossing yellow lines
 

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,559
and rounding blind turns with sheer drops. 
Trucks are banned from the road  

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,839
for being to great a risk, 
but signs don't stop everyone. 
 

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,399
[truck horn blast] [Driver] Got a little lost!
[Grey] The police were waiting  

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,439
for him down the road. 
The Dragon has killed multiple people
 

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,599
along every one of its eleven miles. 
It's a challenge for even the best human  

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,199
drivers but, 
I'm putting my  

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,159
life in the hands of a non-human driver. 
Ugh! I'm having some serious doubts about this. 
 

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,839
On the drive up I had to disengaged
the BETA auto-pilot several times 
 

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,599
and last night while
doom-scrolling Dragon accident videos, 
 

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,079
I found the last guy who tried
the old Tesla Auto-Pilot on this road,
 

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,119
and he had to disengage minutes in, 
because it was, "waaay too dangerous."
 

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,199
I'm not confident she's going to make this run
without me having to disengage  

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,079
and take over but, 
I guess that's the whole point right?
 

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,439
BETA testing the robot. 
With. My life. 
 

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,919
Okay, here we go!
I'm going to  

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,359
put her in full self-driving BETA mode
and I'm going to have my hands on the wheel but
 

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
let the wheel slide through 
them so that you can see that 
 

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,479
it's really the Tesla doing it herself. 
Alright, motorcycle, high-crash area and....
 

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,119
this is the official start. 
Here we go. 
 

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,159
Oh, boy!
 

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,599
Also, I'm not doing any of the speed
adjusting around these turns, 
 

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:43,279
so she's deciding entirely how 
slow to take the corners. 
 

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,519
So making left-hand turns,
the Tesla is just too close to the line. 
 

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,279
I wish there was a way I could tell her, 
"Stay as close to the white line as possible."
 

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,759
Which she's doing now, just 
fine, on the right-hand turn,
 

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,759
but on the left-hand turns, 
ahh, it, it's a little dicer. 
 

52
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,599
The one thing is very helpful though is, 
 

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,279
I can really look much further 
down the road then I could
 

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
if I had to also be keeping my 
eyes fully on the turn ahead, 
 

55
00:04:06,960 --> 00:05:11,279
so I am very alert for traffic 
coming the other way. 
 

56
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,359
Oh my god, haha, oh my god, it's over!
 

57
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,159
She did the whole road all by herself. 
Ahhh. Ha ha ha. Ah-mazing. 
 

58
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,959
Ooph. Wooh! She made it!
Allll the way by herself.
 

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,639
Zero disengagements the entire time. 
Ahh, I'm so pumped.
 

60
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:48,959
Alright. Now it's time to 
turn around and go back. 
 

61
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,759
That's hilarious. She's 
stopping for the photographer. 
 

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,159
Winter, I didn't know you 
were a bit of a vain girl. 
 

63
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,719
[photo shutter click click click click....click]
Okay, this is it. This is the start,
 

64
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,039
the official start of the Dragon's Tail.
Auto-pilot has brought us to our destination. 
 

65
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,559
Gonna pop into the General Store. 
Well I've got to get one for Winter.
 

66
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,319
She totally deserves it. 
I've got something for you. 
 

67
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,999
She did the whole route all by herself. 
 

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,279
It's still a very beta BETA
but this self-driving test  

69
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:33,840
made it up and down the Dragon
with zero human intervention.
