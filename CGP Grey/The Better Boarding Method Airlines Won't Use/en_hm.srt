00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,599
[Grey sighs]

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,959
What’s the fastest way to board an airplane?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,739
I mean, you can’t just throw open the gates like funneling cattle into a chute.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,539
That’s not for us.  We’re primates, after all!

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,459
So let’s put our monkey brains to work to tackle this queue which is what boarding groups do:

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,299
Prioritize, plainly packing primates precisely. (Primarily)

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,779
Ok, we have a suggestion: pour people into the plane back to front.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,579
This is an intuitive solution to fill a cylinder.

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,199
But there's almost a law of the universe that solutions which are…

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,039
…the first thing you'd think of and look sensible and are easy to implement are often…

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,359
… terrible, ineffective solutions, once implemented will drag on civilization forever.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,359
:: Cough, voting systems, cough ::

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,399
So it should come as no surprise that this method is…

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,639
… not good and also what most airlines use to board their planes.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,919
Let's watch it in action:

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,399
The first boarding group walks to the back of the plane.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,238
Everything is smooth right until the first to go reaches their row and starts to stow.

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,879
So slow.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,759
And for passenger two, while their seat is in view, there's nothing to do.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,439
The aisle's one queue, where all can naught but stew, stuck like glue until this guy's through.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,759
:: Phew ::

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,519
It's bags.  Bags cause most of the delay boarding a flight.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,679
Like with this: a full-stop stow.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,679
When it happens, everyone boarding the plane within and without must wait until one person finishes stowing their bag.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,119
Can you feel it?  The aggregate lost seconds of human life piling up like a bounty for a delighted reaper?

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,839
Of course you can.  You can feel it with every bag.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,839
:: Uhhh :: What was I saying?

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,639
Right, back-to-front boarding groups have a lot of full-stop stows, and very few of what you want:

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,559
… pullaways and parallels and parallels and pullaways.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,559
Pullaways turn one queue into two.

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,839
And parallels decrease total bag stow time and are super satisfying.

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,279
The rare triple partner parallel invoking a double high-five at the sheer pleasure of its efficiency.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,639
But loading back to front lets few of these happen.

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,559
Now say you weren't just… not good at designing boarding groups,…

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,639
… but you were malicious and wanted to maximize the amount of human life wasted upon a flight.

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,639
What would you do?

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,959
Not back-to-front but front to back -- the smaller the boarding group the better.

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,599
This makes almost every tedious shuffle forward result in a full stop stow,…

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,239
…because most of the line waits by rows already full or outside the plane.  Look familiar?

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,679
This is where we acknowledge the class structure of airplanes.

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,839
Real planes look like this and first class boards first, front to back, …

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,479
… before the pro-conomy file in back-to-front.

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,479
So, excluding pre-boarding, all airlines start with a little of the slowest boarding method you could intentionally design.

45
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,119
Now, obviously, this video will soon reveal faster boarding procedures.

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,479
And you will wonder, “why don't airlines use the faster methods?”

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,759
One possible answer is economic incentives.

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,359
First class pays for perks -- sometimes breathtaking perks for breathtaking amounts.

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,399
And boarding first is one of them.

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,719
Also, airlines give everyone loyalty points that move you up the class structure the more you fly with that airline.

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,519
Which gives airlines another good reason to group people.

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:26,039
And probably helps explain why they switched away from the older faster method you won’t believe they used to use:

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,119
[Grey on microphone]: "Hey, everyone.  Plane’s here.  Go ahead."

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,599
Doing nothing and having people board the flight in whatever order they show up…

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,599
… to get their assigned seat, is faster than organizing tidy boarding groups.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,599
This is because random people are spread, well, randomly, …

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,999
… increasing the chances of pullaways and parallels, unlike the more orderly methods airlines have switched to.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,599
Man, it's always frustrating to know that to literally have done nothing …

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,959
… would be faster than the something that is done.

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,919
But surely there's a better boarding group order to be found if we can just subtract malice and add thinking to this problem.

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,879
Ahh!  Three groups: window, middle, aisle.  In that order.

62
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,399
This is really the same as doing random thrice, one for each column of the craft ...

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,399
… but the reason it's a smidge faster is because it eliminates the other source of boarding delay:

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,439
Seat shuffles.

65
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,119
When people board randomly, seat shuffling is going to happen a bunch.

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,398
And when people spill into the aisle, it slows the queue.

67
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,919
Ordering everyone by window, middle, aisle ensures a seat shuffle will never happen.

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,439
This seems like it should be a big improvement.

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,759
But when you simulate boarding an aircraft with a ton of real math …

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,239
(rather than just animating it in a dramatically simplified fashion)

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,839
… or do actual experiments, the seat shuffle just isn't a big deal compared to bag stowage.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,279
People wrangling their one bag that won't possible fit, …

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,319
… or trying to get onboard with three bags because they don't think the rules should apply to them, …

74
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,999
… who then also fiddle around getting their laptops out after stowing them.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,719
Those kinds of delays count for much more.

76
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,399
So, Window-Middle-Aisle is maybe a smidge faster than random, which is good …

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,239
… and some airlines use this method, which gets their planes turned around faster than back-to-front …

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,759
… while still giving them boarding groups to play games with.

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,279
The vast majority of airlines use either back to front or window-middle-aisle.

80
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,839
So keep an eye out next time you’re boarding a flight for which is happening to you.

81
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,279
But can we go farther?

82
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,319
Leaving the real world: with its class systems and people, and untidiness and smells, …

83
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,919
… ascending to the platonic plain of physics, …

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,719
… where cows are spheres and people cellular automaton who will execute instructions perfectly.

85
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,159
Here, in the Celestia, what is the theoretically fastest way to board a plane?

86
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,879
On this level, here is what’s possible:

87
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:53,039
[The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a: VIII. Waltz of the Flowers]

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,319
To achieve this ballet, there are no boarding groups, but everyone stands in an exact order.

89
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,679
Back-to-front in alternating rows, on alternating sides, windows in.

90
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,479
This maximizes pullaways and parallels.

91
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,959
Pristinely packing people in a pinch.

92
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,799
Witnessing such glory is too much for mortal minds to bear for long…

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,399
… so we are forced to descend back down into the meat world.

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,879
The cacophony!  The smell!

95
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,519
Where we must stuff monkeys into a tube.

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,159
Monkeys with families, where separating their young invites chaos and cleanup.

97
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,119
Where economic incentives divide and profit.

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:38,239
And where, even at their best, the human inability to follow instructions is breathtaking.

99
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,999
Here, people, upon seeing 'boarding group 123', would flip the hell out.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,479
Let alone the impossibility of trying to get them to stand in line in order.

101
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,479
And where even if faster, like watching seconds of a clock, people would complain it was slower.

102
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,759
[Grey sighs]

103
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,839
Such gifts we were not meant to have.

104
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,419
But is there a way we can modify this perfection to improve our lot on this plane?

105
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:03,919
Yes.

106
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,479
Instead of exact order, boarding group the first would be all one side of the plane in every other row.

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,799
Boarding group the second, the other side, then back, and back again.

108
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,239
One, two, three, four.  We can't ask people for more.

109
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,239
This shadow of the perfect method has a chance of working in the real world with benefits like:

110
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,199
letting humans with families and friends board together, …

111
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,999
giving airlines boarding groups they can still play with, …

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,959
and still being faster than the current methods.

113
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,319
Reaching for perfection, we will always come up short.

114
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,920
But perhaps we can manage to get closer in the process.
