1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,119
When it comes to neighbors, most countries
have several options: like North to Canada

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,439
or South to Mexico.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,279
But there are countries that don't have this
freedom of choice, not because they're islands

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,678
but because they're trapped in another country.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,069
For example: tiny Vatican City, which fits
inside of not just Italy, but also just Rome.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,409
How Vatican City got surrounded is complicated,
but not unique for there is also the Republic

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,119
of San Marino, home to 30,000 citizens which
Italy also completely surrounds.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,499
Italy, apparently, is a country that likes
countries in its country.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,409
But trapping nations is not just Italy's thing
for there's also Lesotho, in South Africa

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,889
which is both the largest encircled country
at 70 times Vatican City's size and the most

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,439
populated with over 2,000,000 citizens.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,959
The thing that makes these three countries'
borders bizarre is that any path in or out

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,009
must go through the one and only neighbor
they have.

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,089
But now take a look at The Gambia, which excluding
that tiny ocean border, is as surrounded as

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,509
any nation can get.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,239
If we amend the previous rule to every land
route, now we've made a category of single-neighbored

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,239
nations.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,319
Which includes all four of these and countries
like Portugal, where the only way in or out

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,509
is through Spain.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,739
Who else is on this list?

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,649
Well, there's Monaco which must go through
France, Qatar through Saudi Arabia Denmark

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,548
through Germany, South Korea through North
Korea (though South Korea might as well be

23
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,118
an island nation for most practical travel
purposes)

24
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,759
East Timor and Papua New Guinea both through
Indonesia, Brunei through Malaysia

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,819
And there are two sets of twins: there is
The Dominican Republic whose only neighbor

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,769
is Haiti and Haiti, whose only neighbor is
The Dominican Republic.

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,789
And the second set is: Ireland through the
United Kingdom and the United Kingdom through

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,789
Ireland.

29
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,789
A side note here:

30
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,119
While there are tons of 'British' places around
the world, some of which border other nations

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,339
-- these are not part of the United Kingdom.

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,419
It's complicated.

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,339
Though if you wanted to, you could argue that
the United Kingdom technically dug a land

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,559
border under the channel to the continent,
presumably to be closer to France, her best

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,559
friend ever.

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,789
Finally, there's one more country in this
category: Canada: the largest single-neighbored,

37
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,620
nation in the world.
