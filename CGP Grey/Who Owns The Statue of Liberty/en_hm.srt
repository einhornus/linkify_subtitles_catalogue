1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,099
Who owns the Statue of Liberty?  New York or New Jersey?

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,979
It should be straight forward, but the island upon which the statue stands, Liberty Island…

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,459
…  has been part of a long fight between the states over their river border…

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,019
… and the islands between them, …

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,539
… with rounds in the 90s, the 80s, the 30s (the 1830s) and possibly more beyond 2000.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,219
But to understand we must first go back to the 1600s.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,159
New Netherland was minding her own business, when England using bigger-navy diplomacy made the Dutch colony hers.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,999
Here the trouble begins, for England split New Netherland in twain, but not cleanly.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,359
The mess wasn't entirely England's fault.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,199
She was far away and maps in the 1600s, while they weren't bad, they weren't good either.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,899
Thus, the charter splitting New Netherlands reads [*clears throat*]: …

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,159
"THIS INDENTURE made the four and twentieth day of June, in the sixteenth year of... [*mumbles*] ...

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,679
...Whereas... by Letters under Patents of the Great Seal of England, bearing date on or about the twelfth day of...

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,999
... [duhduhduhduhduh... OK, OK], did... give and grant...

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,619
… all that tract of land... belonging to the westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island…

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,259
… and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river...

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,119
… which said tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name... of...

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,199
… New Caeserea? Or New Jersey.”

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,699
You pick.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,679
Ugh, hoo-boy is this not an easy read.  Paragraph breaks, England, you should try them.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,019
This charter has uncertainty about the names of everything, wrong latitude and longitude numbers, and incomplete descriptions of the rivers.

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,799
It's all a vague mess.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,439
For example, is this part of the Hudson river, or not? The charter doesn’t say.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,359
And "bounded on the east" but where?

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,759
And there's another part about "several other islands" but, which islands exactly?

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,079
Like, say Ellis Island and Liberty Island?

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,959
England said, whatever, your problem now and left the young colonies to three hundred years of squabbling.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,819
New Jersey said the Hudson flowed out to sea, and her border ran down the middle of the river,…

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,419
… like it does in every other colonial charter, and thus the islands Staten, Ellis, and Liberty were hers.

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,739
But New York, the Empire State, disagreed.

31
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,339
The Hudson river? Flows roundward then onward.

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,859
These islands?  New York.

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,639
And also the river, the whole river, and the piers you've built into the river.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,679
All New York. All belong to us.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,919
New Jersey didn't agree, but when borders are vague, bigger stick diplomacy rules.

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,399
And with the wealthy and powerful city of New Amster-- er... New York at the heart of the conflict, …

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,519
… New York got what New York wanted.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,819
When New Caeser-- er... New Jersey asked: "Why don't we split the river?"

39
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,939
New York asked: "Why don't you make me?"

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,719
And also: "Where are my taxes from those piers?"

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,899
And also: “This island is a small pox quarantine now."

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,199
And also: "Stop hitting yourself."

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,699
By 1832, New Jersey had enough and called in the teacher, er... Supreme Court.

44
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,679
New York didn't show up -- saying the court had no authority to settle a disagreement between the states.

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,179
Which sounds crazy now but was kind of an unsettled question at the time.

46
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,199
Because America was having power struggles with unruly states then…

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,239
… and New York blowing off the Supreme Court wasn't helping.

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,599
Worse: if the Supreme Court ruled New York must share her borders (which seemed likely) …

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,139
… New York would comply... whoops, NO, New York was going to tell the court to get bent.

50
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,959
America, trying to grow up to be a powerful federal goverment, did not want this.

51
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,899
So the Supreme Court decided to not take the case right now, maybe later …

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:30,119
… and then America used some political leverage to get New York to agree to settle the matter privately with New Jersey.

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,339
So the two states haggled:

54
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,579
New Jersey gave up her claims to Staten Island and in return…

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,059
… New York agreed New Jersey's northern border extended into the river and down the middle…

56
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,159
… past Ellis Island, past Liberty Island...

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,199
... squeezing around Staten Island before going back out to sea.

58
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,819
Ah hah!  So the Statue of Liberty is in New Jersey!

59
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,959
No, New Jersey also gave up Ellis Island and Liberty Island too.

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,019
Which seems like giving up a lot, but look, river access in the age of steam boats was a big deal.

61
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,419
And sacrificing a couple islands to get her piers back was worth it.

62
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,239
And America was happy because a power struggle between her and the states was averted.

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,139
And everything was going to be smooth sailing…

64
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,339
Ohhhhhh.......

65
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,659
Uh, anyway, both islands are New York enclaves inside New Jersey's border.

66
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,099
Which does make answering the question "Where is the Statue of Liberty?" …

67
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,419
… with "In New Jersey" technically correct in the most pointless kind of way.

68
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,059
Now in the midst of all this, America noticed Liberty Island's rather strategic position…

69
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:36,459
… and she took it for herself as federal land and built a pretty star fortress upon it that could shoot in every direction.

70
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,239
Look familiar?

71
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,579
Later when France sent America the Statue of Liberty as a symbol of their eternal friendship …

72
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,239
(A bond forged side-by-side in the heat of the young rebel's battle for freedom from the Empire …

73
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,979
… a bond America would surely "hashtag" never forget.)

74
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:59,799
… America said: "I will put it right here where it will be the first thing everyone coming to the United States will see!  BFFs, France!  BFFs, forever."

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,139
So the statue was put atop an old Federal Fort on Federal Land and, pow, made a National Monument.

76
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,219
So America owns the statue?

77
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,739
This opens a book titled “What is Federal Land, like what does it mean? for real though?”.

78
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,459
Which will be firmly closed as a story for another time otherwise we will never finish this.

79
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,199
It's still only the 60s and we have yet to talk about the squabble over the land below the water... yesreally.

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,599
So back to Ellis Island for a moment.

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,219
Which, a hundred and fifty years after borders were supposedly settled, New Jersey claimed as hers again, partly.

82
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,819
See: in the 1800s the island was yay big, but by the 1990s, it was *yay* big.

83
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,619
And because the rivalries of youth never really end, New Jersey again brought in the Supreme Court.

84
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,679
This time New York showed up promptly.

85
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,779
The added land, New Jersey said, was hers.

86
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,099
New York disagreed saying the embiggened island was still her island.

87
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,059
Now, how did Ellis island get bigger?

88
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,899
Well New York claimed while digging up the subways she dumped the dirt, uh, here.

89
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,059
In New Jersey's half of the river.

90
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,499
But her dirt = her new land, which is an interesting territorial acquisition strategy.

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,799
But neither New York nor New Jersey could find any paperwork for the court to prove where the land came from.

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,979
So how Ellis Island grew three sizes is just lost to history.

93
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,279
But whatever. The court ruled everything above the water was New York …

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,499
… and everything below the water was New Jersey.

95
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,799
But if below became above, New New Jersey it would be.

96
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,719
And thus this island belongs to New Jersey with just this little original part being New York.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,159
Which is a sublime and ridiculous border that opens the door to one squabble remaining.

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,499
Liberty Island was originally yay but now it's *yay*.

99
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,339
Which, means, this part should be New Jersey, not New York.

100
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,699
Though it hasn't been fought over yet, (possibly because neither state has noticed)…

101
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,059
… and while it would still leave Lady Liberty on the New York side.…

102
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,639
… you know what would be on the New Jersey side?  The Gift Shop.

103
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,419
And the only thing more important than who owns the monument…

104
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,579
… is who owns the gift shop for the monument.  We will see.

105
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,539
But as it is, within the waters of New Jersey, there's an island of New York …

106
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,559
… that's federal land...atop which the national monument of the Statue of Liberty stands.

107
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:20,119
[music]

108
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,399
Oh, there's also Shooter's island.  The State border runs... right through it.

109
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,779
I’m not sure anyone noticed.

110
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,240
Uhh... it's a bird sanctuary run by New York, so whatever.
