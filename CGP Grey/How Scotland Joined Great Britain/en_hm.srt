1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,989
Back in the 1690s there were only two countries
on the island of Great Britain: The Kingdom

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,079
of Scotland and the Kingdom of England.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,468
England and the other great european powers
were doing rather well for themselves by expanding

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,189
their empires through the cunning use of flags.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,199
Scotland had no empire but wanted to join
in the game, and thus needed to establish

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,409
a colony of her very own.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,899
But where to build it?

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,899
"Panama!" declared Scotland.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,369
She imagined the colony's strategic location
would make trade with the far east safer and

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,899
faster by eliminating the long journey around
the hazardous Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,119
where both wind and wave delight in smashing
ships against rock and ice.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,539
"Who will lend me money to make this great
idea a reality?" asked Scotland.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,539
No one, was the answer.

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,108
Instead of helping, the european empires started
trade wars with Scotland to limit the power

15
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,288
of their future rival.

16
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:41,609
So, poor Scotland had to fund the project
herself. She gathered up all the money she

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,898
could, literally put it all in a big box and,
capital thusly raised, sent off a colonial

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:46,898
ship.

19
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:51,748
400,000 pounds, 8,000 kilometers and 111 days
later, 2,500 Scotsmen landed on the shores

20
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:55,468
of Panama, named it 'New Caledonia' and immediately
discovered a few small problems with their

21
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,759
plan:

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,499
First, the mountains on the western side of
Panama were a wee bit larger than expected,

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,108
making overland trade pretty much impossible.
Even if they had thought of building a canal,

24
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:06,258
the technology to do so was still 200 years
away.

25
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,019
Second, The woolen goods brought to trade
with the locals was useless in the endless

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,158
heat and humidity.

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,599
Third, the Spanish Conquistadors had already
planted flags on the sandy beaches and weren't

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,188
too happy to see the scots arrive.

29
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:19,029
And fourth, without adequate supplies, disease
such as the perennial tropical favorite, Dysentery,

30
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,109
spread quickly.

31
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,228
Two years and 2,000 dead scots later, they
abandoned the project.

32
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,438
Now, this wasn't the first failed attempt
at Scottish empire -- early colonies had been

33
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,779
tried and abandoned in Nova Scotia, New Jersey
and Carolina, but the Panama debacle was particularly

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,389
devastating to Scotland because she was over-invested.

35
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,139
Remember that money-in-a-box? Turns out it
was a fifth of the wealth of the whole country.

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,209
Oops.

37
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,960
Scotland's sudden impoverishment proved a
golden opportunity for The Kingdom of England

38
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:43,649
who was growing increasingly worried that
her neighbor to the North would ally with

39
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,649
an enemy.

40
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,939
England offered Scotland a deal that would
reimburse Scotland for her losses if she voted

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,599
for union. In 1707 Scotland agreed and the
Kingdom of Great Britain was born.

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,599
While the surrender of independence was unpopular
in Scotland, her economy improved with access

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,908
to once English (now British) trade routes
and she played a formative role in what would

44
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,239
soon be the largest empire in human history.

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,398
That being said, still more than 300 years
later, Scotland has never fully given up her

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,200
national identity and thoughts of independence.
