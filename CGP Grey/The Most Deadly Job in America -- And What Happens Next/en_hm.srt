1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,519
When the president dies, who becomes the president?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,049
Well, the Constitution says

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,329
what happens next is the vice president assumes

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,329
the powers and duties of the office.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,329
Simple enough, but one back-up president

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,589
is none back up president.

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,159
So what happens next next?

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,819
The Constitution left this question

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,549
as homework for the new Congress.

10
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,119
Important homework, yes.

11
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,389
Due date, no.

12
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,109
So Congress sort of worked on succession,

13
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,389
with inconsistent and conflicting drafts,

14
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,179
but mostly procrastinated on properly finishing

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,829
for two hundred years.

16
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,239
Finally turning in the 25th Amendment.

17
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,228
Better late than never.

18
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,269
Though, in the meantime,

19
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,779
a president had died in office

20
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,949
not once, not twice, not thrice, not quadrice,

21
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,989
not quintice, not hexice, nor septice, but octagonalice!

22
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,109
Four natural causes.

23
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,229
Four assassinations.

24
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,389
[It was Garfield and McKinley.]

25
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,049
This survival record was only 80%.

26
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,789
And even counting to today,

27
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,359
the president is technically

28
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,359
the most deadly job in America.

29
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,869
But the odds are, when you become president,

30
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,109
you must roll the celestial 2D6,

31
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,539
and if you roll a seven you die in office.

32
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,139
Whoof.

33
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,219
Don't spend a lot of time in Vegas with those odds.

34
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,479
So the veep becomes the peep

35
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,429
and picks a new veep

36
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,399
who must be confirmed by a majority vote

37
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,879
of both houses of Congress.

38
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,879
If this happens quickly, then hunky-dory.

39
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,159
Everything is reset.

40
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,349
But getting a VP nominee approved

41
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,599
might take some time,

42
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,119
during which the former VP,

43
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,279
who is now the president,

44
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,439
who is not immortal,

45
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,659
must cast the dice,

46
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,829
and could roll a seven.

47
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,119
The office of the vice president has been vacant

48
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,249
for more than a baker's dozen of times in United States history.

49
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,569
Which, given the historical state

50
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,989
of Congress's homework at the time,

51
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,039
put the peaceful transfer of power in a precarious position.

52
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,449
For example, the first time a president died in office

53
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,779
[the ninth, by the way, didn't even make it to double digits]

54
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,489
no one knew what should happen.

55
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,249
The then-VP just grabbed a judge to administer

56
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,529
the oath of the presidency to become number ten

57
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,309
and spent the rest of his term arguing with Congress

58
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,759
and the nation about if he was

59
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,679
really the president president

60
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,259
or the acting president.

61
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,949
Which seems a little, "Who cares? What's the difference?"

62
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,299
But there is the office of the president

63
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,939
and there are the powers and duties of the office,

64
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,029
which are not quite the same thing.

65
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,489
See, it's not just Death that can remove a president.

66
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,899
A president can resign.

67
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,269
A president can be impeached.

68
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,709
And a president can be "inable to discharge the powers and duties of the office."

69
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,089
This last inable is from the Constitution

70
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,199
which makes no attempt to define what inable means.

71
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,069
A president can volunteer themselves to be inable

72
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,629
[for example, during physical illness]

73
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,709
upon which they don't leave the office,

74
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,659
but the VP gets the powers and duties of the office

75
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,539
and becomes acting president.

76
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,789
This, on a tiny scale,

77
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,619
has happened a few times when the president

78
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,619
has undergone non-trivial surgery.

79
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,249
A reason for this being to ensure nuclear weapons

80
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,619
command and control is maintained at all times.

81
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,789
So don't get any ideas.

82
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,579
But also you don't get any ideas.

83
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,829
I'm still the president.

84
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,639
Power reverts as soon as this is over, and it will,

85
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,729
assuming Death doesn't make a bedside visit.

86
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,849
Anyway, 'inability' is a subjective sliding scale.

87
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,139
A president could be perceived as mentally inable [by some]

88
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,179
or become so mentally inable as to be unable

89
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,689
to declare themselves inable,

90
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,329
or become physically inable yet simply refuse to declare it.

91
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,049
Here the 25th Amendment allows for the vice president

92
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,509
to perform a kind of gentle coup.

93
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,069
Okay, the president has 15 top-level advisors we will get to later.

94
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,129
If the VP can get a majority of advisors

95
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,279
to state in writing the president is inable,

96
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,029
the VP gets the powers and duties of the office.

97
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,379
The president can challenge this,

98
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,719
getting a moment to try and consolidate keys to power,

99
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,759
but if the VP and advisors reaffirm the president is indeed inable,

100
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,429
the VP is acting president and a 21-day countdown clock begins.

101
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,649
What happens next is... up to Congress.

102
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,609
If they do nothing, when the clock runs out,

103
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,609
presidential power returns to the president.

104
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,689
But, if within the 21 days,

105
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,679
Congress votes with a two-thirds majority

106
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,309
that the president is inable,

107
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,249
then the vice president is permanently acting president.

108
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,939
And the president is still… around?

109
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,109
Awkward.

110
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,999
Obviously, this would be a real delicate maneuver

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,409
for any VP to pull off,

112
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,139
particularly as the president can dismiss their advisors

113
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,419
for any reason as long as the president

114
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,879
holds the powers and duties of the office.

115
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,109
So getting advisors on board would be challenging.

116
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,749
Case in point.

117
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,999
In 1919, the president suffered a stroke

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,939
and was mostly blinded and partly paralyzed.

119
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,939
And during this time there was no move by the VP

120
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,518
to declare the president inable.

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,079
But there might be a way around the VP.

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,919
The 25th has this line about Congress appointing like

123
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,199
its own committee to determine the president inable.

124
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,869
But the way it's worded is a little unclear.

125
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,679
Does it mean:

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,299
The VP AND (advisors OR Congress committee) determine inability?

127
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,099
Or does it mean:

128
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,419
the (VP AND advisors) OR Congress committee?

129
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,749
If the latter interpretation, that means Congress alone

130
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,029
has the power to appoint a committee with the

131
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,649
power to remove the power of the president... unilaterally.

132
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,289
But, as always, with unclear interpretations,

133
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,959
were they to happen for realzies,

134
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,629
someone might want to weigh in on it.

135
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,899
So those are the four (or five?)

136
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,579
ways a president can get removed from office.

137
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,699
But one of them is clearly the most popular,

138
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,339
so let's talk about what the finished

139
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,589
congressional homework says about succession.

140
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,579
First, the doubt that began with President Ten

141
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,099
is dispelled by the 25th.

142
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,869
"When the president dies, the vice president becomes the president president."

143
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,499
Inable equals VP acting president.

144
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,309
Dead equals VP president president.

145
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,179
But if both the president and the vice roll sevens,

146
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,669
the order of succession is set.

147
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,399
And first up is the Speaker, who is the elected leader

148
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,279
from within the House of Representatives.

149
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,939
And next is the President Pro Tempore of the Senate,

150
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,889
who is the longest-serving senator,

151
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,499
not automatically, but elected by tradition.

152
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,979
[Gee that's a funny thing to mention now. I'm sure it won't matter later.]

153
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,069
Senators tend to serve for a long time,

154
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,849
so the President Pro Tempore is often in their eighties,

155
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,339
with the record holder being 98.

156
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,349
Just worth noting it was up to Congress to set succession order

157
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,109
and Congress just so happened to pick

158
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,969
the two most powerful members of Congress

159
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,759
as next in line from the VP.

160
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,219
After Congress, succession moves to the Cabinet.

161
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,289
These are the advisors mentioned before.

162
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,279
Each here has the title of Secretary

163
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,999
and are Secretary of a same name department.

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,979
Explaining each in detail would take too long,

165
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,249
because it would be to explain

166
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,499
the entire structure of the Executive Branch,

167
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,089
which is enormous.

168
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,999
And some of their names give you the idea,

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,969
but some of them don't.

170
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,679
For example, number four in line, the Secretary of State

171
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,929
who runs the Department of State,

172
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,319
which has nothing to do with the states,

173
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,189
but everything outside the states.

174
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,559
The Secretary of State is first in the Cabinet because

175
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,539
managing the foreign relations of the federal government

176
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,629
is a pretty big deal that requires you to be on

177
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,289
at least decent speaking terms with other countries.

178
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,809
A good thing, should say, you need their support

179
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,679
during a sudden transition of power.

180
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,369
The Secretary of State is first among

181
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,959
the founding four appointed by the first president.

182
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,559
The others: Secretary of Treasury,

183
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,839
Secretary of War, and Secretary of Justice.

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,069
Oh wait, fancy pants here wants to be called

185
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,109
The Attorney General,

186
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,049
but just so happens to be in charge of

187
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,399
the Department of Justice.

188
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,399
So the oldest departments have their secretaries in

189
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,399
four-five-six-seven order of succession.

190
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,839
Now from here, Congress decided

191
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,669
the rest should continue on seniority.

192
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,129
Not for people, but departments.

193
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,129
Which has led to an… interesting order.

194
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,059
Secretary of the Interior is next up because in the 1800s

195
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,079
young America realized she had a lot of interior land to manage

196
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,809
and created the Department of the Interior to manage the land

197
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,089
and the Indians on the land.

198
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,709
[No, there's no time.]

199
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,739
And land needs to farmed and managed,

200
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,069
so the Department of Agriculture.

201
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,439
And then in 1900s part one,

202
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,969
America wanted to develop Commerce and Labor.

203
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,769
And part two, Health and Human Services.

204
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,199
And Housing and Urban Development.

205
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,849
And oh right, Transportation between those urban developments.

206
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,849
Oh and Energy for those developments

207
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,129
and overseeing nuclear weapons.

208
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:29,939
[There really isn't time!]

209
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,009
And Education.

210
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,809
Meanwhile, that Department of War, renamed Department of Defense,

211
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,089
created veterans and so also the Department of Veterans Affairs.

212
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,639
All done until 2001.

213
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,859
Department of Homeland Security.

214
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,599
So the order is more historical-happenstance-order,

215
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,429
not legislators-sat-down-and-thought-it-through-order.

216
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,909
Not to cast shade on the Secretary of Education,

217
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,369
but if something has happened where the first 15 backups

218
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,059
are out of order,

219
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,019
that sounds a lot like a Homeland Security issue.

220
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,019
In addition to the debatable order,

221
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,089
for everyone below VP, if their spot in succession comes up,

222
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,109
they are required to resign their current position to become

223
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,049
[wait for it]

224
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,469
acting president.

225
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,249
Most likely serving the rest of the president's term.

226
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,439
Why most likely?

227
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,109
Well, one of Congress's homework attempts

228
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:23,919
raises an issue called bumping with this paragraph, saying,

229
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,399
[wearily]
Ugh, it's another interpretation problem.

230
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,619
This does or doesn't mean

231
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,099
new appointees take priority and bump

232
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,699
those lower on the list out of the office instantly.

233
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,479
Here's the worst case interpretation and scenario.

234
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,389
Imagine while Congress is on recess,

235
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,298
the president, VP, both leaders of Congress

236
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,579
and the Secretary of State all roll sevens.

237
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,979
The Secretary of Treasury becomes acting president

238
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,979
and appoints a new Secretary of State,

239
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,749
who is higher on the list, bumping the acting Treasury president off,

240
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,749
who is now unemployed, at least until reconfirmed.

241
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,429
And of course, a new Secretary of State is needed posthaste, confirmed.

242
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,559
Back from recess, the Senate elects a new President Pro Tempore,

243
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,999
who is higher on the list and then must resign to become acting president,

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,719
bumping the current acting president,

245
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,429
who was the Secretary of State but is now just unemployed.

246
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,809
And then the House elects their new Speaker.

247
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,969
Bump again.

248
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,749
While there is debate about bumping constitutionality,

249
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,419
the point is, it's still President Ten all over again.

250
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,899
Uncertainty is the whole problem.

251
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,039
After a government decapitation,

252
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,439
just the potential of rapid-fire changes in power

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,639
is exactly what you don't want to be even debatable

254
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,749
when nuclear command and control is on the table

255
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,649
in what would obviously be trying times.

256
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,909
So maybe a couple more revisions on that homework are due?

257
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,639
But whatever.

258
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,309
This is the current order.

259
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,809
And since the 1950s

260
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,049
[for no particular reason]

261
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,299
it's been policy to never let all of these people

262
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,929
in a room together at once.

263
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,239
So when you're watching the next State of the Union Address,

264
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,589
if you want something to occupy your mind during all the clapping,

265
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,889
you can play Guess Who's the Designated Survivor.

266
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,229
Knocking down successors as you spot them to figure out who isn't there,

267
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,560
secreted away in a secure location to be the final backup.
