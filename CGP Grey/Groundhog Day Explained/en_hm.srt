00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,380
February is home to one of the most important
holidays of the year not to forget: Groundhog

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:05,380
Day.

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:08,419
If you live outside of Can-merica then you
might not know what a groundhog is so...

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,699
here you go: this is a groundhog.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,928
They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who
dig burrows underground.

6
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,928
Burrows large enough, in fact, to occasionally
make their comfy home a structural hazard

7
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,299
to your comfy home.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,788
This explains the first half of their name.

9
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:23,169
The second half is because they're kind of
fat -- though unlike their fellow Can-mericans

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,399
-- when winter arrives they need their excess
weight to go into hibernation.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,059
The story of the holiday is that on February
2nd the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,118
to peek out of their burrow and look at the
world.

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,409
If they see their shadow they go back inside
which predicts six more weeks of winter.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,999
If they don't, then spring will come early.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,019
The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania
Dutch custom of weather prediction and today

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,519
is celebrated in Canada and 49 of the fifty
states, the exception being Alaska which in

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,189
2009 decided to forgo groundhog day in favor
of marmot day.

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,189
Outside of Alaska, many groundhogs contend
with each other to be the King of Seasonal

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,459
Weather prediction their their main weapon
in this war being their delightful names such

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,459
as:

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,059
Queen Charlotte and Sir Walter Wally in North
Carolina,

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,549
Shubenacadie Sam of Nova Scotia

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,929
Staten Island Chuck from New York

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,689
French Creek Freddie in West Virginia

25
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,689
And...

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,759
Gus from Athens Georgia though this last groundhog
is somewhat overshadowed by his neighbor,

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,279
General Beauregard Lee, who one must assume
has stylish facial hair and fans himself on

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,890
the veranda of his plantation home while drinking
Mint Julep and pining for the day when the

29
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,158
south will rise again.

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,459
1,000 miles north of the General, Wiarton
Willie is the groundhog king of Canada, who

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,949
throws an annual party to help him stay on
top and make sure that people keep building

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,439
epic statues of him.

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,489
But, if there could be only one, Punxsutawney
Phil would be him.

34
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,499
Not only is his name the most fun to say but
he also has quite a posse of top-hatted, tuxedoed

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,269
men who look after him and call themselves
the inner circle.

36
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,859
According to them, Punxsutawney Phil has been
making predictions since the 1880s.

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,749
Not a Punxsutawney Phil, mind you, but this
Punxsutawney Phil who is functionally immortal

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,219
because of a magic life-extending elixir the
inner circle members prepare for him so that

39
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,389
he can continue to make predictions -- and
bring in tourist revenue -- until the end

40
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,389
of time.

41
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,169
He also speaks a language called groundhogese
that only the president of the inner circle

42
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,529
can understand.

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,269
If you think that Groundhog day is a dumb,
pointless holiday then, there are two things

44
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,269
you should consider:

45
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,059
1st: you have no sense of fun and 2nd, you
better be careful on Groundhog day, because

46
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,158
in addition to their weather predicting day
jobs, these groundhogs also have the magical

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,008
power to trap you in a infinite time loop
until you learn to be less of a jerk.

48
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,709
Happy Groundhog Dayï¿½
