00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,269
These books are all about this ring. How it's
found and [spoiler alert] how it's destroyed.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,169
While Tolkien built the largest and most consistent
fictional universe he sure didn't mind being

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,449
vague at times -- so if you finished the story
and then thought: wait, what can this ring

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,409
do and where did it come from? This is your
video.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,598
First thing first: The One Ring is not the
only ring -- it's Lord of the Ring*s*, after

6
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:22,698
all -- and that lord is Sauron.

7
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:26,178
Long before this story starts, Sauron disguised
himself and came to the elves to work with

8
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,778
their master craftsman Celebrimbor to forge
the rings of power. Together they made 16

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,709
-- called the lesser rings, then Celebrimbor
took Sauron's formula and made three on his

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,999
own that turned out more powerful than the
original 16.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,909
Why make rings based on the suggestion of
a stranger whose resume has a millennia-long

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,529
gap? Because he promised the rings would fix
the Elves biggest problem: this world is winding

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,439
down. The amount of big and awesome and magic
decreases as a function of time here.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,349
For elves, magic *immortal* creatures, this
is bad news. Sauron said the rings would preserve

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,539
what their wearers cared about most. That's
why the Elven kingdoms are so fantastical

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,959
compared to the rest of the world -- their
rings have preserved them

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,809
Unlike the famous poem implies, the elves
made all the rings for themselves intending

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,538
exactly 0 to get into the hands of men or
dwarves, whom the elves think are stinky -- so

19
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:17,478
obviously something went wrong. Which brings
us back to The One Ring to rule them all.

20
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,279
Sauron's chief ability's is to dominate the
minds of others -- that's partly why he's

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,408
able to control such large armies -- and he
secretly made the The One Ring as a kind of

22
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,938
lens to focus this power -- his formula for
ring construction, unknown to Celebrimbor,

23
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,648
also made the wearers of the nineteen rings
more vulnerable.

24
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:37,178
Basically: The One Ring buffs his psy attack
and the other rings debuf psy defense.

25
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:41,118
Plan A was to control a bunch of high-level
elves. But when he put The One ring on, the

26
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,248
elves' base-level stats allowed them to resist
and take off their rings just in time.

27
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:49,339
Sauron captured Celebrimbor and tortured him
until he gave up the 16 lesser rings -- but

28
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,078
he died before revealing who was protecting
the three most powerful ones.

29
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,358
So Sauron now had 16 mind-controlling rings
and had to turn to plan B: dwarves.

30
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,068
Sauron manipulated sevens rings into the hands
of the dwarven kings but that didn't work

31
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,498
well either -- Dwarves are a kind of clockwork
creature Sauron found impossible to control.

32
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:11,329
But the rings weren't super helpful for dwarves
either who loved treasure above all else so

33
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,829
the rings grew their hordes large enough to
attract dragons who ate the dwarves and their

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,909
precious rings.

35
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,039
Finally, in the hands of men, ever the corruptible
species, the rings worked as expected: Sauron

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,749
controlled their minds. And, as mortals, they
valued their lives the most, which the rings

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,069
stretched for 1,000s of years. Stretched so
thin the men turn into invisible wraiths.

38
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,279
Anyway, these domination plans don't go unnoticed,
there�s a big war -- Sauron is defeated

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,389
and fades and The One Ring is lost.

40
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,369
But the One ring is tricksy. It has a mind
of its own and wants to get back to Sauron,

41
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,569
which brings us back to its powers:

42
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,789
First: the ring tempts everyone (Well, almost
everyone) with promises that, yes this little

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,259
ring can be a mighty weapon or a tool to reshape
the world, and gosh, don't you just look like

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,069
the best guy to use it? Let's go vanquish
the powerful-demigod who lives over there

45
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,979
to get started, shall we. Hmmm?

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,730
This is why the Hobbits made great ring bearers:
because they're pretty happy with the way

47
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:03,819
things are and don't aspire to greatness.
Of course, there's Gollum who started out

48
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,989
as a hobbit, but all things considered he
held out pretty well for a couple hundred

49
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,619
years. Set the ring on the desk of most men
and they wouldn't be able to finish their

50
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,469
coffee before heading to Mordor to rule the
world and do it right this time.

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,409
It's worth considering that The One Ring's
promises are just lies -- that no one could

52
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,829
*really* overthrow Sauron with it -- The Ring
only wants to trick its wearer to get found

53
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,419
which brings us to...

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,419
Invisibility.

55
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,579
Which outside the minds of characters, is
the only, tangible power the ring displays

56
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,119
for everyone else -- Invisibility seems great
-- but while you're hiding from that troll

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,539
you shine like a beacon in the unseen world.
Where the, also invisible ring wraiths, can

58
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,729
easily spot you.

59
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,729
In summary:

60
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,209
The One Ring
a) Turns you invisible in the most unhelpful

61
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,859
manner
b) Is probably filled with lies, because

62
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,789
c) It's part of Sauron and works for him.

63
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,339
He's so connected to it, that its destruction
ends him for good. But the formula also intertwines

64
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,568
The One Ring with all the rest. And so when
it fails, so do they.

65
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:06,009
This is why the elves are *so somber*. Victory
over Sauron also means that the rings won't

66
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,689
preserve their kingdoms anymore -- and all
will diminish. These books are the end of

67
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,039
the age of magic and the beginning of the
age of men.
