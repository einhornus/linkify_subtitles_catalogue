1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,339
Primary elections are how political parties
in the United States pick their strongest

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,009
candidate to run for president.
The parties do this by holding mini-elections

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,529
in each of the states and the candidates with
the most votes from these elections becomes

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,269
the parties’ official nominees; these nominees
then face each other in the national election

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,999
for president.
But this isn’t the whole story. There are

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,219
five things that make it a bit more complicated
than that…

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,159
Complication #1: Primaries vs Caucuses
In every state, the local party leaders decide

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,139
how to run their elections. The two most common
choices are primaries and caucuses.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,509
Primaries are just like standard elections.
Go to the polls whenever you can, stand in

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,569
a long line, hide in a booth, then tick a
box or press a button and your vote is cast

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,209
in complete anonymity.
A Caucus, however, is a public vote.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,629
People gather in groups wherever space is
available then literally take sides in the

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,199
room with everyone else who likes the same
candidate.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,569
The groups debate each other and, if people
change their minds, they need to physically

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,619
switch sides.
At the end of the debates party representatives

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,578
count the number of people in each group.
If you leave too early, you don’t count.

17
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,459
This description of primaries and caucuses
is really all you need to know but the specifics

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,178
can vary wildly.
That’s because there are fifty states all

19
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:09,888
of which hold at least two primaries and caucuses
for the big parties, and possibly more for

20
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:12,188
the small parties.
Covering all the local variants would take

21
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:15,908
a tediously long time which your short attention
span for boring political videos wouldn’t

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,629
tolerate – And you need to stay focused
because there are four more things to cover.

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,028
Complication #2: Who can vote?
In the National Presidential election all

24
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:27,349
American citizens over the age of 18 can vote,
with two exceptions, you can’t live here

25
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,728
or here.
But primaries are in-state elections with

26
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,688
lots of different rules.
Most states and parties will only let you

27
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,568
vote in the primary if you are an official
member of the party. This is called a closed

28
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:39,938
primary because the voting is closed to non-party
members.

29
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:43,489
But some citizens are independents – and
are not registered with any party. If you’re

30
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,068
an independent and live in a state with closed-party
elections, tough luck. No voting for you.

31
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:51,129
Some states, however, have ‘semi-closed’
primaries. Where independents can pick one,

32
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,188
and only one, primary to vote in. Parties
allow this because the presidential election

33
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:59,248
is often determined by independents so knowing
which candidates they like is useful.

34
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:03,339
Finally a few states and parties really play
it fast and lose with open primaries. Here

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,938
any citizen, no matter which party they’re
registered with, can pick a primary to vote

36
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,059
in.
But it’s not just the states that have primaries,

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,819
they’re also held in the District of Columbia
and the oft-forgotten territories – holding

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,609
primaries here is a bit odd though considering
that territorial residents can’t vote in

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,669
the actual presidential election.
Lastly are the Americans living abroad who,

40
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,059
depending on the party, vote in a bloc as
though they all lived together in one a big,

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,169
extra state.
When all these elections take place depends

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,719
on…
Complication #3 Who Votes When?

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,219
Primaries aren’t conducted all at once but
are spread out over a year. This leads to

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,359
fights between the states about who gets to
be at the head of the line and who is stuck

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,579
at the back. Inevitably, last minute leap-frogging
of dates happens – even though the parties

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,439
often take away votes from these uncivil states.
When it comes to being #1, nobody beats New

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,989
Hampshire who wrote it into state law that
their primary will always be at least a week

48
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,109
ahead of everyone else’s.
Which isn’t a problem until some other state

49
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,439
gets the bright idea to do the same and then
we have an infinite loop in our system and

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,999
have to force-quit the law.
But wait, you say, doesn’t Iowa already

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,879
go first? Yes, but New Hampshire lets them
get away with it for two reasons:

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,579
1) Iowa’s election is a caucus and so New
Hampshire is still technically the first primary.

53
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,669
and
2) New Hampshire thinks that Iowa is stupid

54
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,349
and doesn’t matter.
Other states try to boost their influence

55
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,579
not by cutting in line but by forming an alliance
and holding their primaries at the same time.

56
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,139
The biggest alliance of the election cycle
is called Super Tuesday where – depending

57
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,619
on how many states can agree with each other
– around half of them might participate,

58
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,409
giving out a whole pile of votes.
Which brings us to:

59
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,589
Complication #4: Votes That Aren’t Votes.
So this whole time you’re were probably

60
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,689
thinking that citizens give votes straight
to the candidates, but no.

61
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,029
Instead, the votes are given to a bunch of
guys, called delegates, who in turn will give

62
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,089
them to candidates as requested to. Maybe.
Depending on the state, delegates might be

63
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,679
required to vote as the citizens did, or they
might be completely free to ignore the citizens

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,379
and vote for whomever they want.
Who are these people? The delegates are local

65
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,899
party VIPs, such as state reps and officials.
The more citizens who live in a state, the

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,068
more delegates that state gets.
Later in the year, when all the states have

67
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,529
finished their primaries, the delegates travel
to a huge gathering for their party called

68
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,559
the National Convention.
It’s here that the official vote to select

69
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,329
the party’s nominee for president happens.
But it’s not just these delegates who do

70
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,149
the voting.
Complication #5 Super Delegates

71
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,409
Super delegates are the top members of the
party such as congressmen and former presidents.

72
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,028
They go to the National Convention, not to
represent the people, but to represent the

73
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,328
current party establishment and can vote for
whomever they want.

74
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,709
Depending on the party, the super delegates
might be up to 20% of the voters at the National

75
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,329
Convention.
Usually by the time the national convention

76
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,918
happens all the candidates save one have dropped
out of the race so the convention is just

77
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,019
a rubber stamp and a big party. But if the
fight between candidates is still ongoing,

78
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,269
the delegates and super delegates are the
ones with the final decision.

79
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,269
In summary:
Over the course of a year the states, plus,

80
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,179
DC plus the territories, and the Americans
Abroad hold their primaries, or caucuses.

81
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,138
When finished the delegates representing the
citizens who voted in those elections travel

82
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,498
to the national convention. Most of the delegates
are forced to vote as the citizens of their

83
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,948
state wanted them to, but some of them are
free to vote as they like.

84
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,769
At the national convention the delegates meet
up with the super delegates who represent

85
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,628
the best interests of the party and together
they make the final decision on who will be

86
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,728
the nominee for president.
Tired? Don’t be, because now the race for

87
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:14,859
the presidency begins.
Of course, you can skip all that and jump

88
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,239
straight into the election as an independent,
the only downside to this strategy is near-certain

89
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,560
defeat.
