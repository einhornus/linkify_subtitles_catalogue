1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,959
How many continents are there? If you grew
up in the English-Speaking world you might

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,879
think that the answer is obvious: 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,838
But not everyone count continents the same
way.

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:14,248
The usual deffiniton, that they’re large
land masses separated from others by oceans

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:17,929
is fine, until you actually start to think
about it, and then you run into problems.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,969
Problems, like, this:

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,789
Here’s Europe, here’s Asia and you’ll
notice the lack of ocean between them. Why

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,569
then, are they two different continents?

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,339
The usual reason for this split is a cultural
one: that Europe is so different from Asia

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,679
that it’s best to pretend it’s a separate
entity.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,829
OK... maybe.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,968
But if the cultural argument is valid then
surely it also applies to India and the middle

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,799
east. Now you have nine continents and a new
problem: if culture defines continents then

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,588
you’ll never stop drawing increasingly unhelpful
lines.

15
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:46,459
So some places ditch the culture division
and combine Europe and Asia into Eurasia.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,889
This Eurasia is not to be confused with this
Eurasia, which has always been at war with

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,919
Eastasia
Making Eurasia gives a six continent view

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,919
of the world.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,068
But what about over here: North America and
South America?

20
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:59,908
They’re connected at Panama – or at least
they were until Teddy Roosevelt decided that

21
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,478
someone had to cut that country in half and
it might as well be him.

22
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,389
But even still the Canal is only 13 meters
deep.

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,239
You could walk all the way from Northern Alaska
across the narrow Panama canal and, if it

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,829
weren’t for the deadly, impenetrable, poison
filled Brazilian rain forest, make it all

25
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,609
the way to the southern tip of Chile. So North
and South America, despite the canal, aren’t

26
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,829
really divided.
Which is why some places, particularly South

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,779
America, treat America as a single continent,
not two. Which brings the total number of

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,809
continents down to five.

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,139
But... if you discard the Panama Canal then
you also have to discard the Suez Canal and

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,169
you’ve just created the monstrously large
Afro-Eurasian continent: 85 million square

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,209
kilometers home to 5.7 billion people.

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,619
With this four-continent view of the world
we must be done because there are no more

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,249
continents to merge and our deffiniton from
the beginning is now consistent.

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,269
Except we’re not done because of that troublesome
word 'large'. Exactly how large is continental

35
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,359
large?

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,239
Is Australia really a dinky continent or is
it the king of the Islands? Why not make Greenland

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,169
the smallest continent? It’s pretty big,
even if you took away its ice.

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,679
And speaking of ice, what about Antarctica?
The forgotten continent unfairly smushed against

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,429
the bottom of maps just because no one lives
there.

40
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,899
Remove the ice sheet that covers Antarctica
and you reveal it for the archipelago it really

41
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,969
is not the single land mass it pretends to
be.

42
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,219
And, to complicate matters, the largest of
these Antarctic Islands is smaller than Australia.

43
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,369
So if you want to keep calling Antarctica
a continent, then there’s a bunch of other

44
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,369
islands that might want to be continents too.

45
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,129
Islands like New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar,
Baffin Island, Sumatra, and Honshu.

46
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,799
While this seems inclusive to the point of
silliness, ultimately someone has to decide

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,859
what ‘large’ means and that’s going
to be an arbitrary line.

48
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,439
This problem will be familiar to anyone who
remembers the is-Pluto-a-planet-or-not-a-planet

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,129
fiasco which hinged -- mostly -- on this same
issue of size.

50
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,579
So now we’re more confused than before we
started: there might be three continents or

51
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,649
dozens. You know what will sort this out:

52
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,909
SCIENCE!

53
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,079
Confusion + science = answers

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,969
Let’s ask a Geologist what a continent is.

55
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,359
For them a continent is a tectonic plate:
parts of the Earth’s crust that move together.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,749
So, geologists, show us your continents.

57
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,329
The Antarctic, plate, the Australian plate,
the Eurasian plate, the South American plate,

58
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,879
the African plate. So far, this looks pretty
good.

59
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,079
The... middle eastern plate. The... indian
plate. The Caribbean plate?

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,429
The pacific plate? Well, there isn’t even
anything there.

61
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,639
Well, there’s mostly nothing there. The
Nazca plate? The scotia plate? Really?

62
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,189
At least North America is still lookin’
reasonable. Until you include a chuck of Russia,

63
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,068
and half of japan and half of Iceland!

64
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,669
Well, this is unhelpful -- thanks a lot, Geologists.

65
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,739
The heart of the problem is that the word
'continent' doesn’t have a simple & consistent

66
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,189
deffiniton for every day use. So how many
continents are there? Well, how many do you

67
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:46,829
want there to be?

68
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,260
Six. The answer is clearly six.�
