00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,129
10) The Great Wall of China is the only man-made
object visible from space.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,808
To see something on Earth from space, it would
have to be pretty big, which the great wall

3
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,149
of China all 5,000 miles of it certainly is.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,569
But, it’s only 30 feet across at its widest.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,488
Here’s a photo taken from the International
Space station, 200 miles above Earth.

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,329
Can you spot the great wall amid the mountain
tops?

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,329
Here, right?

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,789
No, that’s a river, the wall is actually
here.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,149
Even if you guessed the right lines buy pure
luck, this photo was taken with a zoom lens,

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,049
so from the window of the space station it
looks more like this – which pretty clearly

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,439
makes the Great Wall count as ‘not visible.’

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,139
As for the man-made part of this misconception
our glorious man-made cities blasting light

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,689
into the void certainly are visible.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,459
9) Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis.

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,459
Socially obnoxious?

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,459
Yes.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,599
Gives you arthritis later in life as karmic
punishment?

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,619
No.
8) People Only Use 10% of their Brain

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,559
If you haven’t seen a medical drama in the
past oh, 30 years, you might not be aware

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,479
that doctors now have machines that can see
inside peoples’ brains and, contrary to

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,368
popular, belief 90% of the neurons don’t
sit all day around doing nothing.

22
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,859
While scientists don’t yet know exactly
what each part does, they do know that all

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,859
the bits matter.

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,218
So if you think someone could scoop out 90%
of your brain and you’d still be just fine,

25
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,309
then perhaps you really do only use 10% of
it.

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,978
7) Eskimos have Hundreds of words for snow
This one is technically correct, but misleading.

27
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,998
Some languages, such as German, like to make
compound words by running several smaller

28
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,658
ones together which is why German words are
sometimes absurdly long.

29
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,158
Inuit languages use compound words as well
so rather than say ‘yellow snow’ as you

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,809
would in English an Inuit speaker combines
the two words into one, but it’s not really

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,908
a new word, just a quirk of grammar.

32
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,748
So technically Eskimos do have 100s of ways
to describe snow… but then so does every

33
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:40,748
language.

34
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:44,359
6) You Need 8 Glasses of Water a Day
While doubtless some people would benefit

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,928
from drinking more water and drinking less
crap there is no scientific evidence that

36
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:52,278
8 glasses of water a day is the required amount
and some evidence that it might be too much.

37
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,068
And while we’re talking about water…

38
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:58,758
5) Tap Water is Bad but Bottled Water is Good
If you live in a paradise free from Government

39
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,459
regulations like, say, Somalia, then you might
have good reason to prefer bottled water over

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,459
tap.

41
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,389
But modern, functioning countries have something
called health regulations which cover both

42
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,799
kinds of water.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,929
Also, water is extremely dense making transporting
it from those pristine mountain tops and glaciers

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,389
enormously expensive which is why bottled
water companies don’t bother.

45
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,999
‘Bottled’ water is often just local tap
water with a fancy label and an enormous markup.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,469
4) Gum takes seven years to pass through your
digestive system.

47
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,919
This is pretty easy to disprove yourself but
it’s understandable why most people don’t

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,289
try the experiment.

49
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,799
3) Blood in Your Veins is Blue
The idea here is that the blood in veins is

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,369
blue and it only turns red when exposed to
the oxygen in the air.

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,629
Thinking this isn’t unreasonable, after
all your veins look blue and medical diagrams

52
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,359
show arteries as red and veins as blue, but
it’s the same mistake as thinking that mountain

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,959
dew is green because it’s in a green bottle.

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,319
Pour it out and you discover that Mountain
Dew is really piss yellow, which is probably

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,289
the reason it’s in a green bottle to begin
with.

56
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,579
The next time you get blood withdrawn from
a veins take a look.

57
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,579
What color it is?

58
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,579
Red.

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,009
How much oxygen is inside a good syringe?

60
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,009
None.

61
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,019
Unless you’re a Horseshoe crab or Plavalaguna
you’re blood isn’t blue.

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,719
2) Fan Death
This misconception is a specialty of South

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,719
Korea.

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,309
Here the belief is that if you spend too much
time with a rotating fan in a confined space,

65
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,499
it will use up all your oxygen and you’ll
asphyxiate to death.

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,949
Exactly how the fan made of lifeless, anaerobic
plastic, competes for your oxygen is unclear,

67
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,859
but hilariously South Korean fan manufacturers
– who surely must know better – include

68
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,689
timers on fans to prevent them from running
too long.

69
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,009
1) People Swallow 8 Spiders a Year While Sleeping
Supposedly while you’re in bed, helplessly

70
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,589
unconscious with your gob wide open, each
year eight spiders find their way into your

71
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,489
mouth and you reflexively swallow them.

72
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,349
This is plainly ridiculous: spiders love warm,
moist places so eight is far too low an estimate.
