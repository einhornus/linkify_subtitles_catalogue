1
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:08,279
History has a long and rich tradition of apocalyptic
predictions – all of which were wrong – yet

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,119
some people still think that this time ’round
in 2012 is the real deal.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,309
Why 2012?

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,189
Because of ancient Mayan calendars.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,218
Obviously.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,769
Mayan calendars not only recorded the days
and years, but also longer cycles of about

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,769
5 Millennia.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,549
So they could easily make calendars that went
1,000s of years into the future.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,819
But, of course, 1,000s of years in the future
from 1,000s of years ago brings us to current

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,489
times when the Mayan calendars stop in 2012.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,099
Modern new-agey people decided that the wise
Mayans stopped making calendars because they

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,829
knew when the world would end.

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,799
And because new agers are happy – though
scientifically illiterate – people their

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,409
vision of 2012 was a great spiritual awakening
or world reboot or other hippy-consciousness-expanding

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,439
nonsense that the Mayans, who spent time puling
strings of thorns through peoples’ tongue,

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,039
probably didn’t have in mind.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,869
To a normal person the thought that: calendar
finishes therefore end of the world is an

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,619
odd conclusion to draw.

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,468
After all, the amount of time in the Universe
is infinite and the amount of stone is limited.

20
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,879
So, at some point the Mayans had to stop carving
calendars.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,879
But never mind.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,169
What should have stayed a fringe belief turned
into mass hysteria with the 2012 disaster

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,609
movie that swept the academy awards and the
numerous emmy-nominated apocalypse documentaries

24
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,049
on
::sigh::

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,769
The History Channel.

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,439
What happened to you guys?

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,439
Anyway.

28
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,769
After this NASA became so inundated with questions
that they had to take time away from their

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,969
busy robot building, frontier pushing, knowledge
expanding, civilization inspiring schedule,

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,719
to write a webpage explaining that no, a human-sacrificing,
stone-age society with neither wheels to pull

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,469
carts nor glass to make telescopes, didn’t
know more about science at the dawn of history

32
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,549
than real scientists do today.

33
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,749
But the parade of crazy marched on anyway
making wilder and wilder predictions for Earth

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,269
including:
• Geomagnetic Reversal (a process that unfolds

35
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,478
on a geologic timescale, not a single day)
• A collision with mysterious Planet X (That

36
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,579
no astronomers have found)
• A local star going supernova (Despite

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,398
there being no such candidates)
• An Alien Invasion (Which is ludicrous

38
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,449
on the face of it… or is it?)

39
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,089
• And a galactic synchronization beam, whatever
the hell that is.

40
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,689
A sane person, at this point, would wonder
how the Mayans were able to predict astro-physical

41
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,079
anomalies thousands of years in advance and
millions of miles away yet didn’t foresee

42
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,109
the Spanish coming across the Atlantic.

43
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,969
And that’s because the Mayans never predicted
apocalypse.

44
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,780
The only people to claim the Mayans knew about
the end of the world were distinctly not Mayans.�
