00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,819
Hello Internet!

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,259
I asked for questions, and boy, did you deliver

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,139
with more than 7,000, so, let's get started.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,979
:Question

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,819
Immortality!

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,139
Aging is a degenerative fatal disease of the genes in the same way Parkinson's is.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,579
We're trying to cure Parkinson's with gene therapy along with Leukemia, Multiple Melanoma and others.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,919
Why not aging?

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,459
Well, because most people think of getting old and dying as a beautiful part of the life cycle.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,019
IT ISN'T

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,259
With 30 years of genius, we could grasp control of our genetics, and gain eternity.

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,819
Question:

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,039
I'm not sold on overpopulation as a problem.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,939
Birth rates have been going nothing but down

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,519
and until we build that "Dyson Sphere" we aren't anywhere near the carrying capacity of the Solar System

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,679
and, immortality is exactly the sort of thing that makes crazy, long-term sustainability projects possible.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,599
:Question

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,399
Scary experiences increase the probability of bonding. This explains horror movies.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,339
If you want the date to go well, do them. If you don't, don't.

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,559
:Question

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,639
I'm sure I've answered this before, but everyone keeps asking, so here's the whole story in one place:

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,019
I grew up in the Empire State, starting in the suburbs.... which I didn't like that much

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,299
then went to college in the wilds of upstate, which I liked better. But, it wasn't "for me" forever so next stop, big city.

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,419
New York was the obvious choice, but, because I was raised in its shadow, New York felt a bit like a step backward in life.

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,039
I discovered around this time I had Irish dual citizenship through a series of random events, which opened up the EU, and her largest city, London.

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,479
I knew if I didn't live abroad while still free of life's anchors, I never would, which made it all the more reason to go.

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,839
I applied to an Economics Masters program in London, was accepted, and went and stayed for more than a decade.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,119
It turned out great! When you're leaving school, try the adventurous path! You can always fall back on the known later.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,119
Question:

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,559
Sounds like we're in a dangerous place, sounds like I need to keep that antivenim..while I go...get help *laughs*

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,939
Question:

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,179
So, I *do* have two podcasts that I'm putting on the screen now that you should totally click and go listen to.

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,919
YouTube is how I spend most of my work energy, despite what you might think from the CGP Grey Reddit posts but,

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,399
podcasts allow me to, with fewer of my hours, make *lots* of hours of stuff for other people to enjoy.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:14,579
Ostensibly, I'm doing this Q&A because I hit two million subscribers, but I'm way more impressed that these short videos, according to Youtube, have engaged more than a millennia of human attention.

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,659
At least, I was impressed until I did some back of the envelope calculations and realized that the podcast has eaten up 3 millenia of human attention,

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,879
Which makes the time-return on my time for podcasting, astounding.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,239
So the bottom line is that these projects are rewarding in different ways

39
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,119
Have you clicked yet?

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,619
Go Click.

41
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,639
Seriously, do it right now.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,459
I'd love to see this number get even bigger.

43
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,759
Question:

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,539
Of course.

45
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,679
Question:

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,939
Standardized tests measure how good you are at school.

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,699
Same with your report card.

48
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,699
They don't measure your understanding

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,039
and once you accept that they're easier to deal with.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,859
Question:

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,759
Modem sounds. *beep boop beep tchhhhhhkkk* [Grey makes modem sounds]

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,959
Question:

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,819
4, 5, 6, 7

54
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,419
Question:

55
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,059
I measure success by what percent of my time I have control over.

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,279
Reaching 100% isn't possible, but on average I've been getting closer.

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,859
If this is your goal too: beware the money trap.

58
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,859
I've always preferred jobs that earned less if they gave me more time -- which didn't pay off in the short term, but did in the long term.

59
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,439
The holidays are like 80% of the reason I went into teaching.

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,679
Question:

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,919
Watch the Dog Whisperer.  I am deadly serious about this.

62
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,539
It's also my advice for new parents.

63
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,079
Question:

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,559
Last Q&A video I mentioned opinions and how to change them.  The hardest changes are the ones where you're invested in the idea.

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,339
And I've been a techno-optimist 100% all of my life.

66
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,079
But this book put a real asterisk on that in a way that I didn't want.

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,639
And now Artifical Intelligence is on my near-term threat list in a deeply unwelcome way.

68
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,819
But it would be self-delusional to ignore a convincing argument because I don't want it to be true.

69
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,859
There's much more discussion on Hello Internet if you click here. Technoptimistis beware.

70
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,759
Question:

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,519
In my ideal life I would live in many different places for a year or two at a time, but that's not really practical now.

72
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,539
If I had to pick a new city at this very moment it would be Amsterdam.

73
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,779
Question:

74
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,179
Answered your own question there.

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,519
Question:

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,239
I don't know. The kind of automation I worry about is the same kind that creates Star Trek abundance.

77
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,799
The transition from here to there worries me and solutions that would work in this world might not work in the in between.

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,119
Also, I am open to the idea that I may be wrong about automation and many have good arguments as to why.

79
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,079
Technology decreasing jobs goes against all the data from all the history of all the world's economies.

80
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,539
But I think we'll find out sooner than most people expect.

81
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:47,219
Teslas are quasi-automated already -- and automation of transport is my prediction for the biggest, most visible impact on employment.

82
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,799
Even pizza companies are getting into the auto business!

83
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,319
Question:

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,139
Way too much Factorio.  *Way* too much.

85
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,139
Also, Rimworld.  And, much to my own surprise, American Truck Simulator: so relaxing.

86
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,059
I cannot wait for them to add the rest of the states, and Canada.  Please?

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,079
Question:

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,519
It used to look like this...

89
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,899
But, I've just set up a brand new one and it looks like this.

90
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,479
Question:

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,999
::sigh:: Yeah, maybe.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,539
Devil's in the details though. At one extreme end, if you want to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to persue a degree in something that ends in 'studies',...

93
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,239
...you'd be better off taking that money and starting a restaurant.

94
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,959
Don't get me wrong, starting a restaurant is a *terrible* idea but it's a *better* terrible idea.

95
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,559
On the other end if you live in a country that pays for college and you're getting a degree in a high-paying field, that's easy to recommend.

96
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,839
But between those extremes is where difficult decisions lie.

97
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,439
Personally, I went to college and took out  a loan and got a degree close to this end of the spectrum...

98
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,079
...but I only felt comfortable doing that because I was also getting a degree on this end of the spectrum.

99
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,839
Shock surprise: this one paid my bills and this one was a nice hobby.

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,519
Question:

101
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,119
Your life is in your hands alone now - this is the best and worst thing about adulthood.

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,739
Question:

103
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,619
Jesus Christ man, have you ever seen eye surgery?

104
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,479
You're *awake*, it's *your eyes*.  I'll consider eye surgery only when I can replace them fully.

105
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,659
Question:

106
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,099
No, obviously not.  Uh… Maybe?

107
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,979
Question:

108
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,299
It doesn't matter.  Only agreement matters.

109
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,919
Question:

110
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,819
To live abroad is to be constantly reminded of outsider status.  So I don't feel remotely British.

111
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:29,279
But having lived in the UK for the whole of my adult life, however, now when I go back to America it feels like Canada -- familiar yet foreign.

112
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,699
So I'm a bit homeless but it doesn't matter because people over-value national identities anyway.

113
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,119
In the end I feel like someone who grew up in America and is just a person in the world.

114
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,779
Question:

115
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,779
Here's a super fast way to iron you're clothes:

116
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,719
Don't bother: buy clothes that don't need ironing. I've just saved you hundreds of hours of your life. You're welcome.

117
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,599
Question:

118
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,439
I think New Year's resolutions are dumb and designed to fail.

119
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,919
I mean, how many of you have already totally abandoned your New Year's resolutions?

120
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,219
But I do like themes for the year.

121
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:10,699
This is my Year Of Less -- you'll need to go to Cortex for a full explanation -- because it's a bit complicated and not what it sounds like and I'm still kinda working on it.

122
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,499
Question:

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,839
Messy and, to the surprise of many, cursive.

124
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,779
Question:

125
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,199
Poorly.  My stress management technique is to remove the source.

126
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,199
I'd rather eliminate the problem than get better at dealing with it.

127
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,159
Question:

128
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,039
It's hard to separate my thoughts on national flags from the countries themselves.

129
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,559
Scrolling through the list I find myself drawn to the Canadian Flag, the U.K., Germany and Nordic flags...

130
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,179
...but it's because I *like* those places.

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,219
That said, I'm also always a sucker for a strong design in the center: like Barbados & Kenya.

132
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:42,179
And most national flags are pretty good, if a little safe -- they're no abomination like the state flags.

133
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,299
It's harder to pick the top out of bunch of mostly good designs as opposed to picking the best out of a pile of poo.

134
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,759
Question:

135
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,019
I didn't read as many as I would have liked but I'm going to pick "So You've Been Publically Shamed" as my book of the year.

136
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,299
If I designed a school curriculum, it would be required reading for the 'Living on The Internet' module.

137
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,999
Question:

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,499
I divide my working time into units, each unit is 40 minutes long and I spent 5 units over a couple of days looking at the most upvoted questions...

139
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,619
...and all the questions in random order and selecting the ones that interested me ...

140
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,879
...then many, many more units writing various drafts.

141
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,859
This script started at a 5,000 boring messy words and got cut to 2,000 hopefully more interesting words.

142
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,379
And thank you to everyone who submitted questions.  I'm aware that I only got to half a percent of them, so we'll have to do this again sometime.

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,739
Oh, and of course:

144
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,139
Question:

145
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:35,279
Squarespace is the easiest way to create a beautiful website, blog, or online store, for you and your ideas.
