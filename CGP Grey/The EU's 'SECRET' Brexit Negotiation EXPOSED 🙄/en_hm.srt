00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,299
Hello, I stumbled upon the EU's secret negotiation plan in the form of this slide

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,559
presented by the chief EU negotiator at the European Council.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,239
This slide is amazing and I want to talk to you about it.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,239
So, since the Brexit breakup the EU and the UK have been trying unsuccessfully to broker a deal,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,339
and this slide makes it painfully clear why that has made such little progress over such a long time.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,239
It started with brexit where the UK voted to leave the European Union;

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,659
now, what that means isn't exactly clear because the EU has a core center

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,659
but it also has many orbits of relationships.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,659
So, the EU and the UK needed to figure out where they were as a couple

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,499
and the UK has a list of deal-breakers that, at least at time of recording, are non-negotiable-

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,359
and that's fine! Everyone has relationship deal-breakers. It would be unhealthy not to.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,739
Anyway, core no more

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,299
the EU's next closest relationships are with Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,359
as part of the European Economic Area.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,419
This is a kind of "EU Light"

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,339
They're part of the unified EU economy with the EU's four freedoms:

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,239
Free movement of goods, free movement of services, free movement of capital, and free movement of people

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,239
So, as an Irish citizen, since Ireland is "Core EU",

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,379
I could go live in a cabin in Norway, even though they're not Core EU

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,519
because of the free movement of people and vice versa

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,939
Now for the UK free movement to people is a huge deal

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,259
Shut it down – deal-breaker

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,199
This makes an EEA style relationship. Just impossible

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,359
So the next relationship orbital out is Switzerland who has a unique relationship with the EU

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,139
She's not EU core,

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,899
she's also not in the EEA,

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,439
and she is completely landlocked by EU core members

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,599
(I mean except for Liechtenstein)

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,979
So perhaps inevitably despite not being part of the EU in any way

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,919
she has over a hundred bilateral treaties with the EU

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,619
integrating their economies

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,979
which means that Switzerland has given up complete regulatory autonomy on goods and services to facilitate trade

33
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,279
This is also a deal breaker.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,879
Switzerland's treaties grant freedom of movement– deal-breaker

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,279
–and Switzerland makes significant financial contributions to the EU– deal breaker.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,219
These two things are also part of the EEA

37
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,579
So while Switzerland isn't an EU member, in fact, she is

38
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,979
basically in practice, but also, like the EEA members,

39
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,299
lacks representation in the Parliament of EU Core

40
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,959
So, Switzerland's relationship with the EU is also not one that the UK wants to emulate

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,599
this now moves us to the outermost orbitals

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,459
and we get into the really deep asterisks of European Union foreign relationships

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,639
This is stuff like the European Eastern Partnership and the deep and comprehensive trade agreements

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,619
Which sounds like political dirty talk

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,599
or the European neighbourhood policy.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,639
a lot of the aims of these things is to bring neighbours more in line with Europe

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,659
either with what the EU politely calls "The Promotion of Human Rights" or trade integration

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,879
but both of these bring up the final deal breakers for the UK

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,179
taking Ukraine as an example, while not remotely in EU member or even close,

50
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,229
she has agreed to let the European Court of Justice have some jurisdictional power in her borders

51
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,159
This is required by the EU for Ukrainian participation in Interpol

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,099
A kind of FBI for the EU that works on cross-border crime. Nonetheless European Court of Justice

53
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,279
jurisdiction does mean giving up some sovereignty on some issues

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,999
and that's a deal breaker or take Turkey who can participate in trade negotiations under the aegis of the EU

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,369
Presumably to benefit from the trading power a large bloc has but this means Turkey doesn't have complete independence in matters of trade policy

56
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,689
Deal-breaker and so now we've passed the outermost orbital. Where a

57
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:48,129
relationship even means anything and so end up in an inevitable no deal with the EU and UK's relationship being just

58
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,099
regular countries to each other in the World Trade Organization

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,279
Membership of which is basically every country on Earth

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,249
So the progress from EU core out to No

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,009
Deal is what this slide is showing: why the EU

62
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:07,589
thinks that path is the only path but the UK has been saying very loudly she wants to deal while also saying brexit means brexit

63
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:15,399
She wants independence but also wants a relationship that's deeper and more comprehensive with the EU than just the cold

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,199
WTO rules, but for the EU it's

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,179
impossible to see how to satisfy those desires contradictory without triggering the UK safeword

66
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,099
Which is probably why this EU negotiation strategy slide wasn't a secret

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,639
but was published back in December of 2017

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,679
by the lead negotiator in front of the heads of state because this isn't a secret strategy

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,869
It's a clear illustration of the mechanistic results of all of the UK's deal-breakers

70
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,799
I really do think this is a pretty amazing infographic in terms of clarity for a horrifically

71
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,649
complicated topic which is why I just had to make this footnote to share it with you because

72
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,509
I could not bear to let it fade away into my notes as just part of the background reading

73
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,009
anyway

74
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:05,259
that is why the brexit timeline has been so long with so little happening the UK has mutually

75
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,729
exclusive wants as also discussed in the main video in a different area and

76
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,669
It's really all down to the UK

77
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,579
She could stick with the deal-breakers and go it alone

78
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,919
Or she can drop some and settle in an orbital relationship with the EU, but she can't have both I guess

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,619
We'll see what happens soon

80
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
maybe
