1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,408
The “Red Death” had long devastated the
country.

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:07,509
No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so
hideous.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,569
Blood was its Avatar and its seal—the redness
and the horror of blood.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,109
There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness,
and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,849
dissolution.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,159
The scarlet stains upon the body and especially
upon the face of the victim, were the pest

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,239
ban which shut him out from the aid and from
the sympathy of his fellow-men.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,809
And the whole seizure, progress and termination
of the disease, were the incidents of half

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,849
an hour.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,539
But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless
and sagacious.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,449
When his dominions were half depopulated,
he summoned to his presence a thousand hale

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,859
and light-hearted friends from among the knights
and dames of his court, and with these retired

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,169
to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated
abbeys.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,649
This was an extensive and magnificent structure,
the creation of the prince’s own eccentric

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,219
yet august taste.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,529
A strong and lofty wall girdled it in.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,259
This wall had gates of iron.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,259
The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces
and massy hammers and welded the bolts.

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,999
They resolved to leave means neither of ingress
nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,739
or of frenzy from within.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,709
The abbey was amply provisioned.

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,569
With such precautions the courtiers might
bid defiance to contagion.

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,529
The external world could take care of itself.

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,199
In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or
to think.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,079
The prince had provided all the appliances
of pleasure.

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,419
There were buffoons, there were improvisatori,
there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians,

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,459
there was Beauty, there was wine.

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,439
All these and security were within.

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,439
Without was the "Red Death".

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,798
It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth
month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,629
raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince
Prospero entertained his thousand friends

32
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,259
at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.

33
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,779
It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade.

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,569
But first let me tell of the rooms in which
it was held.

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,499
These were seven—an imperial suite.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,029
In many palaces, however, such suites form
a long and straight vista, while the folding

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,978
doors slide back nearly to the walls on either
hand, so that the view of the whole extent

38
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,868
is scarcely impeded.

39
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,168
Here the case was very different, as might
have been expected from the duke’s love

40
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,328
of the _bizarre_.

41
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:17,608
The apartments were so irregularly disposed
that the vision embraced but little more than

42
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:18,828
one at a time.

43
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:24,188
There was a sharp turn at every twenty or
thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect.

44
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,429
To the right and left, in the middle of each
wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked

45
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,568
out upon a closed corridor which pursued the
windings of the suite.

46
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,638
These windows were of stained glass whose
colour varied in accordance with the prevailing

47
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,229
hue of the decorations of the chamber into
which it opened.

48
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,429
That at the eastern extremity was hung, for
example in blue—and vividly blue were its

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,429
windows.

50
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,119
The second chamber was purple in its ornaments
and tapestries, and here the panes were purple.

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,339
The third was green throughout, and so were
the casements.

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,318
The fourth was furnished and lighted with
orange—the fifth with white—the sixth

53
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,318
with violet.

54
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,768
The seventh apartment was closely shrouded
in black velvet tapestries that hung all over

55
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:08,869
the ceiling and down the walls, falling in
heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material

56
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,869
and hue.

57
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,979
But in this chamber only, the colour of the
windows failed to correspond with the decorations.

58
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,908
The panes here were scarlet—a deep blood
colour.

59
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:23,988
Now in no one of the seven apartments was
there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion

60
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,649
of golden ornaments that lay scattered to
and fro or depended from the roof.

61
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,899
There was no light of any kind emanating from
lamp or candle within the suite of chambers.

62
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,289
But in the corridors that followed the suite,
there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy

63
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,048
tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected
its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly

64
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,498
illumined the room.

65
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:49,449
And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy
and fantastic appearances.

66
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,229
But in the western or black chamber the effect
of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark

67
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,668
hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was
ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild

68
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,759
a look upon the countenances of those who
entered, that there were few of the company

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,789
bold enough to set foot within its precincts
at all.

70
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,199
It was in this apartment, also, that there
stood against the western wall, a gigantic

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,308
clock of ebony.

72
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:18,729
Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull,
heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand

73
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,449
made the circuit of the face, and the hour
was to be stricken, there came from the brazen

74
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,379
lungs of the clock a sound which was clear
and loud and deep and exceedingly musical,

75
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,869
but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that,
at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of

76
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,719
the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily,
in their performance, to harken to the sound;

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,899
and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their
evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert

78
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,869
of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes
of the clock yet rang, it was observed that

79
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,679
the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged
and sedate passed their hands over their brows

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,679
as if in confused reverie or meditation.

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,039
But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light
laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,099
musicians looked at each other and smiled
as if at their own nervousness and folly,

83
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,189
and made whispering vows, each to the other,
that the next chiming of the clock should

84
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,279
produce in them no similar emotion; and then,
after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace

85
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,459
three thousand and six hundred seconds of
the Time that flies,) there came yet another

86
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,789
chiming of the clock, and then were the same
disconcert and tremulousness and meditation

87
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,799
as before.

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,499
But, in spite of these things, it was a gay
and magnificent revel.

89
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,699
The tastes of the duke were peculiar.

90
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,029
He had a fine eye for colours and effects.

91
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,839
He disregarded the _decora_ of mere fashion.

92
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,299
His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions
glowed with barbaric lustre.

93
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,519
There are some who would have thought him
mad.

94
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,709
His followers felt that he was not.

95
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,689
It was necessary to hear and see and touch
him to be _sure_ that he was not.

96
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,419
He had directed, in great part, the movable
embellishments of the seven chambers, upon

97
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,069
occasion of this great _fête_; and it was
his own guiding taste which had given character

98
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,669
to the masqueraders.

99
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,049
Be sure they were grotesque.

100
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,439
There were much glare and glitter and piquancy
and phantasm.

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,289
There were arabesque figures with unsuited
limbs and appointments.

102
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,539
There were delirious fancies such as the madman
fashions.

103
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,609
There were much of the beautiful, much of
the wanton, much of the _bizarre_, something

104
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,959
of the terrible, and not a little of that
which might have excited disgust.

105
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,329
To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked,
in fact, a multitude of dreams.

106
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,119
And these—the dreams—writhed in and about
taking hue from the rooms, and causing the

107
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,939
wild music of the orchestra to seem as the
echo of their steps.

108
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,649
And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which
stands in the hall of the velvet.

109
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,109
And then, for a moment, all is still, and
all is silent save the voice of the clock.

110
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,269
The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand.

111
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,269
But the echoes of the chime die away—they
have endured but an instant—and a light,

112
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,299
half-subdued laughter floats after them as
they depart.

113
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,339
And now again the music swells, and the dreams
live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than

114
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,359
ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows
through which stream the rays from the tripods.

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,979
But to the chamber which lies most westwardly
of the seven, there are now none of the maskers

116
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,969
who venture; for the night is waning away;
and there flows a ruddier light through the

117
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,959
blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of
the sable drapery appals; and to him whose

118
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,199
foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes
from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,289
more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches
_their_ ears who indulged in the more remote

120
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,719
gaieties of the other apartments.

121
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,189
But these other apartments were densely crowded,
and in them beat feverishly the heart of life.

122
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,659
And the revel went whirlingly on, until at
length there commenced the sounding of midnight

123
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,079
upon the clock.

124
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,119
And then the music ceased, as I have told;
and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted;

125
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,729
and there was an uneasy cessation of all things
as before.

126
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,199
But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded
by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened,

127
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,959
perhaps, that more of thought crept, with
more of time, into the meditations of the

128
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,079
thoughtful among those who revelled.

129
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,699
And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before
the last echoes of the last chime had utterly

130
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,638
sunk into silence, there were many individuals
in the crowd who had found leisure to become

131
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,109
aware of the presence of a masked figure which
had arrested the attention of no single individual

132
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,299
before.

133
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,879
And the rumour of this new presence having
spread itself whisperingly around, there arose

134
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,989
at length from the whole company a buzz, or
murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise—then,

135
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,658
finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.

136
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,718
In an assembly of phantasms such as I have
painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary

137
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,708
appearance could have excited such sensation.

138
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:52,148
In truth the masquerade licence of the night
was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question

139
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:58,628
had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the
bounds of even the prince’s indefinite decorum.

140
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:04,078
There are chords in the hearts of the most
reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.

141
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:09,198
Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and
death are equally jests, there are matters

142
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,768
of which no jest can be made.

143
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:16,449
The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply
to feel that in the costume and bearing of

144
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,698
the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed.

145
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:24,578
The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded
from head to foot in the habiliments of the

146
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:25,578
grave.

147
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:29,588
The mask which concealed the visage was made
so nearly to resemble the countenance of a

148
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:34,088
stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny
must have had difficulty in detecting the

149
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,088
cheat.

150
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:41,648
And yet all this might have been endured,
if not approved, by the mad revellers around.

151
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,299
But the mummer had gone so far as to assume
the type of the Red Death.

152
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,088
His vesture was dabbled in _blood_—and his
broad brow, with all the features of the face,

153
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,109
was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.

154
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,328
When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell
upon this spectral image (which, with a slow

155
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:05,148
and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain
its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers)

156
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:09,778
he was seen to be convulsed, in the first
moment with a strong shudder either of terror

157
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,479
or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened
with rage.

158
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,039
“Who dares,”—he demanded hoarsely of
the courtiers who stood near him—“who

159
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,308
dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery?

160
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:27,208
Seize him and unmask him—that we may know
whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the

161
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,368
battlements!”

162
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:32,989
It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which
stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these

163
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,989
words.

164
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,768
They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly
and clearly, for the prince was a bold and

165
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,638
robust man, and the music had become hushed
at the waving of his hand.

166
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,148
It was in the blue room where stood the prince,
with a group of pale courtiers by his side.

167
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,708
At first, as he spoke, there was a slight
rushing movement of this group in the direction

168
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:57,338
of the intruder, who at the moment was also
near at hand, and now, with deliberate and

169
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:00,599
stately step, made closer approach to the
speaker.

170
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,919
But from a certain nameless awe with which
the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired

171
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,388
the whole party, there were found none who
put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded,

172
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:14,818
he passed within a yard of the prince’s
person; and, while the vast assembly, as if

173
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:19,919
with one impulse, shrank from the centres
of the rooms to the walls, he made his way

174
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,789
uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn
and measured step which had distinguished

175
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,349
him from the first, through the blue chamber
to the purple—through the purple to the

176
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,588
green—through the green to the orange—through
this again to the white—and even thence

177
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,949
to the violet, ere a decided movement had
been made to arrest him.

178
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,429
It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,
maddening with rage and the shame of his own

179
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,409
momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through
the six chambers, while none followed him

180
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,778
on account of a deadly terror that had seized
upon all.

181
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:55,849
He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached,
in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four

182
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,268
feet of the retreating figure, when the latter,
having attained the extremity of the velvet

183
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,268
apartment, turned suddenly and confronted
his pursuer.

184
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:09,118
There was a sharp cry—and the dagger dropped
gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which,

185
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:13,008
instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death
the Prince Prospero.

186
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:17,878
Then, summoning the wild courage of despair,
a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves

187
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,559
into the black apartment, and, seizing the
mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and

188
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,638
motionless within the shadow of the ebony
clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding

189
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:33,088
the grave cerements and corpse-like mask,
which they handled with so violent a rudeness,

190
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:36,148
untenanted by any tangible form.

191
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,558
And now was acknowledged the presence of the
Red Death.

192
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,498
He had come like a thief in the night.

193
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:45,809
And one by one dropped the revellers in the
blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died

194
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,909
each in the despairing posture of his fall.

195
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,719
And the life of the ebony clock went out with
that of the last of the gay.

196
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,338
And the flames of the tripods expired.

197
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,640
And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held
illimitable dominion over all.
