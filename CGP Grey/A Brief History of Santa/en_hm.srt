1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,829
On the 24th of December every year children
around the world put out milk and cookies

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,068
in the hopes of luring a magic fat man into
their home who will leave presents behind

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,149
before sneaking into the house next door.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,878
How did such an odd tradition begin?

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,359
You can pretty much blame Northern Europe,
where the winter weather is cold and dark

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,359
and depressing.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,179
And the coldest and darkest and depressingest
day is the Solstice on December 21st or 22nd

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,089
when the sun only gives a few hours of weak
light if any at all.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,589
These sun-deprived people invented magical
characters to visit them and lighten the mood

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,609
by bringing gifts and celebrations.

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,829
These characters ranged from elves to Gods
to goats, but there are two of particular

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,429
interest to the modern story.

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,129
The first is St Nick, in The Netherlands.

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,819
St Nick is thin and perhaps a bit stern, but
still brings presents to children early in

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,819
December.

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,009
He dresses like a bishop in red and white
with a staff and rides on a horse named Amerigo,

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,579
for whom Dutch children are encouraged to
leave out a carrot.

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,869
St Nick is called Sinterklaas in Dutch.

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,089
The second character is Father Christmas from
England.

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,679
Father Christmas is a big, jolly pagan dressed
in green with a holly wreath on his head.

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,190
Traditionally he is less concerned with children
and gifts than he is with food and wine and

22
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,339
celebration and is perhaps best known for
being one of the three spirits of Christmas

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,139
who terrorize Scrooge.

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,279
When Europeans settled the Colonies St Nick
and Father Christmas and the other characters

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,029
began to mix together.

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,889
This explains why the US version has so many
names.

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,069
Santa Claus is the Americanization of Sinterklaas,
but he's also called St Nick and Father Christmas

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,069
and Kris Kringle which comes from Germany.

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,569
In the old world these were different characters,
but in the new world over time they evolved

30
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,559
into one which you can see happening in older
stories.

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,779
For example, the poem, "The Night Before Christmas"
came out in 1823 in New York which established

32
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,459
that Santa lands on the roof and fills stocking
with toys.

33
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,689
But this Santa is an elf, much like those
from the Nordic Countries.

34
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,929
He's very small and drives a miniature sleigh
with tiny reindeer -- which makes a lot more

35
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,819
sense for someone whose job description includes
fitting down chimneys.

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,499
Also, the word, 'Santa' appears nowhere in
the poem.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,149
The original title is 'A visit from St Nick'.

38
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,149
As the 1800s continued a fat, human looking
immortal Santa evolved into the standard among

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,149
American authors.

40
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,809
It was in the states that he gained both his
elvish workforce and a wife.

41
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,189
By about 1900 Santa had developed his current
iconic style.

42
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,009
It should be noted that, contrary to popular
belief, Coca-Cola didn't change his colors

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,298
to their corporate scheme but instead used
the conveniently red-and-white Santa in 1931

44
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,368
to help sell more soda during their off season.

45
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,339
Though Coke didn't create him their omni-present
ads probably did brand this as the One True

46
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,738
Santa in the minds of millions helping spread
him round the world to many cultures with

47
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,738
no traditions of winter gift-givers.

48
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,149
This American Santa in-turn influenced his
relations in Northern Europe to become more

49
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,579
like him, although not always to the pleasure
of the locals.

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,119
In particular, the British Father Christmas
has been completely assimilated into the Santa

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,598
collective to the point where many Britons
don't realize they were ever separate.

52
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,209
In the Netherlands, however, St Nick is still
successfully holding his own as a distinct

53
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,209
character.

54
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,539
The one last detail about modern Santa that's
still up for debate, at least between countries,

55
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,829
is where exactly he lives.

56
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,629
In the late 1800s his home was the magnetic
north pole centered under the aurora borealis.

57
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,309
While this would be the most diplomatic option
for Santa Magnetic North has since moved off

58
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,339
the Polar Ice Sheet and into the Ocean, a
rather inconvenient place to set up a toy

59
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,339
factory.

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,089
So Canada claims his workshop is somewhere
in Nunavut and has given Santa a post code

61
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,818
and -- no joke -- official Canadian citizenship.

62
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,229
The American response is that the North Pole
doesn't refer to the obviously inhospitable

63
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,229
sheet of non-domestic ice but rather to the
little town of North Pole, Alaska.

64
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,619
Denmark claims he lives in their former colony
of Greenland.

65
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,509
And Greenland, not surprisingly, agrees.

66
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,980
The Nordic countries quarrel about his exact
location but Finland is the clear winner of

67
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:17,119
this argument with his workshop in Rovaniemi
on the Arctic Circle.

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,499
For the evidence inclined, you can actually
go visit Santa there and see the elves, toys,

69
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,449
reindeer and post office, which makes Finland's
claim pretty strong.

70
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,409
Santa is even available during the off season.

71
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,239
But, no matter where he might be based, Santa
still manages to get round the world in just

72
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:51,540
one night to deliver all those presents...
and eat all those cookies.
