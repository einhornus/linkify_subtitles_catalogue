1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,879
One of the simplest

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,239
if not the best ways to do a proportional system

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,539
is to have voters simply put an "X" next to their favorite party

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,019
and then you take those results from the citizens' votes

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,159
and you try to match your representatives to that as closely as possible

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,879
given the number of seats that you have in your legislative branch.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,259
But, one of the philosophical problems that you might have with such a system

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,239
is that the citizens aren't voting for individuals in particular,

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,379
they're voting for the party in general.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,419
And what that means is there needs to be a meeting that happens somewhere

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,119
at the party headquarters where they determine who their favorite candidates are.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,979
And so when the monkey party gets told that they have three seats

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,899
they have already made a list of who gets the first seat, the second seat, and the third seat.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,539
Proportional systems do have the advantage that their explicit goal is to try to match

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,839
the legislative branch of the government as closely as possible to how the citizens have voted.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,179
STV is a bit of a proportional"ish" system.

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,679
Proportionality is not its goal; its goal is actually trying to make sure that

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,759
as many citizens as possible have local representatives that they voted for

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,159
and also to minimize the number of unhappy voters.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,900
And as a side effect you get a roughly proportional legislature, but not exactly.
