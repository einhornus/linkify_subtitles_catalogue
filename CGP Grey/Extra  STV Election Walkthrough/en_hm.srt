00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,619
In the main video, I went through a couple of quick little examples of STV elections,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,779
but in this extra video, I want to take a bigger election and go through it in a little bit more depth

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,479
so that you can see how an STV election unfolds.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,619
In this case we are going to have 10 candidates, and there are going to be five seats for representative open.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,559
So that means each candidate needs to get 20% to win.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,919
So citizens go off to the polls and their first choice results come in as follows:

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,559
Tarsier gets 5%

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,079
Gorilla gets 32%

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,599
Silverback gets 3%

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,179
Owl gets 33%

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,359
Turtle gets 1%

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,359
Snake gets 1%

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,559
Tiger gets 16%

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,779
Lynx gets 4%

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,079
Jackelope gets 2%

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,739
and Buffalo gets 3%.

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,399
Now what we can see here is a situation that is very often the case in real elections with STV

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,099
That there are two or three parties with a lot of support

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,519
--in this case Gorilla, Owl, and Tiger--

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,739
and there are a bunch of parties that have less than 5% of the vote.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,199
So let's see how this works out.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,419
First, Gorilla and Owl get awarded a seat because they have both crossed the threshold required to win.

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,079
Both candidates have more votes than they actually needed to get in,

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,519
which means they have more support among the population than just their one candidate can provide.

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,079
You take a look at which candidate has the biggest surplus votes first and redistribute those.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,279
Owl has 32%, she has the biggest surplus. Her voters' second choice is the most important thing to figure out

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,539
and in this case it is Turtle.

28
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,359
Next up, Gorilla has a surplus of votes.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,599
Now, up until this point we've been pretending that all citizens in the animal kingdom vote in exactly the same way.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,579
But in real elections, voters don't all agree on what their second choice is.

31
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,239
So Gorilla voters, it turns out, are split between Tarsier and Silverback for their second choice.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,299
There are very many ways to try to resolve this situation of what happens when second choice votes are split.

33
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,279
But to simplify a little bit, we can just say that those votes are distributed proportionally.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,479
So in this case, 2-to-1 voters like Silverback over Tarsier as their second choice.

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,899
So that is how the votes get distributed, bumping Silverback up to 11% and Tarsier up to 9%.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,219
At this point, nobody has a surplus of votes anymore and nobody's over the threshold, so we start eliminating the biggest loser first.

37
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:18,479
In this case, that is Snake. Snake was never going to win and so those votes go to Snake voters' second choice which is Turtle.

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,039
Next up, Jackelope is the biggest loser.

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,459
Now, what happens here is Jackelope voters only like Jackelope.

40
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,519
They don't like any other candidate. They think everybody else is equally bad and only Jackelope is awesome.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,379
So they just put a one next to Jackelope on their voting ballot,

42
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,719
and nothing next to anybody else.

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,019
What happens in this situation is Jackelope votes are actually just removed from the election at this stage.

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,739
Their voters have said that they don't care if Jackelope doesn't win.

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,839
So it's almost like they didn't vote.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,479
Next up, Buffalo is eliminated.

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,019
Now, his voters put Jackelope as second choice, but since Jackelope has been already eliminated,

48
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,239
his votes can't go there.

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,979
In STV it does matter that you're able to get a certain number of peoples' first choice vote.

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,539
Sometimes people criticize the system for that, but I don't think it's unreasonable

51
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,239
to consider that first choice votes matter more than other votes.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,439
Since Buffalo voters can't move to their second choice 2/3rds of Buffalo voters don't care at this point

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,519
they wanted Buffalo or Jackelope and they don't like anybody else,

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,279
and 1/3rd of Buffalo voters back Turtle.

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,759
So Turtle has gotten another little slice of 1% bringing him up to 16% and tied with Tiger.

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,319
But, the next biggest loser is Lynx.

57
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,679
Lynx votes go to Tiger, and Tiger is selected as the next representative for reaching the voting threshold.

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,539
Next biggest loser is Tasier. Sorry Tarsier.

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,479
Tarsier at this stage has votes both from citizens who selected her as their first choice

60
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,459
and candidates who selected her as their second choice after Gorilla.

61
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,959
So when these votes are redistributed, some of them are going to their second choice

62
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,299
and some of them are going to their third choice.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,559
But simians stick together, and so towards Silverback is where they go.

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,839
Silverback is elected as the next representative.

65
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,999
Finally, the question is what to do with Turtle.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,819
Turtle is the next biggest loser and hasn't reached the threshold

67
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,499
but there are five seats open in this election.

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,559
The rule under most STV systems is that if you have one seat open, and you have one candidate remaining,

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,159
even if they didn't quite reach the threshold, they still get in.

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,619
And so Turtle is elected as our final representative.

71
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,699
If we jump back to the beginning, we can see that this has turned out to be a pretty good result.

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,679
Our biggest sections of the population were Gorilla and Owl

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,679
and they ended up getting both their first and second choices.

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,339
Tiger and Lynx were the next biggest sections of the population.

75
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,659
They got one of their choices.

76
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,799
A lot of parties agreed that they were OK with Turtle as their next choice,

77
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,639
and those votes prevented Turtle from getting eliminated in any particular round.

78
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
And so Turtle, too, is a representative.
