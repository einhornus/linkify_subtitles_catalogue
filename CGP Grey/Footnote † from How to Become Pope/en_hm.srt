00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,079
Remember in the first footnote how I said there are 23 Catholic churches within the Catholic Church, *all* with different traditions?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,399
This is one of the times that matters. Only the Latin Church, the largest of the 23, requires priests to be celibate.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,339
The other 22 Catholic Churches known as the Eastern Churches allow married men to become priests, but not to advance any more.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,739
But even this is a bit of an oversimplification, because priests in the Latin Church *can* be married under certain circumstances;

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,319
most notably, former Anglican priests who *were* married at the time of their conversion to Catholicism are not required to relinquish their wives.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,860
But as with the Eastern churches their marriage prevents them from rising any higher.
