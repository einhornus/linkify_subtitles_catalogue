Hello Internet,

2
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:05,789
I want to talk about Canada who this week
made my reason-to-like her list one item longer

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,679
by deciding to abolish the penny.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,888
Since I previously made a video called 'Death
to Pennies' it should come as no surprise

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,848
that this move gets a big 'Go Canada!'

6
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,848
from me.

7
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,049
So lets take a moment to cheer Canada for
her economic rationalism, look at how getting

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,509
rid of a coin works in practice, and remind
her sister to the South why she might want

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,118
to do the same.

10
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,258
Canada's plan is pretty simple: in a couple
months the Royal Canadian Mint will switch

11
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,998
the penny making machine from on, to off.

12
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:28,998
That's it.

13
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:31,049
Pretty much nothing else in the world is going
to change.

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,939
Pennies will still be be legal tender in Canada,
so that jar of several hundred that you'll

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,409
never bother to count will always be worth
just as much as it is today.

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,499
And In shops there will still be that person
who pays with exact change.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,249
But after they've tediously counted out their
precious (worthless) pennies the shop will

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,099
send them to back to the Royal Canadian Mint
to be melted down.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,709
Thus the supply of pennies will slowly decrease
over time in pleasant half-life curve.

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,389
But, while the penny will functionally go
away, prices listed in one-cent intervals

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,389
will not.

22
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,209
Your coffee and TimBits will still cost the
same and when you get to the cash register

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,029
the total amount after tax will still have
single cents.

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,899
And if you pay by card, that exact amount
will be deducted from your account.

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,109
The only difference is if you pay in cash,
not card, *and* you don't have any pennies

26
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,789
with which to waste everyone else's time then
the price will be rounded to the nearest five

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,789
cents.

28
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,279
And yes, in rounding sometimes you win and
sometimes you lose but -- and this is the

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,139
rather salient point -- either way a one or
two cent difference isn't worth caring about.

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,029
Which is why Canada can safely jettison the
penny in the first place.

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,389
Inevitably, thought, this is the point in
the discussion when pro-penny people propose

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,158
that ditching the worthless coin will make
prices go up and your savings go down.

33
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,629
But the evidence for this claim is nonexistent
because many countries have done this before

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,728
with no ill effect.

35
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,099
Sure, coin collectors and inefficiency fans
will be sad to see the penny go but overall

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,158
it's a big win for Canada because printing
money isn't free.

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,259
The cost to make a one-cent penny is 1.6 cents.

38
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,978
So every year when Canada visited the mint
she spent 29 million dollars to buy 18 million

39
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,209
dollars worth of pennies -- effectively throwing
away 11 million dollars a year.

40
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,298
Now, obviously ditching pennies won't single-handedly
balance the budget but it's the easiest most

41
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,978
rational place to start.

42
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,169
Congratulations Canada!

43
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,879
May others follow in your path.

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,879
P.S.

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,148
If you want to know more about why the United
States in particular should get rid of pennies

46
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,878
you can either watch my video on the topic
or listen to fellow penny-hater John Green

47
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,799
get arm-wavingly angry about not only pennies,
but also nickels, which are even worse.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,638
Also There should be a new main video up in
the next week or two but if you want to help

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,839
me make them faster you go here on my website
to help out with the fact-checking for upcoming

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,839
projects.

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,159
Thanks for watching.
