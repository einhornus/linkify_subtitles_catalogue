1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,796
The United States is, shockingly, a bunch of states that are united.

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,220
It was just 13 to start with,

3
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:07,244
but as time marched on, the border marked west,

4
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:11,268
bringing us to today and the 48 contiguous states
plus Alaska and Hawaii.

5
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,092
They're usually drawn in these little boxes,
not to to scale because Hawaii is in the middle of a

6
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:18,616
vast ocean of deadly nothing-ness, 
and Alaska is monstrous.

7
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:22,190
Unlike other unions, where members can leave
if they so choose,

8
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:24,214
statehood is eternal.

9
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:25,538
Even for you, Texas.

10
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,962
Now, how the federal government works 
is a story for another time,

11
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:32,086
but at the moment, all you need know is that
Congress, where national laws are written

12
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:34,810
is made of representatives who are sent 
from the states.

13
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:38,334
Now, there are some non-state gaps not
visible on this map.

14
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:41,558
The first is Washington D.C.,
the nation's capital.

15
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,877
which is a stateless limbo land
between Maryland and Virginia.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,796
As D.C. is a city without a state,
it puts her under the control of Congress.

17
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:54,820
Meaning all the other states get the final
say on how D.C. is run,

18
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,844
while she doesn't get a vote in anything.

19
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:59,863
It didn't matter when the District of Columbia
was basically uninhabited,

20
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:03,387
but since more people live in D.C. now
than do in a couple of states

21
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,411
it's an uncomfortable arrangement.

22
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:08,435
The other gaps on this map are the 
American Indian reservations.

23
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,459
which are numerous.

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,083
The United States kind of administers them
while sort of  treating them as foreign nations

25
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:17,807
which means you could draw the state
boundaries to look like this

26
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:21,431
because the reservations are kind of
apart from those states.

27
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:24,955
But the American Indian reservations
are such a full of asterisks

28
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:26,579
(O' so sensitive situation)

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,903
it's also better as a story for
another time.

30
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:32,627
Gaps aside, the continent (and Hawaii) is
mostly straight-forward.

31
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:36,151
But there's more than just these
United States.

32
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:38,975
When the U.S. ran out of lands 
to manifest destiny,

33
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:42,299
she learned from the best
and teritorified a whole bunch of islands.

34
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,323
First up: Puerto Rico - 
an organized, unincorporated territory

35
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:48,047
of the U.S.
This means she's self-governing(to some extent)

36
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:52,071
and that all the U.S. constitution doesn't 
automatically apply

37
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:55,895
on the island.
Now, 3.7 million people live in Puerto Rico

38
00:01:55,896 --> 00:02:00,129
which is 91% of the people living
on U.S. Territorial islands

39
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,253
and more people than live in
21 of the states.

40
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:08,876
And, the U.S. treats Puerto Rico
as a state in almost all but name

41
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:11,001
which possibly soon
she will be anyway

42
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:14,590
bringing the number of stars to a 
nice, even, 51?

43
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:18,114
But Puerto Rico isn't the only
organized, unincorporated territory.

44
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:21,038
There's also Guam, which was acquired
in the Spanish-American war,

45
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,062
along with Puerto Rico, there's 
the Northern Mariana Islands,

46
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:26,086
taken from Japan during World War II,

47
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:28,710
and the U.S. Virgin Islands taken from
nobody -- Denmark sold her.

48
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:31,734
The people in these territories are 
American citizens.

49
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,858
In most ways, the territories are
just like D.C.

50
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,882
Congress can override their
local governments and they don't have

51
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:40,606
representation because no state-tation.

52
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,630
But otherwise, it's America.

53
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:45,854
Actually, the territories and D.C. do 
get to elect congressional representatives

54
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,678
who attend all of the meetings

55
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,702
but just can't vote in any of them.

56
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:53,326
which is either the worst job in the world
or the best job in the world

57
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,350
depending on the kind of person who gets it.

58
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:59,074
Also, since votes for president are based
on state population,

59
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,098
citizens in the territories can't vote.

60
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,622
Which as mentioned in a previous video
leads to the weird situation that

61
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:08,146
Americans who live in foreign countries
can vote for president in the

62
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,170
state where they last lived.

63
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:12,994
While Americans who live in America,
just in a territory,

64
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:13,918
cannot.

65
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,442
Along with these unincorporated organized
territories

66
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:19,576
there are also unincorporated unorganized
territories.

67
00:03:19,577 --> 00:03:21,400
Actually, quite a few.

68
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,224
They are Howland Island,
Navassa Island,

69
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:24,648
Wake Island, Jarvis Island,

70
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:26,672
Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef,
Midway Reef,

71
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,496
Serranilla Bank and Bajo Nuevo Bank.

72
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:31,920
Most of these were acquired under the 
delightfully named Guano Islands Act

73
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:35,644
when the U.S. decided she wanted
a bunch of islands filled with bird poop.

74
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:39,468
No, really, the U.S. just straight up
wrote a law to declare those islands

75
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,792
were now hers.

76
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:44,411
Unorganized, in this system, means there's
no local government on these islands

77
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:46,835
because no one lives in these places.

78
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:49,559
Some of them are barley above the water line.

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,883
Now, the weird category is unorganized 
incorporated territories

80
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:55,507
of which there is one: the Palmyra Atoll.

81
00:03:55,508 --> 00:04:00,131
claimed by the U.S. after the totally
peaceful annexation of Hawaii.

82
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:03,255
They're currently an uninhabited 
nature reserve.

83
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:06,479
But, incorporated means the U.S.
constitution applies here.

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,953
To who? The Palmyra Atoll is like that 
question about a tree falling in the forest.

85
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:14,377
If there are no people for the constitution
to apply to,

86
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:16,201
does the constitution still apply?

87
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:16,624
Yes.

88
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,049
This means if a foreigner gives birth
on this uninhabited strip

89
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,973
and doesn't die from the nature,

90
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:23,997
their child would be an American citizen.

91
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:26,021
Now, this category is empty.

92
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,345
It's where territories go
before they become states.

93
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:30,369
When basically the Constitution fully
applies

94
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,893
and it was last occupied by Hawaii.

95
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:36,117
We've gone full circle but there is
one territory we've left out --

96
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:40,241
American Samoa: home to 55,000 people.

97
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,865
Uniquely, American Samoans 
don't get to be citizens

98
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,889
but instead are American Nationals.

99
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,113
They can live in the states but can't vote
in presidential elections

100
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:51,637
Unless they go through the immigration
process like any foreigner.

101
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:55,761
Even though in all other ways,
they're indistinguishable from citizens.

102
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,285
This is unique to American Samoa
and there seems to be no reason for it

103
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:03,409
other than that Congress has
gotten around to updating the system.

104
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,333
American Samoa is in the 
no-government category, like it's lord of the flies

105
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,357
over there, which it obviously isn't.

106
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:13,381
So American Samoa with it's organized 
government needs to go over here and

107
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:16,505
Puerto Rico, essentially a state, 
needs to go over here

108
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:19,329
and the empty Palmyra Atoll needs to go
over here.

109
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,953
But, don't hold your breath for the
paperwork to make it's way through Congress

110
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,677
any time soon.

111
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:26,701
So, that's all the territories of the 
United States, but there is one final

112
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,625
thing to talk about: three tiny nations --
Palu, the Marshall Islands and the

113
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:32,649
Federated States of Micronesia.

114
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,273
The last has a convenient domain name: .fm --
first choice of quality podcasts everywhere.

115
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:38,397
*hint, hint; click, click*

116
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:40,421
These are separate countries
with UN seats and everything

117
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:43,445
but they have a 
"Compact of Free Association"

118
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:45,069
with the United States.

119
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,493
The deal is that the U.S. provide economic
support and military defense to the

120
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:53,517
compact nations in return for being allowed
to build military bases there.

121
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:57,541
Also, compact citizens can live and work
in the United States and vice versa.

122
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,865
The Americans wanting to live abroad:
you have three easy options.

123
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:04,489
So, that's America: 50 states,
many reservations, one district,

124
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,890
lots of islands territories, some even 
with people and three tiny associated countries.
