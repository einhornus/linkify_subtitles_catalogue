If I’ve learned anything about the way these places work,

160
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,879
this staircase should take me …

161
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,159
to a hole, where that top part was.

162
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,679
[with a sigh]
Yeah.  If it was under there.

163
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,569
It’s got to go up into this building.

Oooh.  There’s a storm coming in.
[eagle screech]

[slow footsteps]

169
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,519
Because this one’s locked, I want to get in the most.

Oh, sweet.

There’s also these little windows to look in.

183
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,919
So these three holes must match the three holes on the outside...

184
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,659
Alright, these three holes on the outside…

185
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,929
So what does that mean though?

186
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,399
Like.

187
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,609
So if I stand here, and turn right around.

188
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,609
I’m looking at that building.

189
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,919
I guess that thing must move off to the side?

190
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,559
I have to figure out how this actually works.

191
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,929
Ok, we’re really almost out of daylight.

192
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,769
[with a sigh]
Time to go.

193
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:20,249
[wind blowing, increasingly louder]

194
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,119
Ooph.  Didn’t quite make it out before the storm.

195
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:32,249
[wind blowing]

196
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,999
It’s a little much tumbleweed.

197
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,449
Take it down a notch.

198
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,239
[wind blowing]

199
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,729
Ahhhh.  Huahhh.

200
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:58,569
[wind blowing, increasingly louder]

201
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:04,108
[Tesla safety noise]
ding, ding, ding

202
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,739
[gate closing]
clank

203
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,139
[lock locking]
click

204
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,269
[wind blowing loudly]

205
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:22,990
[crickets chirping]
