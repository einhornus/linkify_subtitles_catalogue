1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,669
Scan-duh-nay-vee-ah!

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,529
Look at this Arctic wonderland -- fjords,
saunas, fjords, lutefisk, blondes, vikings,

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:12,268
blond vikings?, fjords, Ikea, babies in government
issued boxes, Santa, death metal, and fjords.

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,339
But like, where exactly are the borders of
Scandinavia -- because not off of this stuff

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,589
is in it.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,179
Scandinavia is just three countries exactly:
Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,598
Three kingdoms to be more precise, all of
which are on the Scandinavian peninsula -- well,

8
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,989
except Denmark, and errrr plus Finland.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,627
Wait, this doesn't help at all.

10
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:33,628
Forget that.

11
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:37,119
The three countries on this peninsula can
be collectively called Fennoscandia -- but

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,249
if you do everyone will look at you weird
because no one except the nerdiest of geography

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,159
nerds uses that word.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,159
*Fennoscandia*.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,898
So, Scandinavia is a term that's one part
geography, one part history, and one part

16
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,578
linguistics -- which is why people will argue
about who exactly is included.

17
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,599
Finland is normally excluded because she used
to be considered one of the Baltic sisters

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,729
with historical ties to mother Russia.

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,687
And Denmark, though on the other side of the
sea is included because of her relationship

20
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,349
'it's complicated' with Sweden.

21
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,889
They've had something like 15 to 21 wars between
them depending on how you want to count it.

22
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,329
And it's complicated-er because they mostly
fought over Norway.

23
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,439
And who wouldn't?

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,339
She beautiful -- and rich.

25
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,499
Anyway, when outsiders say Scandinavia they
probably mean The Nordic Countries.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,039
That's these three *plus* Finland *and* Iceland.

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,829
Though you can hardly blame people for confusion
when organizations like the American Scandinavia

28
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,329
Foundation lists everyone as members.

29
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,049
And all the Nordic Countries sometimes advertise
abroad under the banner of Scandinavia anyway.

30
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,519
This is the 'Holland' approach to international
relations: if there is a fun name that everyone

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,989
likes and keeps using wrongly, just go with
it.

32
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,779
The Nordic countries get along well enough
that they've made an official union: The Nordic

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,859
Council, a Viking cool kids club, that other
Northern European places occasionally unrealistically

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,949
dream of joining.

35
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,089
Though the Baltic sisters do get to sit with
them, but not actually vote on anything.

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,039
The Nordic Council is largely a collection
of committees that tries to get its members

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,819
to cooperate on common problems like the Arctic
environment and social welfare, and business

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,819
in the region.

39
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,609
And also finds time to make a surprisingly
long and hilariously specific list rules for

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,439
how their logo can be used.

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,069
Including a 'respect distance' the sovereignty
of which must not be violated.

42
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,919
But the biggest deal of the Nordic Council
is that citizens of these five countries get

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,259
to live and work in any of the others.

44
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,039
(Which, if you've seen the EU video -- adds
yet another semi-overlapping bubble of complexity

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,389
to an already complex region)

46
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,079
The immigration rule, however, doesn't apply
to Icelandic horses which are

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,079
1.

48
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,079
Super adorables

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,079
And 2.

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,249
Banished from returning to Iceland should
they ever leave.

51
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,069
But that's a story for another time.

52
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,259
Now, it wouldn't be a political union in Europe
without some special territorial weirdness

53
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,378
to mention, mainly:

54
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,199
- Aland: an autonomous region of Finland,
that speaks Swedish.

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,869
- And The Faeroe Islands and Greenland, both
countries in the Kingdom of Denmark.

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,419
Greenland is really the odd girl out in the
Nordic club, given that she's in the wrong

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,229
hemisphere and that Greenlanders aren't historically
or linguistically related to Nords.

58
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,999
Also, her flag ruins the otherwise consistent
design motif.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,249
But she's part of Denmark because Vikings.

60
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,259
Lastly there's Svalbard, an unincorporated
territory of Norway, that must be mentioned

61
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,849
because it has prepared for the apocalypse
with a seed bank of every plant to rebuild

62
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,219
all of agriculture should it be necessary.

63
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,859
And it's also guarded by armored bears.

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,469
So that's that -- next time you say Scandinavia,
and you're not 100% sure who that includes,

65
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,649
just say the The Nordic Countries instead.

66
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,839
Hello Internet, this is my first sponsored
video and that sponsor *is* Squarespace.

67
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,699
Squarespace is the easiest way to create a
beautiful website, blog, or online store for

68
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,949
you and your ideas.

69
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,519
I'm very happy to have them as a sponsor because
I personally use Squarespace to run cgpgrey.com

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,019
and also hellointernet.com, the podcast I
do with Brady.

71
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,829
If you are looking to have your own website
for just about anything, I personally recommend

72
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,909
Squarespace.

73
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,339

75
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,139
give them a try.

It helps Squarespace, and it helps this channel.

77
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:31,419
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

78
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:49,409
Oh how will I spend all my money?

Teslas for everyone!
