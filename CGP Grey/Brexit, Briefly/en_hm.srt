1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,379
Brexit!
The British exit from the European Union.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,399
It's a thing that's happening – or maybe not.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,999
Or maybe the United Kingdom is falling apart.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,379
There's a lot going on, so let's talk about Brexit, briefly.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,499
First: How'd we get here?

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,799
In the UK, voters for UKIP—the UK Independence Party—
grew in number over the last few elections.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,479
Now, because the United Kingdom uses a terrible
first-past-the-post voting system,

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,719
UKIP, rather than getting a proportional
number of seats in Parliament,

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,679
largely drained votes from the Conservative Party.

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,839
So, in the 2015 election, Conservatives promised to hold
an in-or-out referendum on the EU if they won,

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,119
presumably to try and sway UKIP voters to their side.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,739
The Conservatives did win, in what was, by the way,
the most unrepresentative election in UK history—

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,658
—thanks again First Past the Post,
click here for more details—

14
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,339
and the promised referendum was scheduled.

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,819
With huge voter turnout, Brexit won 52 to 48.

16
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,019
So what happens next?

17
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,079
Well, the EU has a law called Article 50
saying countries can exit.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,939
Basically it's a "press here to leave" button.

19
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,239
But the Conservative Prime Minister who promised
upon Brexit victory to press it immediately,

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,679
instead resigned immediately,
leaving the UK politically doing nothing.

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,979
There was talk of a second Brexit—

22
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,279
"No-but-seriously-it-might-actually-happen-if-you-vote-for-it-this-one-is-legally-binding-Referendum",

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,639
or re-electing Parliament.

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,939
But then the new UK Prime Minister was appointed
and she said that wouldn't happen.

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,709
Presumably the UK Parliament
now needs to pass a

26
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,679
"Yes we are really pressing the Brexit button law",

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,459
but they seem to be in no rush.

28
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,219
Meanwhile the EU wants the UK to get on with it,
but the UK wants to pre-decide

29
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,039
all the details of what an independent
UK's relationship with the EU would look like,

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,859
but the EU doesn't want to talk
until the UK actually leaves.

31
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,319
Not surprising because talking before gives negotiating
advantage to the UK, and talking after to the EU,

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,219
and since the EU can't force the UK to press the button,

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,079
there's a sort of negotiating stalemate.

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,479
Finally, because there's really
no procedure for anything,

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,839
the only correct answer to
"What happens next?" is...

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,719
"Who knows!"

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,079
We are standing in a fog with naught
but speculation, so...

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,529
Speculation time!

39
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,219
Acting as a Brexit bookie, I'm putting 15% odds
on the chance of Maximum Brexit occurring,

40
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,139
where the UK is a fully independent nation, with total
control over her trade deals and immigration and laws.

41
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,199
The UK is to the EU as Brazil is to the EU:
just another country.

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,199
If that probability seems low, what with
the new pro-Brexit Prime Minister,

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,319
and with the required going against
the will of the people and all,

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,669
here's my reasoning why.
Speculation the 1st:

45
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,379
The Conservatives didn't want the UK
to really leave the EU.

46
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,559
Though they campaigned for the referendum,
they were officially neutral on the issue,

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,019
and, I suspect, privately against.

48
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,899
If you think the Conservatives are
the more business friendly party,

49
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,538
the UK leaving the EU would be
bad news for many businesses

50
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,339
that prefer larger economic blocs – like banks.

51
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,519
Pre-2015 election,
the Conservatives probably thought

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,259
citizens wouldn't really vote for Brexit,
so they could safely gamble to sway UKIP voters,

53
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,319
but again – surprise! – 52 to 48.

54
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,719
Even the new prime minister,
who's all "Brexit means Brexit",

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,749
was against it before she got her current job.
Speculation the 2nd:

56
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,739
Some Brexiteers didn't really want to win either.
The Brexit campaign admitted after winning,

57
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,259
they have zero plans what to do, which sounds a lot like
"We never planned to win."

58
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,219
The leadership of UKIP resigned – an odd choice on
what should be a theoretical crowning moment of glory,

59
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,979
and after the Conservative Prime Minister resigned, the
most prominent Brexiteers didn't want to take the job.

60
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,799
Funny, that.

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,379
Also interesting to note:
the referendum was set up to have zero legal power,

62
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,679
something all the parties agreed on before hand.

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,659
It was essentially an opinion poll,
though not at all marketed that way to voters.

64
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,359
All this is to speculate the majority of
people in power do not want Brexit to happen.

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,179
To be clear, while governments could just totally
ignore the vote and still be technically correct,

66
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,569
there's no way that doesn't look
horrifically undemocratic.

67
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,519
But, while Brexit was sold on the idea
of a stronger independent Britain,

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,579
the international markets and national
economy have strongly disagreed,

69
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,539
and the geography of the vote have indicated
it might not be the whole of Britain leaving.

70
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,639
After the vote, Scotland immediately said that
if the UK leaves the EU, Scotland isn't coming.

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,519
She voted to stay, so she will.

72
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,589
If maximum Brexit occurs, I put 97% odds
on Scotland leaving the UK and staying with the EU.

73
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,839
Add to that, if Scotland leaves, I give 45% odds
of Northern Ireland leaving as well,

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,259
rejoining Ireland Ireland.

75
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,499
And, crazy as it sounds,
if Scotland and Northern Ireland leave,

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,559
I'll actually put 5% odds
on London leaving England

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,979
and becoming an independent city-state in the EU,
which would be kind of awesome,

78
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,899
because who doesn't love city-states?

79
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,399
This would leave England and Wales on their own,

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,159
and of course while it's possible they'd do just fine –
there are plenty of comparable independent nations –

81
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,999
the international markets have already said
"do not want" to just the UK leaving as a whole,

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,099
so I wouldn't bet on it being a rosy future,

83
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,879
and it's probably not something many Brexit voters
would have picked were it on the referendum.

84
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,659
But even ignoring the breakup of the Union,
when thinking about the likelihood of Maximum Brexit,

85
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,099
on one side are the majority of people
who voted for it,

86
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,659
and on the other side are
the businesses and the politicians,

87
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,328
even, I speculate,
many who pretend to be for it.

88
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,768
The politics of power here is why
I give such low odds to maximum Brexit,

89
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,009
and why I give 30% odds to the second option:
literally, nothing happens.

90
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,838
The UK government plays the stalling game forever,
pretending to move forward while doing nothing.

91
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,639
This politically tumultuous time becomes
a trivia fact for a future video

92
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,259
about how the UK has been in the process
of "leaving" the EU for a hundred years,

93
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,779
like when countries sometimes discover
they're technically still at war

94
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,919
because there's an old declaration they forgot to annul.

95
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,279
It's not a great outcome, because governments and
businesses and people don't like uncertainty,

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,659
but never underestimate the human ability to
procrastinate on paperwork.

97
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,699
Even Miss "Brexit means Brexit"
is also Miss "Mustn't be too hasty"

98
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,179
about actually pressing the Article 50 button.

99
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,948
But the last option I think is the most likely:

100
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,408
55% odds on a non-Brexit Brexit.

101
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,479
The European Union has many asterisks
and layers to her membership.

102
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,359
The UK could leave the European Union,

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,519
slide over into the European Economic Area,
and be technically correct that she's left the EU.

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,279
Actually, before this whole brouhaha,
the UK had arranged a deal with the EU

105
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,039
to become more like an EEA member,
that was dropped once the referendum started,

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,539
but that deal is lying on a table somewhere...
(just saying)

107
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,979
This would be the most pure compromise,
leaving both sides...

108
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,779
unhappy.

109
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,019
Nothing Brexit voters actually
cared about would change:

110
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,639
Immigration, EU membership fees and binding EU laws,
all this would remain the same.

111
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,719
The only thing different would be the UK giving up
all her representatives in the EU Parliament,

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,799
so she would have zero influence on EU law
she would still have to follow,

113
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,539
which is not something pro-EU voters
probably wanted either.

114
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,879
But nonetheless, I give the greatest odds
of this happening

115
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,719
because nothing would change for businesses,
making them happy,

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,228
and for politicians it's a face-saving maneuver
to have "listened to the people" and to "leave"

117
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,679
while doing neither and possibly avoiding
the breakup of the United Kingdom.

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,639
Who wants to be prime minister during that?

119
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,379
In conclusion: None of these outcomes are clean wins.

120
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,739
The first is very probably the end of the United Kingdom,

121
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,149
and goes against what seems to be
economic self-interest – but maybe not, who knows? –

122
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,889
and the other to go against, like, the idea of democracy.

123
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,598
The UK stands at a path that splits into many futures.

124
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,079
Maybe the EU burns herself to the ground
due to all her problems,

125
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,399
and "Wales-gland" rises from the ashes
a mighty phoenix.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,479
Maybe the UK gets the worst of everything;
maybe literally nothing changes.

127
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,599
Which leads where? Which is the best?
It's impossible to know.

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,699
The UK can only stand in the fog,
speculate, and pick a path.

129
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,539
Good luck, United Kingdom,
