1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,219
YouTube Red, not mentioned in the main video,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,439
is YouTube's second source of income that avoids the whole

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,699
advertiser auction by getting viewers to pay monthly to hide the ads and get access to exclusive content.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,899
YouTube keeps the exact split of revenue a secret,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,619
only saying that creators get a majority,

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,339
but whatever that percent is, that portion of the money collected from subscribers is divided among

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,479
all creators based on what percent of total time on YouTube their videos are watched.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,839
Doing a very ballpark estimate,

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,699
channels with short videos might get around 5% additional revenue from Red,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,599
and channels with really long videos that are watched might get 40 to 50% more.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,459
It's worth noting that per view a YouTube subscriber is worth more to both YouTube and creators,

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,879
not just in dollars, but also in stability.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,679
Their monthly payments are predictable unlike the ad auctions,

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,800
So, it shouldn't be a surprise if YouTube continues to try to turn more subscribers and countries Red.
