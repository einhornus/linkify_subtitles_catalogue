# How Many Countries are There?

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,479
How many countries are there?

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,119
Easy: just grab a map and start counting,
yes?

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,119
No.

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,619
Not all maps are created equal -- borders
will differ depending on who you got the map

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,619
from.

7
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,168
So if individuals disagree, then surely a
committee will save the day.

8
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,908
Go to the United Nations, find the room where
countries sit -- each with a little name tag

9
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:17,769
-- start counting and get an answer.

10
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,859
Now of course, countries come and countries
go, but at the time this video was made the

11
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,739
answer is 193.

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,969
Fastest video ever, right?

13
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,139
Except: you know this isn't over.

14
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,948
The United Nations list is less a complete
class roster than a club membership that doesn't

15
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:30,948
include everyone.

16
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:34,549
Take, Vatican City who is a country but is
too cool for school when it comes to being

17
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,738
a member of the United Nations.

18
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,799
And while Vatican City's exact situation is…
complicated he's straightforward compared

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,828
to other non-United Nations countries… or
places -- the terminology is going to have

20
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,359
a be a bit, unclear here.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,459
Take Kosovo, who want's to join the UN club,
but membership requires none of these five

22
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,808
countries to reject you.

23
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:54,209
And while the United States, The United Kingdom
and France think Kosovo is a country, Russia

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,569
and China think she's just a rebellious part
of Serbia and so veto her membership.

25
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,858
As for everyone else, just over half recognize
Kosovo as independent and Kosovo, adorably,

26
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,659
has a website where she thanks each one in
their own language.

27
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,499
But Kosovo, is not there only other…

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,619
place that wants to be considered a real country.

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,389
There's Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh Republic,
Abkhazia, and South Ossetia.

30
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,799
Which might, or might not, be part of Moldova,
Azerbaijan or Georgia depending on who you

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,799
ask.

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,799
Two of these…

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,929
countries, no UN members recognize as countries,
and other two have only five supporters.

34
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,769
Though all four of these...

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,779
places recognize each other as countries.

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,329
There's also The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic
and Northern Cyprus each with their own supporters.

37
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,329
At this point you might be thinking 'OK, srsly,
what's the deal?

38
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,779
I don't care who these guys think are countries,
are these places countries or not?'

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,389
If I fly to one for a Holliday, will it *look*
like a country when I get there?

40
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,189
The answer is, 'maybe'.

41
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,189
These...

42
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,389
countries are all autonomous, to some extent,
with governments that issue passports though

43
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,809
these may be of rather limited use and depending
on which ones you're visiting they may have

44
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,429
more or less control of the territory they
claim as theirs.

45
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,589
You won't always find a clear border.

46
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,979
What makes many of these places... fuzzy is
they're *usually* born of conflict in the

47
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,979
recent-ish past.

48
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,388
That answer is probably less helpful than
you want so think of it like this: while The

49
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,139
United States is clearly a country now, in
1776, not so much.

50
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,688
Then she was just an idea in minds of rebel
scum.

51
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:18,438
She wasn't recognized as a country instantly
and without diplomatic effort to change that

52
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,128
Young America would never have made it on
her own.

53
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,188
Much like what happened a century later when
she got her own rebel who, unlike elder sister,

54
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:28,059
failed in the diplomacy department so… yeah.

55
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,229
And so it goes today with many of the maybe
countries in the world.

56
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,378
Maybe they're future United States and maybe
they're future Confederacies -- but in the

57
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,139
moment it's hard to say -- because these things
can take decades to settle.

58
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,158
By the way, these maybe-countries are super
awkward for countries to deal with.

59
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,999
While your tiny island nation might not want
to get involved in the affairs of distant

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,259
lands you still have to decide to send a diplomat,
or not -- meaning even inaction forces you

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,709
to pick a side in *every territorial skirmish
in the world*.

62
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,559
A notably awkward case being: Taiwan…

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,169
errr, sorry, Chinese Taipei which is *totally*
part of China and no one would ever think

64
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,169
otherwise…

65
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,878
Is China gone?

66
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,268
OK: by any reasonable definition, Taiwan is
a separate country and has been for years,

67
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,509
but China won't let go and insists you call
her Chinese Taipei and don't forget who makes

68
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,689
all your clothing and utensils and TVs and
phones and computers and everything.

69
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,399
So almost all countries -- including the mighty
United States -- plays along even though they

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,998
unofficially acknowledge Taiwan's independence
and do things that wouldn't make any senses

71
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:25,749
otherwise -- like sending aircraft carriers
to protect one part of China from another

72
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,018
part of China.

73
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,699
Thus the innocent question 'how many countries?'

74
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,238
has led us straight to a big 'World War III:
Press Here to Start' button which is getting

75
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,378
depressing so lets move on to...

76
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,908
Ohhhh, right.

77
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:36,908
::sigh::

78
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:41,639
No more politics: on to higher ideas: The
Olympics.

79
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,059
Surely from their perch among the gods they
have a disinterested view of the countries

80
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,059
below.

81
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,169
"How many are there, Olympics?"

82
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,628
Two hundred and four?

83
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,628
Huh.

84
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,628
So Olympics is a bit…

85
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:51,628
special.

86
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:54,229
She defines Puerto Rico as a 'country' even
though it's unambiguously part of the United

87
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,119
States as well as Bermuda and Aruba which
are connected to the UK and The Netherlands

88
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,128
along with a bunch of other places that are
happy to play in her Olympic Games as Nations

89
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:04,399
but make no claims to independence.

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,389
Presumably, Olympics includes these to bump
up the number so she can say 'more than 200

91
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,389
countries compete!'

92
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,479
Though even her inflated list doesn't include
Vatican City -- because, given his demographics,

93
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,309
divine intervention would be required to take
home a gold.

94
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,759
And Vatican City brings us right back to the
core of the difficulty with this question:

95
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,379
a consistent definition of 'country' is impossible
because your checklist needs to both include

96
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,259
Vatican City the least country-like country
that's still a country -- and that also exclude

97
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,059
the Anti-Vatican City: Hong Kong: -- the most
country-like country that isn't.

98
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,059
Also don't forget from previous episodes the
seemingly endless territories which look and

99
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,169
act like independent countries, but just sort
of aren't.

100
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,889
And this isn't even brining up the various
Nutters who plant a flag on an Island, or

101
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,349
an oil rig, start printing currency on their
fancy inkjet and declare Deludtopia a new

102
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,349
nation.

103
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,089
So with no checklist to follow where does
that leave us?

104
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,659
The best answer to the question 'how many
countries' for the forceable future is probably

105
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,589
to say 'around 200' and leave it at that.

106
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,339
An answer with more significant figures implies
more agreement than there really is -- because

107
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,319
ultimately, what makes a country a country
is if other countries think that country is

108
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:24,370
a country.
