1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,619
Thinking of your phone as an extension of yourself isn’t crazy.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,419
To say that your phone knows more about you than you know about you isn’t an exaggeration

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,019
It's a statement of fact.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,879
Do you remember your location every minute of every day?

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,119
Do you remember what you said to your friend last leap day at 10:47 word-for-word?  Yeah,  of course not.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,639
Hell, without photos, entire holidays would slide out of your mind.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,599
While paperwork that tracks us has existed since papyrus

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,559
Without people feeling like those hieroglyphs were literally an extension of the human mind

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,099
A phone can hold the equivalent of millions of papyrus pages.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,159
At some point a difference of amount becomes a difference of kind.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,699
Since you bought it, how many hours has your phone been more than an arm's reach away?

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,859
Possibly zero.  There's no other object like that in your life.

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,239
Given the choice to have someone read your mind or read your phone,

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,459
If you seriously think about it, you’d probably pick the former.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:59,159
Compared to what's in your phone your brain holds a tiny amount of information, much of it wrong, all of it lossy.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,179
It's easy to forget what kind of embarrassment your phone contains,

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,499
Because it has so much you can't even remember

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,459
As you discover when someone flips through a bunch of photos you thought were safe

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,299
But suddenly discover aren't.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,819
And while the phone now is an extension of the self: we all know where this is going.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,579
A computer chip in your skull will eventually be as quasi-mandatory as a phone is today

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,819
And avoiding one will make you seem Amish.

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,339
If we don't protect our most intimate digital devices as part of the self, legally,

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,559
We're going to be in some scary places in the future.

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,399
Because the law is a complicated brick structure of individuals laws each resting on what came before.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,359
This is why you hear lawyers argue based on laws from three hundred years ago:

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,379
That's not by insanity but by design.

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,639
And it’s why people freak out over court cases that lay down a new brick in a new area --

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,159
It's not about this brick.  It's about what will, inevitably, be built on top of it.

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:04,439
To argue, "Don't worry, this law is just for this case, this time." is to argue against what the law is.

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,758
Like a chess player saying to his opponent, ‘This move isn’t about future moves’.

32
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,459
That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,499
Three hundred years ago someone writes a law about papers in your house

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,999
At a time when papers and books were luxury items and half the population, illiterate

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,839
And then it's applied to millions of intangible files on your phone

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,619
Which, in aggregate, record every detail of your life.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,799
Maybe you think that's good. Maybe you don't. But either way, the modern law is built atop the old.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,899
And it's why people are right to be concerned about each precedent-setting law

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,739
And why 'slippery-slope fallacy' does not apply here.

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,439
Thinking about today's law is thinking about future law and access to your phone today

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,500
Is, unavoidably, about access to your mind tomorrow.
