1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,090
Did you set a New Year’s Resolution for yourself? 

2
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:03,290
How's that going?

3
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,541
I don't know when in the year you're watching,

4
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:08,616
but if I had to bet on the status of your resolution,

5
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:12,467
it's probably not flourishing, but failed or foregone.

6
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:16,410
This is usually what the effort curve on resolutions looks like.

7
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,290
If New Year’s is new to you, you’re forgiven for not knowing.

8
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,147
But come on, this isn't your first Resolution Rodeo.

9
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:25,187
You've been here before: saddled up to a resolution.

10
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:26,924
Gotten thrown off in short order.

11
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:30,033
Only to come back next year to pick a buck of a different color.

12
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:31,439
Or worse, the same.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,181
Riding, rolling, retreating, returning.

14
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:38,627
Year after year after year of your unchanging life

15
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,290
until a disappointed reaper calls time.

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,370
New Year's Resolutions suck. 

17
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:45,781
Human behavior change is really hard.

18
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:49,016
And the Resolution Rodeo.  This is not the way.

19
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:51,724
Instead, to accomplish what you want out of resolutions,

20
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:54,193
positive life change (but in a better way),

21
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:56,719
allow me to suggest a gentler idea.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,719
Give yourself a theme.

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,787
Instead of setting yourself up to fail with,

24
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:03,404
“I'm going to lose x pounds by next year,” 

25
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:06,570
or "I'm going to read one book a week, at least”

26
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,336
a theme would be something like 'Year of Reading'

27
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:10,799
or 'Year of Health'.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,347
Now if that sounds a bit broad, that's the point.

29
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,004
For some things, precision matters.

30
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,490
For others, it doesn't.

31
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:20,067
And when trying to build yourself into a better version of yourself,

32
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:22,067
exact data points don't matter.

33
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:23,976
All that matters is the trend line.

34
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:26,627
If the trend is going in the right direction, so are you.

35
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,181
Just moving a trend from negative to positive is hard enough

36
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:33,621
without defining falling short of a goal as failure.

37
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:36,959
Heck, even just decelerating the negative is a positive.

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,050
Is there something you want more of in your life?

39
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:40,501
Something you want less of?

40
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:42,353
Well, life is a branching path.

41
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,010
And it's the trend of your decisions,

42
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,896
some big, but mostly small,

43
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,896
that will get you to more or less. 

44
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:49,507
Stuck in a queue, what to do?

45
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:52,399
Well, if it's the ‘Year of Reading,’ why not open the book,

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,673
instead of opening the anything else.

47
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:58,410
That's it: you were at a branch and went one way instead of the other. 

48
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:02,193
Having a theme is like creating a friendly bot to follow you on the path,

49
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:05,461
to help notice branches and consider choices with you,

50
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:09,163
reminding you to be a little different in little moments sometimes.

51
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,850
An example: one year my theme was 'Novelty.'

52
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:13,690
I felt like things had become too same-y.

53
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:18,433
Rather than resolve: “I'm going to do n new things per t time”

54
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:20,296
It was just… ‘Year of Novelty.’

55
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:23,724
So, when it made sense, why not try the new instead of the known?

56
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:25,084
It's the ‘Year of Novelty!’

57
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:28,696
Now, I didn't go crazy, but that time was more novel than normal.

58
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:29,793
Mission accomplished.

59
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:31,393
A good theme can't fail.

60
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:35,141
Because just having a theme-bot along will point out paths

61
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:36,799
you wouldn't have noticed otherwise,

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,330
which will start to change you.

63
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:39,804
More on that in a moment.

64
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:43,244
In picking a theme, go with something that has a nice broad name

65
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:46,376
for the general direction you want to navigate your life. 

66
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,690
And it is navigation.

67
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:51,267
The diverging paths of life are hidden under the fog of the future.

68
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:54,307
You can't plan the route and then fail to follow it,

69
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,930
because there is no map and unseen obstacles await.

70
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:00,147
At any moment, you are where you are

71
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,147
and can only navigate from there.

72
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,953
Perhaps you started a 'Year of Health'

73
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:05,530
focused on weight loss or gains,

74
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,467
before realizing there's a more foundational problem.

75
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,901
You haven't failed, it's still 'Year of Health.’

76
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:13,930
The broadness of a theme allows its meaning to change.

77
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,839
You started out wanting to read more books,

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,279
but maybe as you went on,

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,724
you realized academic papers are where it's at,

80
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:22,341
or that reading reading just doesn’t work for you

81
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:24,490
and listening reading is the way to go.

82
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,553
You’re still on theme.

83
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:27,896
The theme can change because so will you.

84
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:30,833
Having a theme, you will notice paths you didn't before.

85
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,119
This gets you to think about your thinking.

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,781
And thinking about your thinking changes your thinking,

87
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,679
which changes who you are.

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,833
So a broad theme allows its meaning to adapt with you,

89
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,633
without the guilt of having failed to meet the goals

90
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:46,193
of a Past You who doesn't exist any more.

91
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:48,273
I did 'Year of Order' for a while,

92
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,033
but what 'Order' meant to me at the end

93
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:52,764
was different from the start, and that’s fine.

94
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:57,027
So themes should be broad, directional, but most importantly: resonant.

95
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,856
Resonance is a physics phenomenon where,

96
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:02,010
if you have a glass, and tuning forks of different sizes,

97
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:04,273
bringing the right-sized humming tuning fork

98
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:06,993
near the glass makes it hum the same note.

99
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:09,427
Words are tuning forks for the brain.

100
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,530
When picking a theme, you're looking for a word or

101
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:14,867
words that cause your brain to vibrate in resonance.

102
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:18,239
I've been talking about themes for years and getting people to try them.

103
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,741
Here are some of the words I’ve seen people use.

104
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:23,519
The details of what they mean to anyone don't matter.

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,101
What matters is if there's something that strikes you.

106
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:27,553
Calls out to your brain.

107
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:28,913
That is resonance.

108
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:32,673
So pick a broad, directional phrase that resonates with you and run with it.

109
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,959
Your brain and the theme will make it work.

110
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,444
Now if this seems very hippy-dippy-lovey-dovey-huggy-wuggy-fuzzy-wuzzy…

111
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,313
That's fine.  Not all tools need sharp edges.

112
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,341
I think of it this way.

113
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:45,187
You should be trying to build a life you want to live,

114
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:48,844
and themes are a fuzzy, high-level, longer term way

115
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,987
to navigate your brain at a broad area of change.

116
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:55,759
Smaller, and specific-er are the systems in life you might want to set up,

117
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,290
below that are the targets those systems might or might not generate,

118
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,381
and at the most concrete and sharp

119
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:04,947
is the action or decision Current You is currently taking. 

120
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:07,850
This level of detail is perhaps a story for another time,

121
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,616
but creating a theme is the bigger and broader

122
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:12,341
to guide the smaller and shorter.

123
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:16,010
Lastly, you may have noticed the examples were all 'Year of $thing,' 

124
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:20,227
but that's mainly because I've been trying to gently introduce you to the idea.

125
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:23,884
Resolutions are a year, why not swap them for a theme instead? 

126
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,799
But if you're still here, a year is way long.

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,399
Again, fog of the future.

128
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,450
A season is a nice human length of time.

129
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,621
In a winter of learning, you can learn a lot, 

130
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:35,461
but you do need to get started,

131
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:38,753
because it's also not so long as to feel forever.

132
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:43,301
Nature's clock ticks on reminding you that flowers bloom but briefly, 

133
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,959
the summer sun will wane, 

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,799
leaves eventually drop, 

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,799
snow falls and snow melts, 

136
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,799
and flowers bloom but briefly.

137
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,039
You can be unchanging through all that,

138
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,410
but whenever you are, if you've never had a theme,

139
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:59,839
give yourself time to find one that resonates with you

140
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,067
and try it out in the coming season.

141
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:22,880
[birds softly chirping]
