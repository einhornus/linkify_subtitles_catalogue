Hello Internet

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,999
In my last video about Pluto you may have noticed,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,729
that i said aloud the names of every planet except one:

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,589
This one

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,329
And that was no accident,

6
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,469
but rather the result of carefull script editing.

7
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,889
Because, where i grew up,

8
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,309
i learned that the name of the seventh planet

9
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,589
is pronounced "yoo-Rain-us".

10
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,289
Of course to a kid "yoo-Rain-us" sounds an awful lot like "your-Anus",

11
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,639
which is how i and everyone i knew ended up saying the name.

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,129
Which is 
funny when you're a child, but becomes a bit of a problem, if you grew 
up

13
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,489
and trying to teach scientific facts about the planet.

14
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,449
for example:

15
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,119
Uranus has a ring around it.

16
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,419
Astronomers have discoverd a dark spot on Uranus.

17
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,959
Uranus is a gas giant.

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,699
Uranus is surrounded by methane.

19
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,479
There is a solution to this problem, the alternative pronunsiation of 
the name,

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,033
wich goes:
YUR-in-us

21
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:44,472
And most scientists in public roles do use this pronunciation.

22
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:46,768
But for me YUR-in-us is still problematic.

23
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,866
Sure, it's better then your-Anus, but it's still URINE-us.

24
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:53,064
And perhaps i'm just childish, but when someone else says YUR-in-us,

25
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:57,374
i still hear your-ANUS in my head and it just draws more
attention to the unfortunate name.

26
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,974
The tragedy is, it didn't have to be this way.

27
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:03,168
The seventh planet from the sun is unique because it's the first Planet we discovered.

28
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:09,773
For all of human history the sixth closest planets were big enough or bright enough to see with just our 
limited simian eyes.

29
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:16,861
But the next planet was to dim to see until our telescope technology got good enough for british 
astronomer Wilhelm Herschel to spot it in 1781.

30
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:24,578
Understandably though he didn't think he discoverd a new planet, since from the 
rise of modern humans 50 thousand years earlier until that Thursday no one ever had.

31
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:27,428
But discover he did and so choose a 
name he must

32
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,951
and Herschel, being the good subject of the crown that he was,

33
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:33,695
christened his new planet "The Georgium Sidis", 
which means "The Georgian Star".

34
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,449
And the George in "The Georgian Star" was King George the third the reigning monarch.

35
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,012
While King George liked the name, the rest of the world did not

36
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:44,976
and decided that perhaps Herschel wasn't the best guy to name the 
new planet after all

37
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:47,662
and quickly decided to come up with alternatives of their own.

38
00:01:47,663 --> 00:01:53,912
One suggestion was Neptun, which is confusing to us now, but at the time the planet that would become Neptun had 
not yet been found.

39
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:57,755
A more obvious alternative was to name the planet Herschel after the man who discovered it.

40
00:01:57,756 --> 00:02:04,718
Even in Great Britain the name "The Georgium Sidis" proofed a bit stuffy for some, so variance like "The Georgian Planet", 
or just "Georgium" were also used.

41
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,313
Though never, as you might have heard, "George". 

42
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:08,394
Sidenote here:

43
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:15,603
While researching this video i found a lot of websites claiming that the seventh planet was almost 
named "George", but i was never able to find a primary source for this.

44
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:20,159
As best i could tell searching from documents 
from the time no one ever suggested this name.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,648
I checked with the Royal Institution who, since 1799, has been 
promoting sciences awesomeness from the heart of London and whose videos you should now go watch,

46
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:32,394
and they confirmed the 
name "George" was never on the table, because to so casual refer to the King at the time would have been disrespectful.

47
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:35,653
And disrespect a monarch is never a good idea.

48
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:40,889
Especially one who is slowly loosing his mind from a genetic disorder, but that's a story for another time.

49
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,306
Anyway, another real suggestion for the new planets name came from Johann Bode who suggested the greek god of the sky.

50
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:53,759
When a colleague of Bode discovered the 92 element in 1789, he named it Uranium to support Bode's choice and try and 
end the debate.

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,970
Perhaps because these two were German it might not have occurred to them how the word would eventually be corrupted in english. 

52
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:04,204
Though it's also hard to know how english speakers in the 1780's and 90's 
would have pronounced the name. 

53
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,371
But since the word anus was in the language then, 

54
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:09,904
it seems unlikely, that this particular pronunciation would have been popular. 

55
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:13,423
It may also have been pronunced with a flat "a" to sound like 
yoo-RA-nus, 

56
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:16,086
or something more like the Greek name oo-RON-ohs. 

57
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:18,235
These names competed with each other over decades, 

58
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:18,997
for example: 

59
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:23,148
still in 1823, the Encyclopedia Britannica list the planet as "Herschel",

60
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,527
notes the alternative names

61
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:28,817
and then proceeds to carefully word the rest of the artikel to avoid naming the planet again. 

62
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:34,043
With you a dear modern day 
viewer know that eventually this alternatives faded and left this name triumphant.

63
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:39,707
Which leaves someone like me with 
my terrible pronunciation longing for history to have taken a different path.

64
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:45,678
The name "Herschel" might have made the planet sound a bit like a boring accountant rather than a very intresting planet 
it actually is,

65
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,106
but this would still be a much better name than what we have.

66
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:52,697
Neptune is obviously a fine planetary name 
though picking this might have just delayed the problem. 

67
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:59,137
finally "The Georgium Sidis" is a bit awkward and in sillier moments i wish that Herschel had just been more direct and 
named it "King George",

68
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,288
because how fun would that make it to teach kids the list of planets today.

69
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:06,478
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, King George and Neptun.

70
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:13,206
In classrooms such an unusual name would change the planet from a thing to avoid to a starting point for a 
discussion about what makes that Planet different 

71
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:17,528
and how astronomy and our view of the universe change and 
progress over time.

72
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,597
But my impractical dreams aside we're stuck with this name,

73
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:27,870
which for me means choosing between 
the pronunciation which comes naturally and is terrible, or the unnatural awkward one which is still unsatisfactory.

74
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:29,331
So what's a man to do? 

75
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:34,275
In the end, probably follow the lead of the Encyclopaedia Britannica and avoid the name when 
possible.

76
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:50,394
Which is a sad fate for the planet in our solar system with such an interesting story to tell.

77
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:56,693
Seriously people, could we at least agree to switch the pronunciation back to the greek oo-RON-ohs? It's clearly so 
much better.
