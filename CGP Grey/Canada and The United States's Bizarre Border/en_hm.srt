1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,588
Canada and the United States share the longest,
straightest, possibly boringest border in

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,539
the world. But, look closer, and there's plenty
of bizarreness to be found.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,129
While these sister nations get along fairly
well, they both want to make it really clear

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,348
whose side of the continent is whose. And
they've done this by carving a 20-foot wide

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:21,348
space along the border. All five and a half
thousand miles of it.

6
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:24,769
With the exception of the rare New England
town that predates national borders or the

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,019
odd airport that needed extending, this space
is the no-touching-zone between the countries

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,659
and they're super serious about keeping it
clear. It matters not if the no-touching-zone

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,219
runs through hundreds of miles of virtually
uninhabited Alaskan / Yukon wilderness. Those

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,369
border trees, will not stand.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,469
Which might make you think this must be the
longest, straightest deforested place in the

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,499
world, but it isn't. Deforested: yes, but
straight? Not at all.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,339
Sure it looks straight and on a map, and the
treaties establishing the line *say* it's

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,979
straight... but in the real world the official
border is 900 lines that zig-zags from the

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,019
horizontal by as much as several hundred feet.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,919
How did this happen? Well, imagine you're
back in North America in the 1800s -- The

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,069
49th parallel (one of those horizontal lines
you see on a globe) has just been set as the

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,449
national boundary and it's your job to make
it real. You're handed a compass and a ball

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,579
of string and told to carefully mark off the
next 2/3rds of a continent. Don't mind that

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,559
uncharted wilderness in the way: just keep
the line straight.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,989
Yeah.

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,859
Good luck.

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,459
With that.

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,639
The men who surveyed the land did the best
they could and built over 900 monuments. They're

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,769
in about as straight as you could expect a
pre-GPS civilization to make, but it's not

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,779
the kind of spherical / planar intersection
that would bring a mathematician joy.

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,158
Nonetheless these monuments define the border
and the no-touching-zone plays connect-the-dots

28
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:39,919
with them.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,559
Oh, and while there are about 900 markers
along this section of the border, there are

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,688
about 8,000 in total that define the shape
of the nations.

31
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:52,089
Despite this massive project Canada and the
United States still have disputed territory.

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,079
There is a series of islands in the Atlantic
that the United States claims are part of

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,709
Maine and Canada claims are part of New Brunswick.
Canada, assuming the islands are hers built

34
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,569
a lighthouse on one of them, and the United
States, assuming the islands are hers pretends

35
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,449
the lighthouse doesn't exist.

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,518
It's not a huge problem as the argument is
mostly over tourists who want to see puffins

37
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:14,318
and fishermen who want to catch lobsters,
but let's hope the disagreement gets resolved

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,048
before someone finds oil under that lighthouse.

39
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,929
Even the non-disputed territory has a few
notably weird spots: such as this tick of

40
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,589
the border upward into Canada. Zoom in and
it gets stranger as the border isn't over

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,649
solid land but runs through a lake to cut
off a bit of Canada before diving back down

42
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,708
to the US.

43
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,789
This spot is home to about 100 Americans and
is a perfect example of how border irregularities

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,608
are born:

45
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:38,818
Back in 1783 when the victorious Americans
were negotiating with the British who controlled

46
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,818
what would one day be Canada, they needed
a map, and this map was the best available

47
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,858
at the time. While the East Coast looks pretty
good, the wester it goes the sparser it gets.

48
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:52,958
Under negotiation was the edge of what would
one day be Minnesota and Manitoba. But unfortunately,

49
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,899
that area was hidden underneath an inset on
the map, so the Americans and British were

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,679
bordering blind. Seriously.

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,408
They guessed that the border should start
from the northwestern part of this lake and

52
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:07,509
go in a horizontal line until it crossed the
Mississippi... somewhere.

53
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,759
But somewhere, turned out to be nowhere as
the mighty Mississippi stops short of that

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,138
line, which left the border vague until 35
years later when a second round of negotiations

55
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,979
established the aforementioned 49th parallel.

56
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,128
But there was still a problem as the lake
mentioned earlier was both higher, and less

57
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:26,938
circular than first though, putting its northwesterly
point here so the existing border had to jump

58
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,158
up to meet it and then drop straight down
to the 49th, awkwardly cutting off a bit of

59
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,289
Canada, before heading west across the remainder
of the continent.

60
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,108
Turns out you just can't draw a straight(-ish)
line for hundreds of miles without causing

61
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,698
a few more problems.

62
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:43,808
One of which was luckily spotted in advance:
Vancouver Island, which the 49th would have

63
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:47,838
sliced through, but both sides agreed that
would be dumb so the border swoops around

64
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:48,578
the island.

65
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,708
However, next door to Vancouver Island is
Point Roberts which went unnoticed as so today

66
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,388
the border blithey cuts across. It's a nice
little town, home to over 1,000 Americans,

67
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,608
but has only a primary school so its older
kids have to cross international borders four

68
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,978
times a day to go to school in their own state.

69
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,298
In a pleasing symetry, the East cost has the
exact opposite situation with a Canadian Island

70
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,278
whose only land route is a bridge to the United
States.

71
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:15,098
And these two aren't the only places where
each country contains a bit of the other:

72
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,309
there are several more, easily spotted in
sattelite photos by the no-touching zone.

73
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,749
Regardless of if the land in question is just
an uninhabited strip, in the middle of a lake,

74
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,750
in the middle of nowhere, the border between
these sister nations must remain clearly marked.
