1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,999
When.  Do you want.  To die?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,879
The Reaper is busy, but he can fit you in right now.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,819
Too soon?  Later, perhaps?

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,219
Future You will keep the appointment?

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,339
Old and with a life fully lived,...

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,879
...perhaps ever so slightly bored and ready?

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,799
Now You might think that, ...

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,579
...but when the appointment whipper-snapper You set comes...

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,599
...it is not in the future, because you don't live in the future.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,259
You always live in the Now.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,299
And thus, you always die now.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,359
Because the Reaper comes for all eventually,...

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,539
…humans have formed a relationship with death perverse.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,919
Like a hostage who grows to love their kidnapper, …

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,499
…humans tell themselves the handful of decades the reaper gives them is just the right length, …

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,039
…that living a truly long and healthy life would get boring…

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,479
… and would be unnatural and imagine all the problems if death took a holiday.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,479
And so the Reaper of Age whispers that he is your friend, always near: …

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,419
…growing humans bigger, stronger, healthier, and smarter -- at first.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,899
Then comes his harvest of slow rot.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,919
Death is a part of life, he whispers. "Death gives life meaning,"

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,739
This is madness.

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,199
Misery doesn’t give happiness meaning.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,479
Happiness is meaning itself.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,499
If you tortured people to make them better appreciate the pleasures of life, you would be a monster.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,639
Just like this guy.

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,199
No parent would ask the Reaper of Age to wrinkle their child's skin, …

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,019
…weaken their bones, dim their vision, and their minds, …

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,159
…cripple them in a thousand ways over decades to ultimately kill them, "to give their life meaning".

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,419
But what can you do?

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,339
The world contains pain and death, …

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,279
…and so your brain believes the sweet lies that the horrors you can't avoid are good for you.

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,999
And while "Death is a part of life", …

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,479
…cholera was a part of life until humans developed wells and sewers to separate water from waste.

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,879
Shortsightedness is a part of life, until it isn't.

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,279
Just because a thing is natural doesn’t make it good or necessary.

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,199
It’s natural to live lives nasty, brutish, and short.

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,519
And it’s natural for humans to look at what indifferent nature provides as the starting point.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,159
As a to-do list, where humans focus, technology ever improves.

40
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,319
And with that, the ability to make lives better ever improves.

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,119
And just now some basic tools, …

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,519
…with real promise to slow or halt the decay are becoming visible on the horizon.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,919
Which raises the question: Just how strong is the Reaper of Age?

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,279
With enough time and attention can humans craft these basic tools into shields and swords to keep him at bay?

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,359
Possibly indefinitely?  Perhaps.

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,239
And if so, the first immortal generation may be alive today.

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,039
A generation that lives a healthy adulthood as long as they wish to.

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,679
But to make that happen, brains need be cleared of the millennia of death acceptance.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,039
Death is not a solution to future problems imagined.

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,879
Faced with the changes longer lives will bring,…

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,719
… humans will not miss the Reaper and construct one to solve their problems.

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,479
Just as with our larger cities, we don’t re-mix the water to bring back cholera.

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,199
Humans must discard the learned helplessness the Reaper and their own brains have imposed on them.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,639
To instead see the rot and decay not as natural and inevitable,…

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,399
… but as a degenerative disease to be attacked like all the others.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,319
As the degenerative disease that affects 100% of the population and is a source of misery untold.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,039
Misery not in your distant future, but in your now.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,359
And how soon we start the project of focusing our attention and shaping our tools against the Reaper matters.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,919
For the difference of but a day might determine what side of the future chasm you find yourself on.

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,679
Journeying forever forward or falling backward into the abyss.

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,119


62
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,439
 Is it too late for you?

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,959
We probably won’t win the war against death because death is all-powerful.

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,919
But we might be able to win the battle against the next best thing.

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,879
Aging itself.

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,078
There’s a realistic chance that you might live a longer and healthier life, but should we really do it?

67
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,439
We explore this in our video.

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:35,480
