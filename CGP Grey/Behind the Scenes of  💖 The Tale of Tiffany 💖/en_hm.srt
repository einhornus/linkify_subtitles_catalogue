Hello, Internet.

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,839
Each final, finished, precisely polished video you see

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,019
stands atop a mountain of material you don't.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,089
Books and papers,

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,759
and sometimes investigative travels,

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,389
time lost and confused

7
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,179
in the infinite diverging paths

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,999
of The Forest of All Knowledge.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,609
Writing a script to try to light the way.

10
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,949
The final video takes hundreds of human hours to carefully craft.

11
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,359
The whole mountain couldn't possibly fit in

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,359
otherwise there would never be a video.

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,929
But what has to be left out is sometimes heartbreaking!

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,639
Not to mention the Easter eggs

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,639
and little details that are put in

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,579
but can easily go unnoticed.

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,379
So, I'm going to talk about some of

18
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,599
the behind-the-scenes in a more casual, 

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,729
force-myself-not-to-prepare-too-much-otherwise-it'll-never-happen

20
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,229
Director’s Commentary for crowdfunders

21
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,059
who make all of this possible in the first place.

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,429
If when you clicked this video,

23
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,459
the thumbnail said 'LIVE' then, it's live right now.

24
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,879
I'm Director Commenting and you can join

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,509
the chat to ask questions about the newest video. 

26
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,409
If there was no ‘LIVE’

27
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,079
then you can watch the archive of previous ones.

28
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,089
So, if you're interested, please click here to sign up

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,539

30
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,719
I hope you like them, and thank you.

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:21,830
(soft playful electronic music fades out)
