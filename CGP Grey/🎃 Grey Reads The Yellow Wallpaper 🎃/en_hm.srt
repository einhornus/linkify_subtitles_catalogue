# The Yellow Wallpaper,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,278
by Charlotte Perkins Gilman

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,979
It is very seldom that mere ordinary people
like John and myself secure ancestral halls

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,138
for the summer.

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,009
A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I
would say a haunted house, and reach the height

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,229
of romantic felicity—but that would be asking
too much of fate!

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,799
Still I will proudly declare that there is
something queer about it.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,348
Else, why should it be let so cheaply?

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,729
And why have stood so long untenanted?

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,219
John laughs at me, of course, but one expects
that in marriage.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,089
John is practical in the extreme.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,619
He has no patience with faith, an intense
horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,988
at any talk of things not to be felt and seen
and put down in figures.

14
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,209
John is a physician, and perhaps—(I would
not say it to a living soul, of course, but

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,449
this is dead paper and a great relief to my
mind)—perhaps that is one reason I do not

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,609
get well faster.

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,359
You see, he does not believe I am sick!

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,929
And what can one do?

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,128
If a physician of high standing, and one’s
own husband, assures friends and relatives

20
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:08,499
that there is really nothing the matter with
one but temporary nervous depression—a slight

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,709
hysterical tendency—what is one to do?

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,419
My brother is also a physician, and also of
high standing, and he says the same thing.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,699
So I take phosphates or phosphites—whichever
it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air,

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,049
and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden
to “work” until I am well again.

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,359
Personally, I disagree with their ideas.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,919
Personally, I believe that congenial work,
with excitement and change, would do me good.

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,149
But what is one to do?

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,059
I did write for a while in spite of them;
but it does exhaust me a good deal—having

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,048
to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy
opposition.

30
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,989
I sometimes fancy that in my condition if
I had less opposition and more society and

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,850
stimulus—but John says the very worst thing
I can do is to think about my condition, and

32
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:56,269
I confess it always makes me feel bad.

33
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,919
So I will let it alone and talk about the
house.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,529
The most beautiful place!

35
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,648
It is quite alone, standing well back from
the road, quite three miles from the village.

36
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:09,429
It makes me think of English places that you
read about, for there are hedges and walls

37
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,199
and gates that lock, and lots of separate
little houses for the gardeners and people.

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,469
There is a delicious garden!

39
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,449
I never saw such a garden—large and shady,
full of box-bordered paths, and lined with

40
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,359
long grape-covered arbors with seats under
them.

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,419
There were greenhouses, too, but they are
all broken now.

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,009
There was some legal trouble, I believe, something
about the heirs and co-heirs; anyhow, the

43
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,539
place has been empty for years.

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,289
That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but
I don’t care—there is something strange

45
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,259
about the house—I can feel it.

46
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,949
I even said so to John one moonlight evening,
but he said what I felt was a draught, and

47
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,949
shut the window.

48
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,089
I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes.

49
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,409
I’m sure I never used to be so sensitive.

50
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,049
I think it is due to this nervous condition.

51
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,779
But John says if I feel so I shall neglect
proper self-control; so I take pains to control

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,539
myself,—before him, at least,—and that
makes me very tired.

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,459
I don’t like our room a bit.

54
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,009
I wanted one downstairs that opened on the
piazza and had roses all over the window,

55
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,329
and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings!
but John would not hear of it.

56
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,389
He said there was only one window and not
room for two beds, and no near room for him

57
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,459
if he took another.

58
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,818
He is very careful and loving, and hardly
lets me stir without special direction.

59
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,930
I have a schedule prescription for each hour
in the day; he takes all care from me, and

60
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:32,238
so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it
more.

61
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,419
He said we came here solely on my account,
that I was to have perfect rest and all the

62
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,529
air I could get.

63
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,139
“Your exercise depends on your strength,
my dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat

64
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,779
on your appetite; but air you can absorb all
the time.”

65
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,479
So we took the nursery, at the top of the
house.

66
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,869
It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly,
with windows that look all ways, and air and

67
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,349
sunshine galore.

68
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,869
It was nursery first and then playground and
gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows

69
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,719
are barred for little children, and there
are rings and things in the walls.

70
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,060
The paint and paper look as if a boys’ school
had used it.

71
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:11,969
It is stripped off—the paper—in great
patches all around the head of my bed, about

72
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,999
as far as I can reach, and in a great place
on the other side of the room low down.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,439
I never saw a worse paper in my life.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,629
One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns
committing every artistic sin.

75
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,448
It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following,
pronounced enough to constantly irritate,

76
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,888
and provoke study, and when you follow the
lame, uncertain curves for a little distance

77
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,079
they suddenly commit suicide—plunge off
at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,399
unheard-of contradictions.

79
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,999
The color is repellant, almost revolting;
a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,329
by the slow-turning sunlight.

81
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,559
It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places,
a sickly sulphur tint in others.

82
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,219
No wonder the children hated it!

83
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,668
I should hate it myself if I had to live in
this room long.

84
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:06,279
There comes John, and I must put this away,—he
hates to have me write a word.

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,279
## ---

86
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,909
We have been here two weeks, and I haven’t
felt like writing before, since that first

87
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,909
day.

88
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,359
I am sitting by the window now, up in this
atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to

89
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,089
hinder my writing as much as I please, save
lack of strength.

90
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,679
John is away all day, and even some nights
when his cases are serious.

91
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,069
I am glad my case is not serious!

92
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,719
But these nervous troubles are dreadfully
depressing.

93
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,959
John does not know how much I really suffer.

94
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,569
He knows there is no reason to suffer, and
that satisfies him.

95
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,009
Of course it is only nervousness.

96
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,689
It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in
any way!

97
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,409
I meant to be such a help to John, such a
real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative

98
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,129
burden already!

99
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,329
Nobody would believe what an effort it is
to do what little I am able—to dress and

100
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,719
entertain, and order things.

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,059
It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby.

102
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,549
Such a dear baby!

103
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,429
And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me
so nervous.

104
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,008
I suppose John never was nervous in his life.

105
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,129
He laughs at me so about this wallpaper!

106
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,609
At first he meant to repaper the room, but
afterwards he said that I was letting it get

107
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,638
the better of me, and that nothing was worse
for a nervous patient than to give way to

108
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,918
such fancies.

109
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,489
He said that after the wallpaper was changed
it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the

110
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,159
barred windows, and then that gate at the
head of the stairs, and so on.

111
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,460
“You know the place is doing you good,”
he said, “and really, dear, I don’t care

112
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:25,568
to renovate the house just for a three months’
rental.”

113
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,579
“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said,
“there are such pretty rooms there.”

114
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,888
Then he took me in his arms and called me
a blessed little goose, and said he would

115
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,189
go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed
into the bargain.

116
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,199
But he is right enough about the beds and
windows and things.

117
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,709
It is as airy and comfortable a room as any
one need wish, and, of course, I would not

118
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,198
be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just
for a whim.

119
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,168
I’m really getting quite fond of the big
room, all but that horrid paper.

120
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,299
Out of one window I can see the garden, those
mysterious deep-shaded arbors, the riotous

121
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,879
old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly
trees.

122
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,709
Out of another I get a lovely view of the
bay and a little private wharf belonging to

123
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,829
the estate.

124
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,008
There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs
down there from the house.

125
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:14,228
I always fancy I see people walking in these
numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned

126
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:16,989
me not to give way to fancy in the least.

127
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,489
He says that with my imaginative power and
habit of story-making a nervous weakness like

128
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,758
mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited
fancies, and that I ought to use my will and

129
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,079
good sense to check the tendency.

130
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,519
So I try.

131
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,879
I think sometimes that if I were only well
enough to write a little it would relieve

132
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,129
the press of ideas and rest me.

133
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,529
But I find I get pretty tired when I try.

134
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,758
It is so discouraging not to have any advice
and companionship about my work.

135
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,138
When I get really well John says we will ask
Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit;

136
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,568
but he says he would as soon put fire-works
in my pillow-case as to let me have those

137
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,679
stimulating people about now.

138
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,659
I wish I could get well faster.

139
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,729
But I must not think about that.

140
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,169
This paper looks to me as if it knew what
a vicious influence it had!

141
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:07,709
There is a recurrent spot where the pattern
lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes

142
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,799
stare at you upside-down.

143
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,089
I get positively angry with the impertinence
of it and the everlastingness.

144
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,649
Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those
absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere.

145
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,739
There is one place where two breadths didn’t
match, and the eyes go all up and down the

146
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,038
line, one a little higher than the other.

147
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,168
I never saw so much expression in an inanimate
thing before, and we all know how much expression

148
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,168
they have!

149
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,499
I used to lie awake as a child and get more
entertainment and terror out of blank walls

150
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,319
and plain furniture than most children could
find in a toy-store.

151
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,409
I remember what a kindly wink the knobs of
our big old bureau used to have, and there

152
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,229
was one chair that always seemed like a strong
friend.

153
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,159
I used to feel that if any of the other things
looked too fierce I could always hop into

154
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,639
that chair and be safe.

155
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,769
The furniture in this room is no worse than
inharmonious, however, for we had to bring

156
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,329
it all from downstairs.

157
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,919
I suppose when this was used as a playroom
they had to take the nursery things out, and

158
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,919
no wonder!

159
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,028
I never saw such ravages as the children have
made here.

160
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:13,099
The wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off
in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother—they

161
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,969
must have had perseverance as well as hatred.

162
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,489
Then the floor is scratched and gouged and
splintered, the plaster itself is dug out

163
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,528
here and there, and this great heavy bed,
which is all we found in the room, looks as

164
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:25,689
if it had been through the wars.

165
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,469
But I don’t mind it a bit—only the paper.

166
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,889
There comes John’s sister.

167
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,739
Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful
of me!

168
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,849
I must not let her find me writing.

169
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,289
She is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper,
and hopes for no better profession.

170
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,039
I verily believe she thinks it is the writing
which made me sick!

171
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,499
But I can write when she is out, and see her
a long way off from these windows.

172
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,369
There is one that commands the road, a lovely,
shaded, winding road, and one that just looks

173
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,569
off over the country.

174
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,829
A lovely country, too, full of great elms
and velvet meadows.

175
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,869
This wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in
a different shade, a particularly irritating

176
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,759
one, for you can only see it in certain lights,
and not clearly then.

177
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,749
But in the places where it isn’t faded,
and where the sun is just so, I can see a

178
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,309
strange, provoking, formless sort of figure,
that seems to sulk about behind that silly

179
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,239
and conspicuous front design.

180
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,969
There’s sister on the stairs!

181
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,969
## ---

182
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,819
Well, the Fourth of July is over!

183
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,099
The people are gone and I am tired out.

184
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,389
John thought it might do me good to see a
little company, so we just had mother and

185
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,389
Nellie and the children down for a week.

186
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,659
Of course I didn’t do a thing.

187
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,439
Jennie sees to everything now.

188
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,789
But it tired me all the same.

189
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,439
John says if I don’t pick up faster he shall
send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall.

190
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,239
But I don’t want to go there at all.

191
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,799
I had a friend who was in his hands once,
and she says he is just like John and my brother,

192
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,879
only more so!

193
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,749
Besides, it is such an undertaking to go so
far.

194
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,109
I don’t feel as if it was worth while to
turn my hand over for anything, and I’m

195
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,059
getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.

196
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,759
I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.

197
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,208
Of course I don’t when John is here, or
anybody else, but when I am alone.

198
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,289
And I am alone a good deal just now.

199
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,159
John is kept in town very often by serious
cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone

200
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,578
when I want her to.

201
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:20,409
So I walk a little in the garden or down that
lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses,

202
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,088
and lie down up here a good deal.

203
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,958
I’m getting really fond of the room in spite
of the wallpaper.

204
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,909
Perhaps because of the wallpaper.

205
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,039
It dwells in my mind so!

206
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,458
I lie here on this great immovable bed—it
is nailed down, I believe—and follow that

207
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,299
pattern about by the hour.

208
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,419
It is as good as gymnastics, I assure you.

209
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,989
I start, we’ll say, at the bottom, down
in the corner over there where it has not

210
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,409
been touched, and I determine for the thousandth
time that I will follow that pointless pattern

211
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,739
to some sort of a conclusion.

212
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,519
I know a little of the principle of design,
and I know this thing was not arranged on

213
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,229
any laws of radiation, or alternation, or
repetition, or symmetry, or anything else

214
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,708
that I ever heard of.

215
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,729
It is repeated, of course, by the breadths,
but not otherwise.

216
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,199
Looked at in one way each breadth stands alone,
the bloated curves and flourishes—a kind

217
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,989
of “debased Romanesque” with delirium
tremens—go waddling up and down in isolated

218
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,219
columns of fatuity.

219
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,458
But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally,
and the sprawling outlines run off in great

220
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:24,629
slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot
of wallowing seaweeds in full chase.

221
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,669
The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at
least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in

222
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,429
trying to distinguish the order of its going
in that direction.

223
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,929
They have used a horizontal breadth for a
frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion.

224
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,229
There is one end of the room where it is almost
intact, and there, when the cross-lights fade

225
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,789
and the low sun shines directly upon it, I
can almost fancy radiation after all,—the

226
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:53,099
interminable grotesques seem to form around
a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges

227
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,759
of equal distraction.

228
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,439
It makes me tired to follow it.

229
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,929
I will take a nap, I guess.

230
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,929
## ---

231
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,319
I don’t know why I should write this.

232
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,889
I don’t want to.

233
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,689
I don’t feel able.

234
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,278
And I know John would think it absurd.

235
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,289
But I must say what I feel and think in some
way—it is such a relief!

236
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,539
But the effort is getting to be greater than
the relief.

237
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,088
Half the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie
down ever so much.

238
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,889
John says I musn’t lose my strength, and
has me take cod-liver oil and lots of tonics

239
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,458
and things, to say nothing of ale and wine
and rare meat.

240
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:32,778
Dear John!

241
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,419
He loves me very dearly, and hates to have
me sick.

242
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,648
I tried to have a real earnest reasonable
talk with him the other day, and tell him

243
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,829
how I wish he would let me go and make a visit
to Cousin Henry and Julia.

244
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,359
But he said I wasn’t able to go, nor able
to stand it after I got there; and I did not

245
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,259
make out a very good case for myself, for
I was crying before I had finished.

246
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,489
It is getting to be a great effort for me
to think straight.

247
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,309
Just this nervous weakness, I suppose.

248
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,009
And dear John gathered me up in his arms,
and just carried me upstairs and laid me on

249
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,919
the bed, and sat by me and read to me till
it tired my head.

250
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,039
He said I was his darling and his comfort
and all he had, and that I must take care

251
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,879
of myself for his sake, and keep well.

252
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,719
He says no one but myself can help me out
of it, that I must use my will and self-control

253
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,679
and not let any silly fancies run away with
me.

254
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,759
There’s one comfort, the baby is well and
happy, and does not have to occupy this nursery

255
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,679
with the horrid wallpaper.

256
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,049
If we had not used it that blessed child would
have!

257
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,419
What a fortunate escape!

258
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,679
Why, I wouldn’t have a child of mine, an
impressionable little thing, live in such

259
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,109
a room for worlds.

260
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,229
I never thought of it before, but it is lucky
that John kept me here after all.

261
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,249
I can stand it so much easier than a baby,
you see.

262
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,170
Of course I never mention it to them any more,—I
am too wise,—but I keep watch of it all

263
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,958
the same.

264
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,479
There are things in that paper that nobody
knows but me, or ever will.

265
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,599
Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes
get clearer every day.

266
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,189
It is always the same shape, only very numerous.

267
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,189
And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping
about behind that pattern.

268
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,619
I don’t like it a bit.

269
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:17,719
I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John
would take me away from here!

270
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,719
## ---

271
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,099
It is so hard to talk with John about my case,
because he is so wise, and because he loves

272
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,099
me so.

273
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,669
But I tried it last night.

274
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,189
It was moonlight.

275
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,129
The moon shines in all around, just as the
sun does.

276
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:36,219
I hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly,
and always comes in by one window or another.

277
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,549
John was asleep and I hated to waken him,
so I kept still and watched the moonlight

278
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,909
on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.

279
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,838
The faint figure behind seemed to shake the
pattern, just as if she wanted to get out.

280
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,359
I got up softly and went to feel and see if
the paper did move, and when I came back John

281
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,359
was awake.

282
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,319
“What is it, little girl?” he said.

283
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,458
“Don’t go walking about like that—you’ll
get cold.”

284
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:05,258
I thought it was a good time to talk, so I
told him that I really was not gaining here,

285
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:06,929
and that I wished he would take me away.

286
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:11,349
“Why darling!” said he, “our lease will
be up in three weeks, and I can’t see how

287
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,349
to leave before.

288
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,289
“The repairs are not done at home, and I
cannot possibly leave town just now.

289
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,769
Of course if you were in any danger I could
and would, but you really are better, dear,

290
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,989
whether you can see it or not.

291
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,338
I am a doctor, dear, and I know.

292
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,979
You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite
is better.

293
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,749
I feel really much easier about you.”

294
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,189
“I don’t weigh a bit more,” said I,
“nor as much; and my appetite may be better

295
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,199
in the evening, when you are here, but it
is worse in the morning when you are away.”

296
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,689
“Bless her little heart!” said he with
a big hug; “she shall be as sick as she

297
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,689
pleases!

298
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,379
But now let’s improve the shining hours
by going to sleep, and talk about it in the

299
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,379
morning!”

300
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,479
“And you won’t go away?”

301
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,479
I asked gloomily.

302
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,028
“Why, how can I, dear?

303
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,778
It is only three weeks more and then we will
take a nice little trip of a few days while

304
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,479
Jennie is getting the house ready.

305
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,039
Really, dear, you are better!”

306
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,629
“Better in body perhaps”—I began, and
stopped short, for he sat up straight and

307
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,808
looked at me with such a stern, reproachful
look that I could not say another word.

308
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,529
“My darling,” said he, “I beg of you,
for my sake and for our child’s sake, as

309
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,368
well as for your own, that you will never
for one instant let that idea enter your mind!

310
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,759
There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating,
to a temperament like yours.

311
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,448
It is a false and foolish fancy.

312
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,868
Can you not trust me as a physician when I
tell you so?”

313
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,499
So of course I said no more on that score,
and we went to sleep before long.

314
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,709
He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn’t,—I
lay there for hours trying to decide whether

315
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,349
that front pattern and the back pattern really
did move together or separately.

316
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,499
On a pattern like this, by daylight, there
is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law,

317
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,969
that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.

318
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,239
The color is hideous enough, and unreliable
enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern

319
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,699
is torturing.

320
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,569
You think you have mastered it, but just as
you get well under way in following, it turns

321
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,459
a back somersault and there you are.

322
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,548
It slaps you in the face, knocks you down,
and tramples upon you.

323
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,149
It is like a bad dream.

324
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,489
The outside pattern is a florid arabesque,
reminding one of a fungus.

325
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,849
If you can imagine a toadstool in joints,
an interminable string of toadstools, budding

326
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,229
and sprouting in endless convolutions,—why,
that is something like it.

327
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,039
That is, sometimes!

328
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,359
There is one marked peculiarity about this
paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but

329
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,879
myself, and that is that it changes as the
light changes.

330
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,839
When the sun shoots in through the east window—I
always watch for that first long, straight

331
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,689
ray—it changes so quickly that I never can
quite believe it.

332
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,709
That is why I watch it always.

333
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,309
By moonlight—the moon shines in all night
when there is a moon—I wouldn’t know it

334
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,179
was the same paper.

335
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,379
At night in any kind of light, in twilight,
candlelight, lamplight, and worst of all by

336
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,389
moonlight, it becomes bars!

337
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,159
The outside pattern I mean, and the woman
behind it is as plain as can be.

338
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,499
I didn’t realize for a long time what the
thing was that showed behind,—that dim sub-pattern,—but

339
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,939
now I am quite sure it is a woman.

340
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,969
By daylight she is subdued, quiet.

341
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,178
I fancy it is the pattern that keeps her so
still.

342
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,179
It is so puzzling.

343
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,789
It keeps me quiet by the hour.

344
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,439
I lie down ever so much now.

345
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,418
John says it is good for me, and to sleep
all I can.

346
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:22,199
Indeed, he started the habit by making me
lie down for an hour after each meal.

347
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,409
It is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for,
you see, I don’t sleep.

348
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,979
And that cultivates deceit, for I don’t
tell them I’m awake,—oh, no!

349
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,979
The fact is, I am getting a little afraid
of John.

350
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,659
He seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie
has an inexplicable look.

351
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,459
It strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific
hypothesis, that perhaps it is the paper!

352
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,069
I have watched John when he did not know I
was looking, and come into the room suddenly

353
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,519
on the most innocent excuses, and I’ve caught
him several times looking at the paper!

354
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,639
And Jennie too.

355
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,058
I caught Jennie with her hand on it once.

356
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,039
She didn’t know I was in the room, and when
I asked her in a quiet, a very quiet voice,

357
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,019
with the most restrained manner possible,
what she was doing with the paper she turned

358
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,139
around as if she had been caught stealing,
and looked quite angry—asked me why I should

359
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,839
frighten her so!

360
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,339
Then she said that the paper stained everything
it touched, that she had found yellow smooches

361
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,548
on all my clothes and John’s, and she wished
we would be more careful!

362
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,599
Did not that sound innocent?

363
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,829
But I know she was studying that pattern,
and I am determined that nobody shall find

364
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,329
it out but myself!

365
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,329
## ---

366
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,019
Life is very much more exciting now than it
used to be.

367
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,908
You see I have something more to expect, to
look forward to, to watch.

368
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:37,599
I really do eat better, and am more quiet
than I was.

369
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,928
John is so pleased to see me improve!

370
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:43,519
He laughed a little the other day, and said
I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my

371
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,519
wallpaper.

372
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,619
I turned it off with a laugh.

373
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,369
I had no intention of telling him it was because
of the wallpaper—he would make fun of me.

374
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,269
He might even want to take me away.

375
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,849
I don’t want to leave now until I have found
it out.

376
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,339
There is a week more, and I think that will
be enough.

377
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,339
## ---

378
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,009
I’m feeling ever so much better!

379
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,619
I don’t sleep much at night, for it is so
interesting to watch developments; but I sleep

380
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,009
a good deal in the daytime.

381
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,819
In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.

382
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,959
There are always new shoots on the fungus,
and new shades of yellow all over it.

383
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,449
I cannot keep count of them, though I have
tried conscientiously.

384
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,879
It is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper!

385
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,019
It makes me think of all the yellow things
I ever saw—not beautiful ones like buttercups,

386
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,449
but old foul, bad yellow things.

387
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,609
But there is something else about that paper—the
smell!

388
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,509
I noticed it the moment we came into the room,
but with so much air and sun it was not bad.

389
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,369
Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and
whether the windows are open or not, the smell

390
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,369
is here.

391
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,159
It creeps all over the house.

392
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,469
I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking
in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in

393
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,459
wait for me on the stairs.

394
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,139
It gets into my hair.

395
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,149
Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head
suddenly and surprise it—there is that smell!

396
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,859
Such a peculiar odor, too!

397
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,589
I have spent hours in trying to analyze it,
to find what it smelled like.

398
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:10,209
It is not bad—at first, and very gentle,
but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor

399
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,969
I ever met.

400
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,629
In this damp weather it is awful.

401
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,179
I wake up in the night and find it hanging
over me.

402
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,109
It used to disturb me at first.

403
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,819
I thought seriously of burning the house—to
reach the smell.

404
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,229
But now I am used to it.

405
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,849
The only thing I can think of that it is like
is the color of the paper!

406
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,199
A yellow smell.

407
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,158
There is a very funny mark on this wall, low
down, near the mopboard.

408
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,589
A streak that runs round the room.

409
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:40,349
It goes behind every piece of furniture, except
the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as

410
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,788
if it had been rubbed over and over.

411
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:47,709
I wonder how it was done and who did it, and
what they did it for.

412
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:54,309
Round and round and round—round and round
and round—it makes me dizzy!

413
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,309
## ---

414
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,279
I really have discovered something at last.

415
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,589
Through watching so much at night, when it
changes so, I have finally found out.

416
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,339
The front pattern does move—and no wonder!

417
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,149
The woman behind shakes it!

418
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,899
Sometimes I think there are a great many women
behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls

419
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,169
around fast, and her crawling shakes it all
over.

420
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,899
Then in the very bright spots she keeps still,
and in the very shady spots she just takes

421
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,499
hold of the bars and shakes them hard.

422
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,139
And she is all the time trying to climb through.

423
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,459
But nobody could climb through that pattern—it
strangles so; I think that is why it has so

424
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,949
many heads.

425
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,969
They get through, and then the pattern strangles
them off and turns them upside-down, and makes

426
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,249
their eyes white!

427
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,979
If those heads were covered or taken off it
would not be half so bad.

428
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,979
## ---

429
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,979
I think that woman gets out in the daytime!

430
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,009
And I’ll tell you why—privately—I’ve
seen her!

431
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,308
I can see her out of every one of my windows!

432
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:53,999
It is the same woman, I know, for she is always
creeping, and most women do not creep by daylight.

433
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,369
I see her on that long shaded lane, creeping
up and down.

434
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,499
I see her in those dark grape arbors, creeping
all around the garden.

435
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,849
I see her on that long road under the trees,
creeping along, and when a carriage comes

436
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,959
she hides under the blackberry vines.

437
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,369
I don’t blame her a bit.

438
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,119
It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping
by daylight!

439
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,028
I always lock the door when I creep by daylight.

440
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:18,739
I can’t do it at night, for I know John
would suspect something at once.

441
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,509
And John is so queer now, that I don’t want
to irritate him.

442
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,969
I wish he would take another room!

443
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,509
Besides, I don’t want anybody to get that
woman out at night but myself.

444
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,908
I often wonder if I could see her out of all
the windows at once.

445
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:35,139
But, turn as fast as I can, I can only see
out of one at one time.

446
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,579
And though I always see her she may be able
to creep faster than I can turn!

447
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,969
I have watched her sometimes away off in the
open country, creeping as fast as a cloud

448
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,398
shadow in a high wind.

449
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,398
## ---

450
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:51,589
If only that top pattern could be gotten off
from the under one!

451
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,929
I mean to try it, little by little.

452
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,889
I have found out another funny thing, but
I shan’t tell it this time!

453
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,489
It does not do to trust people too much.

454
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,099
There are only two more days to get this paper
off, and I believe John is beginning to notice.

455
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,439
I don’t like the look in his eyes.

456
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,709
And I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional
questions about me.

457
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,579
She had a very good report to give.

458
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,859
She said I slept a good deal in the daytime.

459
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,949
John knows I don’t sleep very well at night,
for all I’m so quiet!

460
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,158
He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and
pretended to be very loving and kind.

461
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,749
As if I couldn’t see through him!

462
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,199
Still, I don’t wonder he acts so, sleeping
under this paper for three months.

463
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,339
It only interests me, but I feel sure John
and Jennie are secretly affected by it.

464
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,339
## ---

465
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,339
Hurrah!

466
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,639
This is the last day, but it is enough.

467
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,849
John is to stay in town over night, and won’t
be out until this evening.

468
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,219
Jennie wanted to sleep with me—the sly thing!
but I told her I should undoubtedly rest better

469
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,069
for a night all alone.

470
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,678
That was clever, for really I wasn’t alone
a bit!

471
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,119
As soon as it was moonlight, and that poor
thing began to crawl and shake the pattern,

472
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,849
I got up and ran to help her.

473
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,489
I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled,
and before morning we had peeled off yards

474
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,489
of that paper.

475
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,499
A strip about as high as my head and half
around the room.

476
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,609
And then when the sun came and that awful
pattern began to laugh at me I declared I

477
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,229
would finish it to-day!

478
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,928
We go away to-morrow, and they are moving
all my furniture down again to leave things

479
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:17,099
as they were before.

480
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,609
Jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but
I told her merrily that I did it out of pure

481
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,239
spite at the vicious thing.

482
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,659
She laughed and said she wouldn’t mind doing
it herself, but I must not get tired.

483
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,639
How she betrayed herself that time!

484
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,729
But I am here, and no person touches this
paper but me—not alive!

485
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,298
She tried to get me out of the room—it was
too patent!

486
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:39,439
But I said it was so quiet and empty and clean
now that I believed I would lie down again

487
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,319
and sleep all I could; and not to wake me
even for dinner—I would call when I woke.

488
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,939
So now she is gone, and the servants are gone,
and the things are gone, and there is nothing

489
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,199
left but that great bedstead nailed down,
with the canvas mattress we found on it.

490
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,079
We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take
the boat home to-morrow.

491
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,178
I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.

492
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:01,679
How those children did tear about here!

493
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,558
This bedstead is fairly gnawed!

494
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,599
But I must get to work.

495
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,548
I have locked the door and thrown the key
down into the front path.

496
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:12,799
I don’t want to go out, and I don’t want
to have anybody come in, till John comes.

497
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,288
I want to astonish him.

498
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:16,788
I’ve got a rope up here that even Jennie
did not find.

499
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:20,798
If that woman does get out, and tries to get
away, I can tie her!

500
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,399
But I forgot I could not reach far without
anything to stand on!

501
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,299
This bed will not move!

502
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,048
I tried to lift and push it until I was lame,
and then I got so angry I bit off a little

503
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,909
piece at one corner—but it hurt my teeth.

504
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,619
Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach
standing on the floor.

505
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,719
It sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys
it!

506
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,329
All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes
and waddling fungus growths just shriek with

507
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,329
derision!

508
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,168
I am getting angry enough to do something
desperate.

509
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:51,308
To jump out of the window would be admirable
exercise, but the bars are too strong even

510
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:52,629
to try.

511
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,699
Besides I wouldn’t do it.

512
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,699
Of course not.

513
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,849
I know well enough that a step like that is
improper and might be misconstrued.

514
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,939
I don’t like to look out of the windows
even—there are so many of those creeping

515
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,219
women, and they creep so fast.

516
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,369
I wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper
as I did?

517
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,009
But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden
rope—you don’t get me out in the road

518
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,009
there!

519
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,298
I suppose I shall have to get back behind
the pattern when it comes night, and that

520
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,298
is hard!

521
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:25,928
It is so pleasant to be out in this great
room and creep around as I please!

522
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:27,428
I don’t want to go outside.

523
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,709
I won’t, even if Jennie asks me to.

524
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,538
For outside you have to creep on the ground,
and everything is green instead of yellow.

525
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:39,589
But here I can creep smoothly on the floor,
and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch

526
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,658
around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.

527
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,309
Why, there’s John at the door!

528
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,319
It is no use, young man, you can’t open
it!

529
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,249
How he does call and pound!

530
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,859
Now he’s crying for an axe.

531
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,339
It would be a shame to break down that beautiful
door!

532
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,860
“John dear!” said I in the gentlest voice,
“the key is down by the front steps, under

533
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:00,189
a plantain leaf!”

534
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,199
That silenced him for a few moments.

535
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,849
Then he said—very quietly indeed, “Open
the door, my darling!”

536
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,269
“I can’t,” said I.

537
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,519
“The key is down by the front door under
a plantain leaf!”

538
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,099
And then I said it again, several times, very
gently and slowly, and said it so often that

539
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,119
he had to go and see, and he got it, of course,
and came in.

540
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,369
He stopped short by the door.

541
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,808
“What is the matter?” he cried.

542
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,989
“For God’s sake, what are you doing!”

543
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,209
I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked
at him over my shoulder.

544
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,668
“I’ve got out at last,” said I, “in
spite of you and Jennie!

545
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:35,398
And I’ve pulled off most of the paper, so
you can’t put me back!”

546
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,569
Now why should that man have fainted?

547
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:43,919
But he did, and right across my path by the
wall, so that I had to creep over him every

548
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,039
time!
