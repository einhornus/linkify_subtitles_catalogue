00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,179
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,139
Yessssssss!      *happy laughter*

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,199
*footsteps*

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,799
*wind*

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,519
*CLUNK*

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,939
Right now I am in San Jose on a big summer work trip.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,719
And I've got 10 days to get to Moab, Utah

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,219
and then BACK down to L.A.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,519
With this much distance and that little time,

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,579
I was gonna fly.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,379
But then, someone I know said,

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,939
"You should take this Tesla."

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,399
♫ angelic choir ♫

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,639
They said to me,

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,819
I couldn't say no.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,479
IT'S TIME FOR A ROAD TRIP!

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,319
Oh, sooooo cool!

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,959
That is never gonna get old!

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,479
Ohmigod, I can't believe this.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,699
I am so nervous and so excited right now.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,379
I have no words for this,

22
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,439
Like I can't even explain anything I just have to get started!!

23
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,499
....and we're just, we're just going to go... that's what's going to happen here.

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,459
*clicking of the turn indicator thingy*

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,139
FFFFFaaaa! F*ckin hell

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,619
Future Grey here editing this video: "Now past Grey is very excited, but what he doesn't know...

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,279
is.....

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,799
he's going to make this trip way harder for himself than need be.

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,959
And he's also going to make some of the dumbest, most dangerous decisions he's ever made in his adult life."

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,079
But...he doesn't know that.

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,559
Now you know that.

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,099
Back to the excitement.

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:47,159
FFFFFaaaa! F*ckin' hell

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,599
obviously it should...

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,619
but it's still quiet relieving to know...

36
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,899
*blinker*blinker*blinker*

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,479
Awwwww God...that's amazing....

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,839
*blinker*blinker*

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,319
*deep breath*

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,439
WHOOOOOOO maaaaaan....

41
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,419
*exhilarated exhale*

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,619
*happy sigh* Alright.

43
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,339
Alright.

44
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,478
*still high on the excitement sigh*  
 Ohmygod.

45
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,679
This was REALLY overwhelming....ummm.... and I've spent all my adrenaline....

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,119
...and I need to calm down and eat a sandwich.

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,059
I haven't done any significant driving for....

48
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,459
nearly a decade.

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,279
On the last road trip that I took....

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,499
it ended in a.....pretty.....bad accident....

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,419
Everyone walked away...

52
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,759
but after that, I just didn't want to drive, so.....

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,739
I hardly ever did it....

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,139
...which meant I was a nervous wreck everytime I did....

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,179
which made me drive even less....

56
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,119
and then....because I live in a big city I didn't need to drive.

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,299
But I'm going to use this opportunity.... to start again.

58
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,719
*shakey voice* I'm nervous, *with more confidence*  but so far, the Tesla's made it a lot easier for me

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,239
...and....

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,539
BOY have I missed driving.

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,499
Just coming back from the store and oooooh mmmy god is it beautiful.

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,619
Blue's not my color but that car looks fantastic.

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,599
*door slams*

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,939
Now that I've done the first leg on the highway...

65
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,079
aahhh..... What is it car??

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,519
Oh. My seatbelt.

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,699
*click keys in ignition*

68
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,419
Now that I've done the first leg....

69
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,879
and I haven't died.

70
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,439
aahhhhh.....

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,559
*chuckle with glee* It's FANTASTIC. It's an AMAZING car.

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,099
aahhhh...but now I'm going to spend a little bit.... in a more focused frame of mind...

73
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,819
playing around with like all of the settings on the screen and figuring out a few things.....

74
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:36,459
before I.... continue onward with the next leg of this drive.

75
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,199
*blinker*blinker*blinker*

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,819
This has been a real moment in my life and....

77
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,939
just.... a fantastic driving experience...

78
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,839
...but...

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,499
I noticed that the click and the animation of the click of the car.....

80
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,159
are not synchronized.

81
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,039
So.....

82
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,359
One star. Literally unusable.

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,859
*blinker*blinker*blinker*

84
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,199
I've made it to the first super charger location with *soft chuckle* fourty-five miles left on the battery....

85
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,059
which is waaaaaaayyyyyyy closer than I would ever cut it with a gas tank.

86
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,819
uhhhhh, I have some real range anxiety with cars,

87
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,619
but, uhhhh, I thought I would just...trust the map and what it's telling me....

88
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,079
And so here I am. Waiting on line for the next super charger slot that's available.

89
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,639
Ok, so.....if this is the charger.....

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,659
Oh that's so cool......

91
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,159
Aaannnddd....

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,619
*click*

93
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,239
Pullin in 104....103 kilowatts....which is crazy

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,319
uhhhh, and I need to leave it here for about 40 minutes

95
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,399
before I continue on the next leg of the trip...

96
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,659
...which is PERFECT because this is in a little mall area and I've got some errands I need to run.

97
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,239
Ok. Back from errands...

98
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,899
and there's a hat trick of X's....

99
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,519
It....looks like we're pretty set...

100
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,239
...to continue on the road! *sigh*

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,379
OHMYGOD *with glee in the voice*  I can't believe how exciting this is!!!!

102
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,859
Forgot about this. Turns out the car won't let you drive...

103
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,739
If you're still plugged in....

104
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,399
Ahhhhhhhhhh, so I'm guessing....stop charging???

105
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,739
*wind blowing loudly* Come on...oh I'm still connected, oh and it closed for me!

106
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,059
*uncontainable glee* This car is goddammed MAGIC!

107
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,439
Alright. Calm down Grey. Calm down.

108
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,519
It's very exciting. *to himself* Calm down.

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,379
Oh yeah, the door closes when I sit.

110
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,619
Ok. Ok.

111
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,999

♫ Ukiyo - Kaleidoscope ♫

113
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,479
One of the great things about doing a road trip in America is all of these little rest stops that exist

114
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,179
where you can just pull over and take a break. Go to the bathroom maybe get a snack.

115
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,399
It's really nice.

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,319
Oh. And by the way.

117
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:18,819
Beware of snakes.

118
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,659
I look forward to our trip together.

♫ Ukiyo - Kaleidoscope ♫

120
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:46,879
We're up high enough that there's snow on the ground!

121
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:56,099
This is unbelievable. I'm...I'm not sure it looks up the way on the camera....but HOLY hell is the visibility low.

122
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,939
It's like...it is a gas station in the corner???

123
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,199
I feel like I'm in the mist....

124
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,639
*excitedly* Look at this! It's AMAZING!

125
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,179
So I'm totally unprepared for this weather....

126
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,139
Ahhhhh, this hoodie is very warm but its not....

127
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,999
...snow warm.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,459
but I'm taking a little break here because the visibility was just zero on the freeway and....

129
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:27,699
it NEVER snows in London!!!! And I've like...I've gone... all year without seeing ANY snow and I'm so just sooo....

130
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,339
excited right now!!

131
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,759
and happy!

132
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,279
and very cold....

133
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,359
And I just wanted to walk over....

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,959
*sigh* and see....

135
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,739
what this little thing was in the snow.

136
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,279
*deep exhale*

137
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,559
Beautiful BEAUTIFUL snow!

138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,159
Look at those trucks in the snow and the forest in the background....

139
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,099
It's just BEAUTIFUL!

140
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,379
Ok, it is beautiful, but......

141
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,899
I'm also FREEZING.

142
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,379
Okay I've realized it's actually going to get pretty dark....

143
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,339
soon.

144
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,759
and..... I'm at the...*coffee pouring*...I'm at like 5,000 feet.

145
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,079
I think the only way.....

146
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,519
...out of this is through the snow and I want to do it before it gets dark.

147
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,759
So i'm going to load up on some rest stop coffee and then we're going to get going.

148
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,579
You're all strapped in the back seat...stay cozy.

149

*soft chuckle* I didn't realize....

153
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,119
....the road I was driving over is the Donner Pass.

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,459

the LUCKIEST man alive right now.

156
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:34,739
I bumped into a guy who's flying a drone....and now I REALLY feel like I need a drone.

Well.

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,619
This has been quiet the first day back of driving.

159
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,439

Alright. I was planning to go farther today but....

165
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:09,899
....the ahh snow in the Donner Pass...that took awhile and it took a lot out of me...so I'm going to do the smart thing,

166
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,599
and...I'm not gonna to push....further

167
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,819
*click*....*to himself* did that lock in?? And I'm going to get....there we go.

168
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,419

Very Christmasy. Feels appropriate.

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:49,559
This was a good decision....ahhh. The instant I stopped driving, I realized I am tireder than.....I thought I was.

174
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,779
So...I am very glad to be getting into a room.

175
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,219
To be able to spend the night....and relax.

176
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,559
WOOO! A desk!

177
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,679
Alright.

178
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,779
Time to set up a work station and pull all the footage off those cards and see what I was actually able to keep in the end.

179
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:15,779
*click*

180
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:46,479
Speaking of cold....

181
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,939
*click*

182
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,739
It's charging at 3 miles per hour. We've added 22 miles overnight.

183
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,799
This is really good!! Because this means I can possibly....try....

184
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,679
something that I was thinking about last night.

185
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,299
Now. To get to Moab. Here's what I should do....

186
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,339
I should take Interstate 80...up to Salt Lake City....that's the smart route.

187
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,399
It's filled with these. Super Chargers.

188
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,799
If you're driving a Tesla a really long way, these things charge it up really fast.

189
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,899
The only thing is...I've already driven across this road. So I have an idea for a different route.

190
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,359
A more interesting ride that I've never done is....this way.

191
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,959
Across what's known as....

192
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,579
for good reason. There's NOTHING out there. Including Super Chargers.

193
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,819
This distance is WAY to long for a Tesla to do on a single charge...BUT...

194
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:46,559
I've discovered these things....RV parks. It'll charge a lot slower than a Super Charger but it'll work.

195
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,499
There's an RV park here at Fox Peak Station and an RV park here at Ely.

196
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,379
This distance is 283 miles....

197
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,759
and a Tesla's maximum range......

198
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,819
is 300 miles.

199
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,459
If I get stranded along this road it's going to be a real problem.

200
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,339
So...into order to make this work....Fox Peak equals 100% charge.

201
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,539
I CAN NOT leave Fox Peak with less than a completely full battery otherwise I might not make it

202
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,919
and there is NOTHING out here.

203
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,219
So that's the plan.

204
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:26,079
It's 6:30 in the morning. I'm happy to have woken up and and get started early...because today might be the longest day of driving

205
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,839
but of course before we can get started....

206
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,899
Navigate to the nearest Starbucks.

207
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:41,439
There's nothing cozier than being in a snowy world...in a warm car....on your way to get some coffee.

208
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,639
Grey: Sounds like a coffee emergency...whatever that was. Barista: Uh-huh

209
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,219
I was talking to the Barista at Starbucks...and she said.....

210
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:57,199
that this kind of snow...in June...is something she's only seen four times in the 20 years she's lived here...so...

211
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:19,519
I was feeling like the luckiest man alive yesterday...and now I feel just twice as lucky that I... get to see this.

212
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,699
Whew!!! It's still pretty coooold out here!

213
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,479
Alright. Let's go inside this casino.

214
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,579
♪ casino music plays ♪

215
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:42,319

♪ casino arcade music ♪

218
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,019
It's a buffet...REIMAGINED!

219
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,059
Uh, yeah. I'm going to need two. Uh, both with bacon, egg and cheese...

220
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,819
I don't know why I said egg. Of course there's egg in it...yeah...bacon and cheese...yeah

221
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,719
Omelet Chef: Bacon & cheese? Dos? Grey: *chuckle*...Two please.

222
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,659
Hahaha....I'm not really two people though... am I?

223
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,539
Second coffee acquired....because we all now the first coffee is a warm up...

224

And.... now we're on to...Fallon....

225
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,039
This place is the test where we find out if I can do the route I want...or not.

226
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,099
Uh, oh, Fox Peak! Not Pizza Hut.

227
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,419
Fox Peak Station.

228
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,459
This is the moment of truth.

229
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,939
Leeeet's seeee what we have here....

230
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,239
*wind blowing*

231
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,239
Seeing that this part doesn't go into that part....and I have no other adapters that can bridge the gap..

232
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,119
*confusion abounds*

233
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,419
Come on baby, come on baby, alright you're going to go in there....YES!

234
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,219
Need my credit card for like the 70th time. Authorizing.....authorizing.....

235
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,319
HEEEY!!!! Alright.

236
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,699
Oh my god. It's a miracle.

237
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,159
Oh. It's going to take a long time.

238
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,839
Sitting here with the Tesla getting it charged for the next leg of the journey...

239
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,319
Ahhhh, it's a little pooped.....I'm a little pooped.

240
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,759
I'm also a bit coffeed out...so I'm going to....get some of my.... replacement coffee pills....

241
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,179
Ahhhh, which are nice....and.....have some of that....

242
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,199
And then I think....I'll show you...

243
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,539
While I wait...

244
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,179
A couple of the features of this Tesla....

245
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,859
*jet noise, you can see the plane as a speck in the distance* Fighter Jets from the Air Force Base.....soooooooo loud!

246
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,819
Alright, the number one thing I worried about before driving the Tesla was thisa GINORMOUS screen and how distracting it would be...

247
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,539
I mean...it is HUGE!

248
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:50,339
But it handles really well...so when you when you hit the navigation, right, so I'm going to navigate...that I want to get to Ely, Nevada.

249
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,219
What it will do....and it would fill in if we had any kind of internet connection...

250
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:01,279
it'll show an overview of your route if you want...or it'll show a particular leg...like to the next Super Charger....

251
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,118
But it doesn't actually really tell you how to really drive here.....

252
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,979
THAT.... is through the steering wheel...on this little screen.

253
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,719
So you don't have to be looking like at this gigantic screen over here....to see where you're supposed to turn,

254
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,939
instead the turn by turn directions are right here....and when you're driving

255
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:27,699
it's exactly in your field of view...like I feel this is precisely where I want to be looking to see the turn by turn directions.

256
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,239
So THUMBS UP for that.

257
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,779
There is a bunch of other stuff you can do with the screen, but what I like is...

258
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,979
the rear view mirror doesn't give you a huge field of view here...but it doesn't matter...

259
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,619
because, here...there's a button for the camera. So you can hit a rear view camera....

260
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,099
and that shows you what's behind the car.

261
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,799
And then, you can take these two windows and say,  swap them....

262
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,059
So that...your overview of your trip is up here. Your rear view mirror is here and you can even

263
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,939
full screen this a little bit more...so it's as big as it can possibly be.

264
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,119
And I like this set up for driving.

265
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,179
Ok. Let's take a look at the car.

266
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,299
Ahhh, you have this little magic key fob and when you get close, the car recognizes you're coming by...

267
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,699
so it starts turning on...the mirror folds out...you can press the door....

268
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,019
and the door opens up automatically which is super nice!

269
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,619
A thing that I thought was a total gimmick...but I love it!

270
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,779
Is when you get in the car....when you press...the break...

271
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,819
the side door closes automatically.

272
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:38,999
This wire though connects back....to there's a little, uhh, nice dash space where you can plug in...

273
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,539
a traditional cigarette lighter that also has two USB A ports which is charging my laptop

274
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,499
actually from the battery of the car....and another wire which is going up to....

275
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,299
the dash cam that I have set up so that you can see what's going on on this road trip.

276
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,819
From inside the car...ahh, you can actually control the doors as well....

277
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,759
so you can say that you want the driver door open.....and the passenger door open...

278
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,299
and they'll just go!

279
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,219
Alright, lets get out to watch the impressive thing that everybody likes....

280
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,559
Which is the amazing "falcon wing" doors on this thing.

281
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,999
Apparently, in the settings they have some auto height features

282
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,779
that will open up higher or lower based on the space that you're in.

283
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,019
The trunk of the car also goes up...

284
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,259
These are all of the wires and adapters I was messing around with before to actually charge the Tesla.

285
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,779
They come in this nice little....case.

286
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,259
Obviously on this road trip I'm not carrying around...

287
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,099
One, two, three, four, five, six...seven people....

288
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,099
so instead I have these seats go flat.

289
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,679
There's a little button on the top here you press...when you press it....

290
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,639
The head pops down....

291
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,959
you can then....fold the whole thing flat.

292
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,599
So it gives you just a TON of space.

293
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,239
That's the trunk...let's go, let's go around to the fronk.

294
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,479
*wind blows* We can take a look at the engine inside....

295
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,959
It's pretty awesome.

296
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,079
No engine of course....because this is a Tesla!

297
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,059
So we don't need all that disgusting, fluidly, enginey stuff...

298
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,559
that like your grandpa knows how to fix, but you don't really care about.

299
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,939
There's nothing in here!

300
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,259
The whole car is really just the wheel base...the other wheel base...

301
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,859
and a biiiig battery that connects the two of them with some electrical engines that spin both of the wheels,

302
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,899
but everything above that is just CAR....

303
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,239
So now with all that space you may be asking yourself...."Grey????

304
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,139
I...I haven't seen any suitcases...on this trip...

305
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,819
I haven't seen any luggage. You know the kind of stuff that you'd need for a big ole' road trip."

306
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,979
Like...this car is prrreetttyy empty.

307
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,359
Because there's no traditional car stuff taking all the space...there's space everywhere....

308
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,479
including....right here in the back...

309
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,959
there's a panel...that you can pull up..and HERE is where I've actually hidden...

310
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,579
all of the stuff that I've packed. I like it to look like I'm not carrying all my possessions in the car....

311
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,859
The only other thing than....are these cup holders.

312
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,799
I don’t know if it’s the way I fit in a car or…what…

313
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,999
but this cup holders is impossible for me to reach. I have to move my arm.....

314
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,739
ALLLLL the way back behind the seat.

315
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,459
To then move it forward....to be able to get the drink...and up.

316
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,439
Like my elbow naturally goes exactly where this cup holder is.

317
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,559
There should be a cup holder here....

318
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,819
Or there should be a cup holder here...

319
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,919
but this spot. Ruuugh...Ughhh....Aughhh

320
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,759
That spot is....is no bueno for a cup holder.

321
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,539
*wind blowing* Alright that's everything it's time to pack it up and figure out what we're doing.

322
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:49,979
*wind blowing*

323
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,679
Ok, I think I've been sitting here long enough.

324
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,619
Now, I know past me said something like....

325
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,739
"I... can NOT leave Fox Peak with less than a completely full battery."

326
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,319
But you know what? I'm not obligated to that guy. He's not here right now.

327
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,379
I have discovered something. I don't need to go to Ely....

328
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,619
I can go to a place called Austin...in the middle.

329
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:14,619
There's an RV park in Austin, that if I can get there...they have a 50 AMP....charger.

330
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,379
Now....

331
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,639
Hopefully I have the right accessories to be able to make that work....

332
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,079
But I have a 20% margin of error to make it to Austin to be able to charge....

333
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,119
and I'm in a dice rollin' kinda mood!

334
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,519
*said with lots of passion* I didn't come across the god-damn ocean to drive across a road I've already driven!

335
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,059
Or to sit at a gas station for another 3 hours!

336
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:39,139
It's time to get out of here and go get possibly stranded in the desert.

337
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,499
Death, is always the worst that can happen.

338
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,559
Ok, I actually spent the next 15 minutes finding every single setting in the Settings Panel that I could....

339
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,779
flip.... to make energy savings the maximum amount possible....

340
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,459
and get the cabin pre-cooled to save energy on air conditioning as well....

341
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,859
so I didn’t just bolt out of here....I spent a long of time being fussy about things.

342
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,899
BUT NOW  IT'S TIME TO GO!!

343
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,159
Alright we're on the road.

344
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,019
There's a bunch of stuff that I can possibly do to extend the range just a little bit....

345
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,439
and..... so far so good! We're up 1%!

346
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,339
I'm sure that'll ah read 100 by the time we get there if...ah...trends continue.

347
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,199
So I'm feeling pretty great!

348
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,559
Here we are together on the 'Loneliest Road in America'.

349
00:23:21,560 --> 00:24:17,119
♫ Zeta - Bina 49 ♫

350
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,899
We're about halfway to Austin….which is about halfway along my journey of this section of the loneliest road.

351
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:30,699
We're estimating at about 16%...upon arrival in Austin...which is pretty good.

352
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,039
I think this was a good decision.

353
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,319
I think we’re gonna make it.

354
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,759
Bailey Blue just popped up this alert.

355
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,519
She’s getting concerned that we’re too far from all the Super Chargers.

356
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,179
And I don’t blame her.

357
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,299
We are smack dab in the middle of a Super Charger desert.

358
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,459
Don’t worry!

359
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,759
You got me through those mountains….I’ll get you through this desert of electricity.

360
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,039
I hope.

361
00:24:59,040 --> 00:26:07,199
♫ Zeta - RAM ♫

362
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,999
We have officially reached Austin City Limits and hoooollly hell am I relieved.

363
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,819
Heeeellllo Austin Community Services! Boy am I glad to see you.

364
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,019
Now it's time to try and find the Pony Express RV Camp.

365
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,299
To local man off camera: Pony Express? Or is that the next one down there? Local Man: Yeah, it's down there Grey: Ok, great. Thank you very much man.

366
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,459
Oh my god I'm so excited to be here!!

367
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,499
*wind blowing* *Grey grunts*

368
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,079
Gold Mine!

369
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,059
That....is what I'm looking for.

370
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,779
50 AMP......deliciousness.

371
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,699
*click*

372
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,779
This is the moment of truth really…

373
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,839
Ahhhhh….because if this doesn’t work… * nervous chuckle*

374
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,639
I am kind of f*cked.

375
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,559
Alright...you and you should go together....

376
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,579
*click*

377
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,539
*diesel truck running* Let's....flip!

378
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,539
Ok......

379
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,179
Oooohhh, that looks sketchy.....

380
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,559
*wind blowing* *shoes crunching on gravel*

381
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,479
AWESOME. Ok. Fantastic.

382
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,459
We’ve at least got electricity.

383
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,199
We’ve got 40 AMPS

384
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,079
*HUGE sigh of relief*

385
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,399
So now I guess the question is to see if I can find...a hotel where I can stay....

386
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,299
and....

387
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,579
there's one possibility here.

388
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,079
Which is...

389
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,579
There's a hotel up the road...

390
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,879
I've got some keys...and a toasty warm room...which I am super happy to have.

391
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,419
I am ridiculously unprepared for this weather.

392
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,439
I thought I was....driving in to the desert!

393
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,959
Oh *sigh* my god, so warm!

394
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,999
*happy shiver of warmth and glee*

395
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,639
Thank you heater!

396
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,979
Thank you door!

397
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,219
Thank you desk!

398
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,699
Thank you microwave!

399
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,939
I am SO glad to be in this room.

400
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,859
So, I realized yesterday that I have dramatically underestimated

401
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,799
how much storage space I was going to need running all of these cameras.

402
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,679
Of course right now I have files that exist only on the 'dashcam' cams and that's just one copy.

403
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,219
So I have to get two copies.

404
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:23,659
*hints of Grey's voice in post-production editing software or Incoherent technobabble in the editing room*

405
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,519
*keys rattling and rattling*

406
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:33,459
*Klunk*

407
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,139
*Keys dropping into box*

408
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,679
Ugh, I need some coffee.

409
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,599
*sound of footsteps on wooden deck*

410
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,839
*clank of bell on door*

411
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,339
Hello?

412
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,579
Hello?

413
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,619
Uuhh... OK.

414
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,819
After a night on the charger, we're all set.

415
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,239
Go substitute coffee, go!

416
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,619
I need you.

417
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,779
Great.

418
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,759
Thank you, town of Austin!

419
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,479
Now it's on to Ely.

420
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,419
Supercharger desert.

421
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,599
And there's more..... to go.

422
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,519
I normally wear contacts when I'm driving but, my eyes are bothering me so I'm back...

423
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,119
to my glasses.

424
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,659
But it is a 'driving into the sun' morning,

425
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,959
so I'm gonna be pulling the super-cool look....

426
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,499
*clank*

427
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,619
of shades *chuckle* on top of prescription glasses.

428
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:48,739
I have never been I think...on a longer more isolated road...than this.

429
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:55,239
I was worried about taking the Tesla where no Tesla is supposed to be...but...

430
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:13,099
this is a lifetime experience.

431
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,679
First real coffee of the day acquired. *sigh of contentment*

432
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,379
At a lovely little cafe in Eureka. Man, I wish I had more time to explore this town.

433
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,419
I'm gonna be late enough for Moab as it is...so I gotta get going.

434
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,939
And the danger of stopping anywhere with a beautiful Bailey Blue Tesla...

435
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,359
*with a smile in his voice* is that everybody wants to talk about it.

436
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,159
So expect...Tesla conversation related delays wherever you go.

437
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,239
Now we just need to find a place....

438
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,139
to hook up...and pay.

439
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,979
Awww, sweet!

440
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,239
Man. That NEVER gets old.

441
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,139
Ok. The nice woman and the casino set me up with a license to park

442
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,259
and a place to work in the hotel with internet.

443
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,919
Internets are few and far between here and I need to download some work files.

444
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,579
If you listen to my Podcast, you'll know I like to use code names for my projects.

445
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,699
So this little statue is calling to me….

446
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,679
If you're ever on the Loneliest Road...

447
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,699
come see the bear.

448
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,759
The first.

449
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,959
Grey Point.

450
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,719
And I wish I had more time to explore the town because it looks like there's a ton of interesting stuff here...

451
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,079
but once again, if I'm gonna get to Moab on time, I really need to get going.

452
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,939
Oh helloooo, hello!

453
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,099
Oh my gaw hellooo!

454
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,259
Faint voice in the background: Oh my goodness, somebody to talk to, somebody new!

455
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,219
Grey: What's her name?

456
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,479
Puppy owner: Her name is Tinkerbell.

457
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,039
Oh, hello Tinkerbell!

458
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,899
This. Never gets old....is you press the button...

459
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,799
Click.

460
00:31:47,800 --> 00:32:15,819
The whole thing. *the crowd ooohs and aaahs*

461
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,619
We've made it to Deseret.

462
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,019
That didn't take long for Deseret to start looking like Deseret. *ha.ha*

463
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:31,099
If you do drive.... in the west, make sure to get red tinted sunglasses... it makes the whole experience better.

464
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,879
Not that this isn't beautiful....

465
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,419
but upping the saturation sure doesn't hurt.

466
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,719
We're coming up on the town of Delta.

467
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:46,679
Which should have....the last RV park for the Loneliest Road section of this trip.

468
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,059
I see RV's oh ho oh ho!!

469
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,579
Man. This is the nicest looking RV park I've seen yet!

470
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,659
Proper Spaces.

471
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,439
Grass.

472
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,239
Let's just see...do they have....

473
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,519
what I need...

474
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,939
Oh. F......ck.

475
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:16,999
*angry crunching of grass under feet*

476
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,939
Double F@ck.

477
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,639
Alright. Moment of truth.

478
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,919
YYYES!!!

479
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,199
*click*

480
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,799
Flip the switch.

481
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,719
Greengreengreengreen. YES!!

482
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,059
Alright!!!! Fan....tastic.

483
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,379
Bailey Blue isn’t the only one that needs some power….

484
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,879
it’s dinnertime.

485
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,659
*birds chirping* *Grey crunching*

486
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,879
So an interesting thing has happened.

487
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,719
Now that I'm here....

488
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,279
there's a Super Charger up here....

489
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,339
in Nephi, Utah, that I’ve never...noticed before or I swear to God is brand new.

490
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,899
Ah, It wasn't there when I was looking at the route a couple days ago.

491
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,119
I was thinking I needed to go to Super Charger down here.

492
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,119
Which would have been waaay out of the way.

493
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,539
But this one says I can make it there with 8% remaining.

494
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,919
Given ALL of this, it means....that...

495
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,979
since I have reached the edge of the Loneliest Road in America

496
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,559
and I am off...the Super Charger desert...

497
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,799
I can make it to a Super Charger and I can make it to Moab....TONIGHT.

498
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,439
Every gamble on this trip so far has worked out amazingly so I'm going to roll the dice one last time.

499
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,559
Day light’s burning we’ve got to roll.

500
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,178
Thank you Antelope RV Park in Delta!

501
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,138
YOU are the reason I might make it to Moab tonight.

502
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:47,619
Alright. I gotta put down the camera. We gotta go.

503
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,658
*blinker*blinker*

504
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,999
Whewww 28 miles to spare.

505
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,279
*click*

506
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,839
Looks like we're topping out at around 270 MPH that we sit at the charger.

507
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,499
Super Chargers I feel like I really appreciate you after the Loneliest Road.

508
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,959
It was too easy at the beginning, but now I understand just how great you are.

509
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,679
It's going to be 50 minutes here before we can move on to Green River.

510
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,019
I gotta say I'm feeling pretty great just to be back on the Super Charger network.

511
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:22,379
I feel like that's already...quiet an accomplishment.

512
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,599
So I don't know....

513
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:32,139
Maybe I'll charge up and.....

514
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,959
Oooo! It's a truck train.

515
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,339
The sun's going down....but you know what??

516
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,019
I don't want to be showing up late tomorrow....I'd rather get there tonight.

517
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,199
Time for....

518
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,239
Tesla. After Dark.

519
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,719
Let's do this!

520
00:35:48,720 --> 00:36:55,399
♫ RoccoW - Bleeps Galore ♫

521
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,599
So I made a bad assumption that there were going to be lights all over this highway....

522
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,959
And...there are not.

523
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,899
I think I would have not done this...

524
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,999
if I had realized it was going to be in total darkness for 100 miles.

525
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,239
Ummmm...

526
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,719
83 miles to go! *sigh*

527
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,679
Hoooooly f#ck am I....

528
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,859
*incredulous chuckle*

529
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,479
Am I glad to be off that highway.

530
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,039
*Deep sigh of relief* Alright. *door close*

531
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,219
I thought the most stressful driving was going to be that snow, but boy was I wrong.

532
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,639
I am. I am literally....

533
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,139
I am literally shaking.

534
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,399
Just 20 minutes to kill...while she's charging....

535
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,679
Ok. I'm full of, I'm full of adrenaline and nerves.

536
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,459
I'm just going to walk around for a minute and shake it off.

537
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,419
Let guess, this is the eponymous Green River.

538
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,719
*door click* Alright, let's get back inside here.

539
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,899
*SIGH*

540
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:59,119
Thank you, John Wesley Powell History Museum for installing those Tesla chargers.

541
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:07,779
Alright. Just a tiny bit longer until Moab and we're done for the night.

542
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,519
NOPE.

543
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,659
I’m going to stop it here.

544
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,319
I can’t show you anymore fast forwarded footage with fun music underneath it.

545
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,479
This was a DUMB, dangerous decision at the end of a long series of dumb, dangerous decisions.

546
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,379
I'd been driving since AUSTIN.

547
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,339
I should have stopped at the RV park...

548
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,079
I should have stopped at the Super Charger...

549
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,199
I DEFINITELY should have stopped at Green River....

550
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,979
but I didn't.

551
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,739
This is how catastrophic errors happen and I just got reallly lucky.

552
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,539
I will NEVER do this again.

553
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,899
PLEASE. Go. To. Bed. if you're driving.

554
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,339
NOTHING is that important.

555
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:47,399
So I'm going to skip past all this now.

556
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:57,439
*Good Morning*

557
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,919
*gravel crunching under shoes*

558
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,539
You

559
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,399
ARG...it's hard to get that spot isn't it....

560
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,499
Good boy.

561
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:15,139
Alright, I'll be back later.

562
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:27,279
*wind blowing*

563
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,359
Ok, so while I was out here.

564
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,659
Tesla literally announced the next version of their Auto-Pilot System with a ton of improvements...

565
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,859
including more sensors, on ramp/off ramp ability...

566
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,639
Ummm, better ability to hold tight the lanes and take turns...

567
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,499
and smart summon and....a whole bunch of other stuff.

568
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,239
This is one of the things I love about technology.

569
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,359
because technology involves the promise of constant iteration and improvement.

570
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,659
And it is the reason why I have just NEVER cared about cars AT ALL

571
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,459
but I've been really interested in Tesla since I first heard about them because

572
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,759
it seems to me much less a car than a....

*more walking and footsteps*

577
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,039
This ceiling is REALLY low I can't actually...

578
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,699
I can't actually stand up in this place.

579
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,379
Oh God....

580
00:41:53,380 --> 00:42:02,279
Oh yeah...that's not...that's not creepy at all!!

581
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,419
Oh God.....

Yeah....

585

Watch the hell out for that...

586
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,179
What makes this 10 times creepier is that this certainly seems like a ghost town.

587
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,279
Except.

588
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,039
There are a lot of these...

589
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,199
*tap*tap*tap*

590
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,419
pretty shiny new....

591
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,159
No Trespassing signs around.

592
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,439
Like this......

593
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,539
Post Office.

594
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,419
*gravel crunching under Grey's feet*

595
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,079
Which is, I'm going to guess, actually locked.

596
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,919
Yeah, see... so that's actually locked.

597
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,619
Is this new looking sign.

598
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,719
"Smile You're on Camera"

599
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,459
A security camera that suuure looks like it's active.

600
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,019
*almost under his breath* Jesus Christ...

601
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,099
Not gonna lie...I'm kinda terrified to open this....

602
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,779
*wiggles lock as wind blows through the camera*

603
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,439
*clank*

604
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,979
*mumbles* Jesus Christ.

605
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,379
This thing looks like a puzzle out of midst.

606
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,059
Well, I do actually have to go....

607
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:34,259
Wait, don't drop your phone down the toilet this time!

608
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,299
Well, if you say so...

609
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:43,179
*flick*

610
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:43,799
*creak*

611
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,639
Well...

612
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,319
*footsteps on deck*

613
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,939
time to go now I think.

614
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,899
Cars do...

615
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:59,419
feel a bit like a bubble of security and safety that you can take with you wherever you go.

616
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,379
Annnnd....

617
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,719
I'm glad I came out to this ghost town...

618
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,539
but the feeling like there are people around is creepy as all hell.

619
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,219
So...

620
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,239
I am very happy to....

621
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,079
head back to that bubble...

622
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,399
of safety and security...

623
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,799
and get back to Moab.

624
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,199
Alright. In the car....

625
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,019
Lock the door.

626
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,919
*nervous chuckle*

627
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,139
Goodbye, Cisco.

628
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,919

629
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,839
*bird chirp*

630
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,299
I've been in Moab for a few days...

631
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,279
getting work done.

632
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,379
Getting podcast recording done.

633
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,739
*ding*dong*bing*dong*ding*dong*bing*dong*ding* *dong*ding*...*bing*

634
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,979
All of my equipment is different and new...

635
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,879
*laughter in voice* it's like, oh Jesus Christ, fingers crossed!

636
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,659
Planning and preparing for the final and hardest part of this summer

637
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,199
which is...

638
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,679
Not looking forward to that.

639
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,559
But also, when I can, taking advantage of....

640
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,879
this unique...

641
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,499
and osterley beautiful part of the country.

642
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,139
Driving through the west is like nothing else.

643
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,179
This trip has been just what I needed.

644
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,959
Driving with Bailey especially through some unexpected difficulties.

645
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,039
I've gotten over a lot of the fear and hesitation I had about driving.

646
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,319
I'm really appreciative for that.

647
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,819
This is my final day in Moab.

648
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,759
So I'm going to take the time to appreciate it to...

649
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,819
before I have to drive....

650
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:35,859
to L.A.

651
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,339
*people talking faintly in background*

652
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,459
*wind blowing*

653
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,539
Got my coffee.

654
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,459
Got my music.

655
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,279
Now just four stops left until I have to be in L.A.

656
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,279
and at vidcon. *sad voice*

657
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,759
But, no need to dwell!!

658
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,819
Moab. I'll see you again soon!

659
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:59,819
Bailey, let's enjoy the last of the desert driving.

660
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,779
This is the entrance to the San Rafael Swell.

661
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,579
Alright Bailey.

662
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,019
I know that our time together....

663
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,399
is growing short.

664
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,939
but I'm glad that I get to take you....

665
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,979
through one of my favorite sections of....

666
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,079
Interstate.

676
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,259
That is some serious solar paneling.

677
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,439
It's factorio!

678
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,899
Man....I want that upgrade!

679
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,939
It's time to be agriculturally inspected.

680
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,639
This is the last charging pit stop for Bailey.

681
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,119
Not gonna lie....I am, I am getting pretty emotional about saying goodbye to this girl.

682
00:48:52,120 --> 00:49:00,179
Feel like we've been though a lot together.

683
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,579
We've had a fun romp through the desert.

684
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,139
But I think we gotta....

685
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,079
we gotta clean you back up before you go back to your normal life.

686
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,899
'The Works" of course.

687
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,739
Only the best for Bailey.

688
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,299
I know you don't want a bath.

689
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,119
But you'll be happy to be clean....and....

690
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,279
you know you'll be....

691
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,999
you'll be glad to be back home once you're there.

692
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,619
*thunk*thunk*

693
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,659
See...doesn't that feel good??

694
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:30,259
*car washing noises*

695
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,399
Look how good you look!

696
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,699
Alright girl.

697
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,719
Let's get me to Vidcon....

698
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:40,399
and you home.

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,959
