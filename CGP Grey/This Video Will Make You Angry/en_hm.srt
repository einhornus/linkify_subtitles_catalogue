00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,119
Hello Internet.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,798
Thoughts compete for space in your brain:
cat photos, news stories, beliefs structures,

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,259
funny GIFs, educational videos, not-so-educational
videos and your thinking inventory is limited.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,559
A thought without a brain to think it, dies.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,309
Now we can treat thoughts as though they're
alive. Specifically alive like germs. That

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,288
might sound weird but stick with me.

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,088
Take jokes. Jokes are thought germs that live
in your brain -- and when you tell the joke

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,979
to another brain, you help it reproduce.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,358
Just like when you have the flu and sneeze
to help it reproduce. This germ gets into

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,929
its host by snot through the mouth and this
one by words through the ear but it's reproduction

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,939
either way.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,369
Logging on to your social media then, is exposing
yourself to everyone's mental sneezes. Each

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,398
post a glob of snot with an thought germ trying
to get in your brain -- if not for permanent

14
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,178
residence then at least long enough to get
you to press the share button and sneeze it

15
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,729
with everyone you know.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,099
In this analogy then, a funny cat photo with
a perfect caption is a super-flu.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,669
Now just as germs exploit weak points in your
immune system, so do thought germs exploit

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,069
weak points in your brain. A.K.A. emotions.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,739
Once inside, thought germs that press emotional
buttons get their hosts to spread them more

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,658
-- measurably more. Well, except sadness,
sad thought germs don't get very far. Awe

21
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,699
is pretty good which is why websites that
construct thought germs like biological weapons

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,819
arm them with them titles like "7 whatevers
that will blow your mind" or "The Shocking

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,739
Secret behind... this thing"

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,429
But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought
germ. Anger, bypasses your mental immune system,

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,328
and compels you to share it.

26
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:32,679
Being aware of your brain's weak spots is
necessary for good mental hygiene -- like

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,379
knowing how to wash your hands. Because even
without intentional construction, any thought

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,919
germ on the Internet can, on its own, grow
more infections as it spreads. To talk about

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,349
why, lets forget anger for a moment and go
back to that cat photo.

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,849
Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,
and most die a quick death like the bazillion

31
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,478
cat photos (or baby photos) posted on The
Internet that are never shared. But a mildly

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,629
funny cat photo can grow into so much more,
because just as transatlantic flights were

33
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,279
the best thing to happen to germ germs, so
the Internet is the best thing to happen to

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,059
thought germs.

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,787
For once on-board, that cat photo is a thought
germ that can leap into other brains. And

36
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,679
those brains might share it, and here's the
key point, occasionally, change it -- a Photoshop

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,628
here, a tweaked caption there.

38
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,329
Most changes are terrible, but some make the
thought germ even funnier, getting brains

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,979
to share it more. Which results in more changes
and a shot at super-stardom. A thus a lowly

40
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,318
cat photo can achieve global brain domination.
At least for a few hours.

41
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,348
The Internet, with its unparalleled ability
to share and randomly change thought germs

42
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,179
can't help but help make them stronger.

43
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,799
With jokes, that's awesome -- but with angry
germs not always so awesome. No.

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,589
Angry germs, the more they're shared undergo
the same process, changing and distorting

45
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,699
to be more aggravating. These have a better
chance of spreading than their more accurate

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,458
but more boring rivals.

47
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,649
But like plagues, thought germs can burn though
a population too quickly. Just watch your

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,119
favorite meme generating machine for a week
and you'll see the life-cycle fly by.

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,378
However some thought germs have found a way
around burnout. Now, I must warn you, depending

50
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,249
on which thought germs live in your head and
which you fight for, the next section might

51
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,189
sound *horrifying*. So please keep in mind,
we're going to talk about what makes some

52
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,378
thought germs, particularly angry ones, successful
and not how good or bad they are.

53
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,559
OK? Deep breath: calm.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,149
Though germs can burn out because once everyone
agrees, it's hard to keep talking and thus

55
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,238
thinking about them.

56
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,568
But if there's an opposing thought germ, an
argument, then the thinking never stops. Disagrement

57
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,938
doesn't have to be angry, but again, angry
helps. The more visible an argument gets the

58
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:39,268
more bystanders it draws in which makes it
more visible is why every group from the most

59
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:45,259
innocuous internet forum to The National Conversation
can turn into a double rage storm across the

60
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,768
sky in no time.

61
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,469
Wait, these though germs aren't competing,
they're co-operating. Working together they

62
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,688
reach more brains and hold their thoughts
longer than they could alone. Thought germs

63
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:58,818
on opposite sides of an argument can be symbiotic.

64
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,578
One tool symbiotic anger germs in particular
can employ is your-with-us-or-against-us.

65
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:07,328
Whatever thought germ just leaped to the front
of your brain, push it back. This video isn't

66
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:13,188
about that. We're just talking about the tool,
and this one makes it hard, for neutral brains

67
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:18,179
to resist and its diviciveness also grows
its symbiotic partner.

68
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,099
This explains why, in some arguments gaining
more allies also gains more enemies. Because

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,339
though the participants think they're involved
in a firey battle to the death from the anger

70
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,939
germs perspective one side is a field of flowers
and the other a flock of butterflies. *Of

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,339
course* planting more flowers will get you
more butterflies and getting more butterflies

72
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,259
will pollinate more flowers.

73
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,649
If there is some argument that splits the
population and lasts forever that even the

74
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,749
most neutral people find difficult to avoid,
you just might be looking at a super successful

75
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,529
pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached
ecological stability

76
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,279
Now, one final depressing though. Uhhhhâ€¦
I mean one more Awe inspiring point, that

77
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,399
will reveal the secrets of, ahhh -- actually
no it's just depressing.

78
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,699
When opposing groups get big they don't really
argue with each other, they *mostly* argue

79
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,309
with themselves about how angry the *other*
group makes them. We can actually graph fights

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,349
on the Internet to see this in action. Each
becomes its own quasi isolated internet, sharing

81
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,779
thoughts about the other.

82
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,529
You see where this is going, right?

83
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,309
Each group becomes a breeding ground for thought
germs *about* the other -- and as before the

84
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,879
most enraging -- but not necessarily the most
accurate -- spread fastest. A group almost

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,299
can't help but construct a totem of the other
so enraging they talk about it all the time

86
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,989
-- which, now that you know how though germs
grow, is exactly what make the totem always

87
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,239
perfectly maddening.

88
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,209
Now, all this isn't to say that there's no
point in arguing. (That's a different video).

89
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,739
Or that the Internet isn't amazing, or that
there aren't things worth trying to change

90
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,119
peoples' minds about. And thought germs of
all kinds come and go.

91
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,119
But it's useful to be aware of how thought
can use our emotions to spread and how the

92
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,279
more rapidly a thought is able to spread the
more chances it has to become *even better*

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,939
at spreading through random changes made to
it. Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's

94
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,749
terrible.

95
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,489
But if you want to maintain a healthy brain
it pays to be cautious of thoughts that have

96
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,309
passed through a lot of other brains and that
poke you where you are weakest.

97
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,280
It's your brain -- be hygienic with it.
