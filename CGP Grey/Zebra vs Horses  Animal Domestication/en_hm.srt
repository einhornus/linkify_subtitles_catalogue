1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
Sheep... weren't always this fluffy.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,519
We fluffy-fied them by breeding the fluffiest in each generation.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,399
This is domestication: sculpting wild animals for better human use.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,919
As we saw in Part 1, for early man, animals were powerful tools

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,439
...food, clothing, transportation, tractors.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,119
Yet, though there were animals everywhere, only a handful were domesticated in the pre-modern world.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,299
What made these different?

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,119
Let's make a domestication checklist, shall we?

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,579
First up: Feedable

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,079
A cow is a machine that turns grass into steaks

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,059
And a tiger a machine that turns steaks into… tiger.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,099
Ten pounds of grass make a pound of steak. And ten pounds of steak make a pound of tiger.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,499
... but these have the same number of calories -- so you might as well just eat the cow and save yourself a lot of work.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,059
So pure carnivores: you're not going to domesticate, just because of thermodynamics.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,339
You're looking for herbivores that aren't picky.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,559
They should eat something that's everywhere that you can't eat.

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,279
Any omnivores better be happy eating whatever and better be super worth it.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,999
We are, however, putting the pig before the pen here because first we need to catch something that's…

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,639
Friendly

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,699
OK, obviously catching a carnivore is a bad idea anyway because their day job is murder.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,059
But plenty of omnivores like grizzleys moonlight in murder.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,219
No safety in vegetarians either: buffalo are terrifying tanks for all the reasons mentioned before...

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,939
...hippos hold the murder high-score in Africa,

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,559
...giraffes look real dorky until you consider their striking range -- lions mostly leave them alone.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,919
Animals it would be awesome to domesticate are, not coincidentally, super dangerous.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,599
War bears would be a hell of an advantage for your tribe, but it's not going to happen.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,839
And if it's big and not dangerous, it's a nervous wreck.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,859
Try sneaking up on a gazelle? Rhymes with "LOL".

29
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,119
Sure, you and a team of buddies could spend the whole day marathon jogging it down to exhaustion...

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,899
...but if it doesn't break it's own neck as you try to drag it back home,

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,699
...then it's going to casually leap out of whatever pen you built for it.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,679
Ok, next up: some animals have reproductive -ah- preferences...

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,279
...that make them incompatible with captivity.  Looking at you, Pandas.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,859
The time and energy humans have spent to get pandas to get on with it is comical.

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,679
Hunter-Gatherers need an animal so eager to breed, it gets it wrong sometimes.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,179
... not an animal whose mating seasons they have to keep careful track of.

37
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,939
So: Friendly, Feedable and -- Fecund.

38
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,579
It also needs to grow up fast.

39
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,679
This gets us to the heart of domestication versus taming.

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,899
Again: to domesticate a species is to change it to make it better for us.

41
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,559
And side note here: we domesticate plants as well.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,919
We've bred them to be monstrous versions of their wild selves.

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,559
So when hippies talk about going back to nature, they forget that these plants are just as man made as this pop-tart.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,859
Anyway, back to the animals...

45
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,699
The pig porkification project succeeded because pig generations are shorter than human generations.

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,439
A single, clever human can make porky progress in their lifetime.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,399
Compare and contrast: Elephants.

48
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,999
Two years to make a calf, five years in between calves, nine years until female maturity, fifteen years for males?

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,479
You've got to be kidding, Elephants. There's no time for this.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,359
But humans can still tame elephants. You can catch an elephant, and train it not to freak out around humans.  Then, put it to work.

51
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,839
But elephant domestication would require accurate records over several human lives...

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,299
...never mind that keeping one or two tamed elephants around is incredibly costly

53
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,359
...which is why war elephants only happened on occasion in already complex societies.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,899
Tame elephants are a luxury, hence this rule of thumb: if it's on farm, it's domesticated, if it's in a circus, it's tame.

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,619
Finally: families.

56
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,459
OK: zebra vs horses.

57
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:40,619
Horses are civilization game-changers -- it's remarkable to think that from thousands BC until the telegraph...

58
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,799
...a dude on a horse was the best internet available.

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,699
Horses were domesticated in Eurasia, but humans started in Africa which has Zebra ...

60
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,519
...why didn't the first humans ride out of Africa on the backs of zebra to conquer the world?

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,779
Because zebra are bastards.  They live to kick and bite: dangerous in a pre-penicillin world.

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,419
...and zebra also have a ducking reflex making them very frustrating to lasso.

63
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,999
In addition to being a real pain in the ass animal, Zebra lack a family structure.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,659
Horse herds hierarchy -- you can see it when they travel in a line: the male, top female, her foals, second female, her foals, and so on.

65
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,679
Humans, by capturing and taming the lead male, become head horse.

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,099
Lots of barnyard animals are barnyard animals because they have family values humans exploit --

67
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,839
...they just  grow up with the idea that this human is a funny sort of take-charge cow or whatever.  No big deal.

68
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,059
Chickens will peck, peck, peck until they've worked out who's top chicken.

69
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,919
But you know whose really top chicken?  We're top chicken.

70
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,019
Dogs and cats: this is what makes them different.

71
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,859
Dogs will love you and defend you and hunt with you because you're part of the pack.

72
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,339
Dogs live to be useful to us -- which in the modern world means falling over to play dead -- but they love it

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,459
"Bang! .... Good girl. Good girl!" [laughing]

74
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,259
... whereas a cat is a tiny tiger that lives in your house.

75
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,479
Ok, back to these guys.

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,539
For zebra, there's no such thing as society.

77
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,279
They hang out in groups because it's a good survival strategy but they don't really care.

78
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,459
Catch a zebra and his family won't follow, try to ride him and you'll be lucky to keep your fingers.

79
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,339
Zebra look like horses on the outside, but not on the inside.

80
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,399
So that's the checklist: 
Friendly - Feedable - Fecund - Family Friendly

81
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,579
It's not a long checklist, but for Hunter-Gatherers, any animal they wanted to domesticate needed everything,...

82
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:33,079
...which is why in early human history only a bakers dozen of big animals were domesticated the world over.

83
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,819
