00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,372
‘Twas a Sunday morning when I woke up, happy and ready for the day, when suddenly…

2
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:04,959
[alarm sounding]

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,919
(as YouTube bot) 
Your access to YouTube has been suspended

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,092
(as Grey) 
Wha… why?

5
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:10,612
(as YouTube bot) 
because of a perceived violation of the terms of service

6
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:13,074
(as Grey) 
Really?  What could I have possibly done?

7
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:13,767
(as YouTube bot) 
Irrelevant!

8
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:17,305
“YouTube reserves the right to terminate your account at any time, for any reason."

9
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:19,350
Was this helpful?  Yes / No

10
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:23,714
(as Grey) 
This messenger from Olympus had reminded me that we are all but homunculi

11
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:27,047
at the whims of a capricious algorithmic god.

12
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:29,501
Which is useful to keep in mind.

13
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:31,927
So… yes?  Technically?

14
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:33,945
But I wasn’t happy with the gods.

15
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:37,003
So, I did what any brave hero would do.

16
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,825
Towards Olympus, I tweeted.

17
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:39,856
[birds chirping]

18
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:41,510
Alas, it was the weekend.

19
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:44,105
And there was no one to hear my chirping.

20
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:45,847
All was despair.

21
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:48,621
Now, you’re able to watch this video because I did, 

22
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:49,679
when the work week started,

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,074
eventually make it through the system to discover YouTube had 

24
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:56,727
suspended my account for impersonation -- of me.

25
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:58,656
Which was a bit… wut?

26
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:03,119
Maybe the YouTube bots thought my verified channel was acting a bit too ‘bot-like.’ 

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,167
Which is ridiculous.

28
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:05,536
So they shut it down.

29
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:06,665
But I may never know.

30
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,385
Anyway, I'm here reciting this's hero's ballad

31
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:12,141
as a reminder to everyone who makes things on a platform: 

32
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:13,999
that the gods are arbitrary 

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,127
and their rules of who can speak from Olympus are but words of whimsy on the wind.

34
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:22,941
And follow them or not, you may be knocked off at any time.

35
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:23,919
For any reason.

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,630
There is only one of the ancient, sleepy titans left from the pre-web days 

37
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:33,412
whose indifference to all allows all upon his mountain: Email.

38
00:01:33,413 --> 00:01:36,594
Though his son, Gmail sure is trying to dethrone him.

39
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:39,803
But, the titan still holds on… for now at least.

40
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:41,803
What I'm saying is if you're a creator,

41
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:44,710
I strongly suggest you get yourself an email list.

42
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:49,910
And if you're a viewer who likes the videos I make, consider signing up for my email list.

43
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:53,110
There's about a hundred thousand of you already there, which is amazing, 

44
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:57,803
but also far short of the millions of you here that YouTube says it 

45
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:02,790
very diligently and very reliably notifies about my videos. 

46
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,790
So before you watch the newest one,

47
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,207
(which I'm sure you got notified for)

48
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,496
please consider clicking here and joining my email list.

49
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,359
While you’re doing that, I’m going to work on my next video.

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,539
And also prepare a sacrifice to the gods to pray they don’t smite me again before it’s done.

51
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,893
