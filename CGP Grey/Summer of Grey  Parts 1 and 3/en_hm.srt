00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
Well that doesn't look good.

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,459
Hello, Lucy Liu.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,939
I am in North Carolina.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,979
It is the start of what is going to be five long weeks of business travel and business meetings.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,739
I'm trying to get better at business meetings.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:27,419
Also while I'm here I'm setting for myself the goal of escaping from America not fatter than I arrived

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,739
because I've fallen of the health bandwagon a bit lately and I really don't want to make things worse

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,459
but that might be impossible given that in America the streets are paved with donuts.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,519
But I'm gonna try and right now that's future Grey's problem.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,139
Current Grey is on the porch with a dog visiting family so no more vloging. And let's skip to

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,599
Denver, Colorado. Just stopping off to get some coffee and use the restroom and tornado shelter

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,979
and eat bad food strangely.

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,639
More details later, on to San Jose, California just south of San Francisco.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,319
Work travel is never fun but it's extra not fun when you arrive at the hotel to find out that

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,719
they don't have your room that you booked months ago.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,479
The reservation they have. But not the room.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:22,359
suspiciously, it seems many people who booked the hotel rooms at a super cheap price before the hotels realised that WWDC

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,419
had changed location to a new city.

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,099
Those people don't have rooms

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,139
The rooms had been re-rented at a higher price

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,119
So what happened to the people who do have a reservation?

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,999
Why conveniently they put you in a hotel on the other side of the city!

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,519
A hotel with the douchiest privacy please sign I have ever seen.

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,599
But I didn't fly across an ocean and a continent to be 45 minutes away from

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,399
all of the reasons that I'm here.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,039
So I was rather ... 'firm' ... with the hotel

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,359
and suddenly like magic they did have a free upgrade to a better room.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,639
But not for tonight.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,019
So I still have to be at this place and I can't set up any of my work

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,539
and it won't be 'till I drive back tomorrow morning

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,799
that I can actually get started on the reasons that I'm here

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,279
In fairness the apology suite is quite nice and it comes with an apology letter and apology chocolates

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,359
that I can't eat because I must escape from America not fatter

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,199
Travel protip: you could have stuff delivered to the hotel so you don't have to pack it.

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:31,519
::box opening sounds::

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:44,519
::more box opening sounds::

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,679
This is only half the boxes I have to unpack and I didn't unpack all of the boxes in the boxes but,

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,559
as I switched hotels this morning I'm running out of time before WWDC begins so I need to get outta here.

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,279
WWDC is a conference where Apple brings developers from the wide world to announce new features

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,059
of their software so programmers can implement them

42
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,159
Announcer: Welcome to WWDC

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,679
Grey: A ticket inside is a front row to the future

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,959
I don't have a ticket, I've got a hotel room,

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,179
and a wishlist, which is far more funny for crowd reactions anyway.

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,799
Many: Ohhh! Woooww! Oh!

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,619
Shots fired! God!

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,579
::chuckling::

49
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,659
And fooling around on Twitter during the boring parts.

50
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,259
TV: HomePod   Many: ::surprised laughs::

51
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,279
What? Hah. Wow.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,499
Keynote's over, now it's time to set up my mobile office,

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,759
ðŸŽµ Musical notes ðŸŽµ

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,199
Watch some technical talks,

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,839
Speaker: ... customizing your cheeseburger is way easier when someone

56
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,159
steps you through the process, one decision at a time.

57
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,399
Grey: Attend tech podcasts to discuss the tech,

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,979
sometimes with singalongs.

59
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,479
ðŸŽµ Podcast singalong ðŸŽµ

60
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,639
Which brings us too...

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,719
Why am I here?

62
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,939
At the end of WWDC, it's to record a podcast *about* WWDC.

63
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,999
The podcast is called "Cortex", on a network called "Relay",

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,659
and that's another reason that I'm here, 'cuz there's a big Relay listener meetup that I'm going too.

65
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,999
 

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,399
Past Grey didn't film anything at the event,

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,099
but, to be fair to him, he was running on low power mode at that point.

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,739
I really find jet lag so frustrating,

69
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,379
on this trip I'm *trying* to acclimatize to west coast time.

70
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,799
I was out last night at the Relay podcast meetup

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,219
I was just talking to people and then, POW

72
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,979
I was hit with that "I am going to fall asleep immediately' feeling.

73
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,319
So I come back to the hotel, to get a good night's sleep

74
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,259
but no, of course here I am, it's 4 in the morning

75
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,139
and I know I'm just gonna be awake for a while

76
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,099
like a zombie. ::sigh::

77
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,199
 

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,399
Thanks jet lag.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,459
 

80
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,059
I was on my way to go find some coffee,

81
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,599
I think this is uhh,

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,259
this is what I need to do today.

83
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,339
This is Goal #1

84
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,259
But later, coffee first.

85
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,019
All right, time to do this.

86
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,859
 

87
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,619
I tried to do some fancy camera work, but then this happened,

88
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,479
so, forget that, no more recording in gyms while I'm doing weight stuff,

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,819
it feels super weird to vlog then anyway

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,319
 

91
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,499
America is a place where you can really double down on your eating mistakes.

92
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,519
I really want to avoid that, so my plan while I'm here

93
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,719
is just to cut out as many carbohydrates as I can from my diet.

94
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,739
This means no pancakes, no bread,

95
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,139
no pastas, no pizza, no crackers,

96
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,859
normally the kind of stuff I would eat an

97
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,499
enormous amount of when I'm under a lot of pressure

98
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,819
and doing a lot of work.

99
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,219
And since I'm also travelling at the same time it's kind of doubly hard,

100
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,759
but it is possible to do if you can eat the eggs, but not the muffin.

101
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,019
So I'm going to the supermarket to load up on all the

102
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,259
kinds of things that I'm going to be eating lots of.

103
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,999
Meat and cheese and eggs and emergency almonds and emergency jerky

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,559
It's not fun, and it's not what I want to do,

105
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,759
but this is the most simple and effective thing that I have found in the past for

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,819
dropping or maintaining weight and,

107
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,539
if there's one thing I could use this summer, it's a bit of simple.

108
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:23,279
Thank you Check Out Robot, you don't ask any questions, and I really appreciate you for that.

109
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,999
Check Out Robot: $5.99

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,319
Grey: Conferencing is mentally taxing but I find it

111
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,679
helps to map the outlines of the day and try to specify what

112
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,139
objectives for time well spent are, what I need to do,

113
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,939
who I need to see, what sessions I should go to,

114
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,319
and as a personal development point, I'm trying to get better at

115
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,139
meeting with interesting people while I'm business travelling and,

116
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,979
these conferences can be a crazy overlapping puzzle of everyone's schedules.

117
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,639
Right now I am on my way to a meeting with someone,

118
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,419
the only time we could find for both of us that overlapped

119
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,039
is while he's packing his bags to go. *Laughs*

120
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,619
So that's where I'm headed.

121
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,259
 

122
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,239
Alright, packing meeting over,

123
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,699
on to more stuff.

124
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,999
 

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,739
The no carbohydrates health plan is going pretty well so far

126
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,799
but now during business meetings I'm the weirdo who's not eating the burger bun and has to explain why.

127
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,639
 

128
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,419
Do I recognize the model of truck?

129
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,099
I do not.  ::Car mates laugh::

130
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,519
I've been lucky enough to be invited to see some interesting headquarters in the past

131
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,059
including Dropbox, and Facebook.

132
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,799
This time it's Google, with their

133
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,399
"Why is there a dinosaur over there?"

134
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,019
and

135
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,859
"This is a sad dystopian graveyard of androids past."

136
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,679
 

137
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,399
and office interior they really you rather didn't film.

138
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,699
Then on to the computer history museum with

139
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,159
"So many buttons."

140
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,799
"I want to press them all"

141
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,819
and remembered fun things long forgotten,

142
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,739
and traumatic things long forgotten,

145
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,659
and got totally distracted by seeing my first Tesla charger in real life.

146
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,499
 

147
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,779
Oh god,

148
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,479
 

149
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,799
Tesla's, Tesla's as far as the eye can see.

Oh this is the X!

153
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,558
I am pretty tired and I really don't wanna,

154
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,359
it's been a long day,

155
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,939
but I'm going into the gym.

156
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,678
Man, everywhere you go in America,

157
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,178
Screens, screens, screens.

158
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,779
But you know what?

159
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,259
 

160
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,759
Thank you, but no thank you.

161
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,959
 

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,859
Alright, I'm doing this.

163
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,559
 

164
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,499
Pretty pleased about that.

165
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,719
I had just,

166
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,819
I really didn't wanna do it,

167
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,419
but I'd only just barely started a streak of exercising

168
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,659
so I wasn't gonna quit on the third day.

169

::Shower noises::

170
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,379

But yeah,

172
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,159
 

173
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,679
not a thing that I wanted to do.

174
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,819
but I'm very glad It's done,

175
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,239
and now

176
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,719
 

177
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,039
it's shower time.

179
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,119
I've yet to be at a conference that doesn't feel like it's just

180
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,379
one day too long,

181
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,499
and this is the last day.

182
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,579
The big responsibility today is to record Cortex,

183
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,459
but before that happens I want to try to fit in just a little bit of exercise.

184
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,899
I'm gonna get my bicycling in while I prepare for Cortex.

185
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:19,339
 

186
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,559
So I've got the bike, it looks like, on the map there's a park along the Guadalupe river,

187
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,959
so I'm taking the bike there,

188
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,879
I'm gonna go for a little bit of a ride.

189
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,719
 

190
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,119
Now I've gotten into the habit,

191
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,839
-Oh there we go; Guadalupe river park-

192
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,559
Uhh, I've gotten into the habit of

193
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,179
not listening to music while I do aerobic exercise.

194
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,699
It makes exercising a good time to think,

195
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,019
and like today I'm going to be combining

196
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,819
the exercise with preparing for Cortex.

197
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,159
So I've taken a look at the show notes, I've loaded them up in my head,

198
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,399
I'm gonna go for a little bike ride and think about

199
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,159
what i'm gonna talk about on Cortex today.

200
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,779
Just as soon as I can figure out how to get

201
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,519
down into the park.

202
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,219
 

203
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,679
Now it's time to attach the GoPro.

204
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,879
 

205
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,879
Perfect.

206
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,859
 

207
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,559

Thanks little buddy,

210
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,119
that was way better than cycling indoors.

211
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,639
Time for shower, and podcast.

212
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,559
 

213
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,819
(oh no)

214
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,539
 

215
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,019
(this is the worst)

216
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,679
 

217
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,899
(I have to hide now for a little while)

218
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,619
 

219
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,599
(I'm gonna be late to the podcast)

220
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,919
 

221
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,919
Can't do a podcast unless you have enough coffee to get though a podcast.

222
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,619
I'm bringing the coffee.

223

Myke: We're in the same place,

226
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,299
Grey: Yeah...   Myke: We're working on something together in the same place.

227
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,799

Grey: We are.

231
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,959
Myke: But last year you made me record in a hotel room

232
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,519
Grey: I did.   Myke: and you were in your hotel room

233
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,519
and we used Skype.

234
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,319
Grey: Yes. That's true.

235
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,659
Myke: But this year,    Grey: mmmhmmm

236
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,979
Myke: you suggested "Why don't we record in person?"

237
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,759
Grey: ::sigh:: I didn't suggest it,

238
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,819
Myke: I feel like you did.

239
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,479
Grey: you suggested it,   Myke: OK

240
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,379
Grey: and I agreed

241
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,759
because I have a lot of audio equipment

242
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,139
in my room right now that I really didn't want to unbox. ::chuckles::

243
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,079
Myke: Ahhhhh, that makes sense.

244
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,079
Ok. Put the burden on me.

245
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,939
 

246
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,759
Grey: Everyone is gone.

247
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,159
I'm still here because I need an extra day to prepare.

248
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,759
There's a place I need to get to by a certain time and it's a bit--

249
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,079
It's going to end up being a bit involved.

250
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,159
So I'm guessing this log, which I originally though was just gonna be a short thing

251
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,559
at some conferences is going to end up being,

252
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,479
ah, a much longer thing, like two or three parts?

253
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,039
I don't know, that's Future Grey's editing problem.

254
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,659
Now Grey's problem is packing.

255
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,639
For suitcases and stuff the rule is:

256
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,739
"Only bags go inside of suitcases, not things."

257
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,879
Bags, in suitcases.

258
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,099
Things can go in the bags, not in the suitcase.

259
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,279
Alright, I got the packing done way faster than expected

260
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,699
because, of course I realized:

261
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,319
I don't need to pack it "well", I just need to get it all boxed up so I--

262

270
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,719
I'm here the day before VidCon starts,

271
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,099
the pre-conference feeling is nice.

272
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,519
I always like being in places before the action happens,

273
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,759
as it's being setup.

274
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,519
It's the feeling of "potential".

275
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,859
All that potential of what could be

276
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,079
before what actually happens

277
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,059
empties you to the core.

278
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,479
And this conference, this VidCon,

279
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,179
is particularly draining because

280
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,839
the longer you spend time near LA,

281
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,359
the more desaturated your life becomes.

282
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,379
LA is a dementor in city form.

283
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,339
But right now I'm still fresh, I like exploring,

284
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,879
I like the feeling of solitude in places that should be full.

285
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,159
It's peaceful. And it wont stay that way for long.

::more loud noises::

298
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:07,379
I'm so exhausted and these cookies are everywhere, depleting my willpower, in all of the lounges.

299
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,699
Everywhere there aren't crowds, there are cookies.

300
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,259
A cookie would feel so good right now. But I must resist

301
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,919
In case you're wondering, I stayed off of carbs during part two.

302
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,719
It's been about three weeks so far without carbs and this is the final hard stretch

303
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,939
as VidCon is such an assault on the mind and to cope with it, I've chosen poorly in years past

304
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,339
Someone: What?   Grey: You overestimate the power of this

305
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,339
I don't understand why you even thing this is interesting.

306
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,479
Someone: Brady's gonna wanna see the snap from you.

307
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,339
Grey: OK?

00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,259
Someone: ::laughs::

309
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,419
I'm making better choices this time.

310
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,979
But America really doesn't help when there's a pizza button on the phone and a sign for the pizza button

311
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,659
I think they really want me to eat pizza but I'm going to stay strong.

312
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:16,159
Only two weeks left to escape from America not fatter.

313
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,719
I feel like this place is the opposite of me.

314
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:30,859
::Screaming::

315
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:43,459
So much screaming and filming

316
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,979
Casey: OK, so the question was:

317
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:56,259
You guys with your cameras, everyone behind you can't see me

318
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:04,039
Amazing

319
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,259
There's people everywhere

320
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,019
Well, almost everywhere

321
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,079
Panelist: ...what the internet really killed is the mass media business model.

322
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,959
We tried to take that scarcity based model into this abundance based world,

323
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,139
prices go down, desperation goes up, we end up with cats and kardashians,

324
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,759
you see, as the ultimate clickbait. And it worked! Right?

325
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,499
So... How do we rethink the business model of News?

326
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:51,499
Heh... Good luck with that

327
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,999
Future Grey taking over here

328
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,499
As, at this point, Past Grey was really pushed beyond his social limits

329
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,739
Suddenly there is no more talking to the camera

330
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,999
There is just simply no more talking.

331
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,999
This first summer of Grey was exhausting beyond my ability to explain

332
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,159
But it was also a great and hugely successful trip.

333
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,339
I wanted to try to have more meetings with people

334
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,999
And boy did I ever...

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,199
But it was time to go.

336
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,499
I needed a break, and there was a place I wanted to go

337
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,399
Where I could just be quiet

338
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,999
And not have to see people

339
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,999
And not have to do anything

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,359
And just recharge for a while.

341
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,999
So that's where I went.

342
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,499
And there is perhaps nothing more uplifting to the human soul

343
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,499
Than taking a flight out of LA to a place where you actually want to be.

344
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,499
So I recharged for a while,

345
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,999
I went back to North Carolina to see my family again,

346
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,999
And then I returned home to London.

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,499
And thus ended the Summer of Grey.

348
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Oh right! I also came back not fatter.
