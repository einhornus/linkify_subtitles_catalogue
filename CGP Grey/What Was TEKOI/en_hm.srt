1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
This is the Tekoi Test Range.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,202
Or, at least it once was. 

3
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:06,820
The site is long abandoned now, but

4
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:08,820
it once served a vital purpose. 

5
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,268
A military purpose.

6
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,784
And the work done at Tekoi is still out in the world today.

7
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:16,660
Constructed during the Cold War,

8
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:20,122
at the entrance to the facility is a warning sign in Russian, 

9
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:22,653
but this is not the former Soviet Union. 

10
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:24,479
This is the great state of Utah, 

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,264
where, in Skull Valley, Tekoi resides.

12
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:29,795
Much of what happened on site was classified.

13
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,326
And equipment and documents were removed.

14
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:33,868
But what remains is enough

15
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,064
to piece together the story of Tekoi.

16
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:37,628
The paperwork left behind

17
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:40,202
bears the logo of Hercules Incorporated.

18
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:42,973
Hercules got its start in the late 1800s

19
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:44,973
with a patent improving on dynamite

20
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:46,973
the creator named 'Hercules Powder', 

21
00:00:46,974 --> 00:00:49,657
and began manufacturing the new explosive

22
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:51,613
just outside of San Francisco

23
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:54,348
in a company town that would outlive the company.

24
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:55,962
Hercules, California.

25
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:59,228
Chemical manufacturing at the turn of the century was dangerous.

26
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:01,228
And about 60 people would die

27
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,569
in several explosions over the years.

28
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,540
Hercules made many chemical products 

29
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,999
but their smokeless gunpowder rapidly grew them

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,908
to become a vital United States military supplier

31
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,231
during the world wars.

32
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:13,468
As the poster said, 

33
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,435
"Hercules men and women in the war: Keep 'em Shooting."

34
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:17,831
The Cold War came next

35
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,409
and brought with it a new weapon.

36
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,591
The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, 

37
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:23,460
tipped with a nuclear warhead. 

38
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:26,348
Now, one country could destroy another remotely, 

39
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,297
and the only defense was

40
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:30,297
a credible threat of retaliation.

41
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,791
This drew the United States and the Soviet Union

42
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,009
into an arms race, building more and 

43
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,133
better nuclear weapons each year.

44
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,268
Technological development

45
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:40,428
led to solid fuel rocket motors.

46
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:42,151
Unlike earlier liquid-based missiles, 

47
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:43,962
which had to be launched out in the open

48
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:45,082
and were slow to fuel,

49
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,599
the new motors allowed nuclear missiles to be hidden.

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,351
America's cornfields would grow to 

51
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:51,839
contain one thousand underground silos.

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,671
Each ready with a fast-launching

53
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:55,206
Minuteman missile inside.

54
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,402
But ground silos are in fixed locations,

55
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,744
and, once discovered, cannot be moved.

56
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,177
Nuclear bombers are mobile,

57
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:03,177
but planes can be found by radar.

58
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:05,679
However, submarines can hide in the sea,

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,871
difficult to find.

60
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,209
So the United States developed 

61
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,969
the Ohio class submarine,

62
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,133
the largest yet built,

63
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:14,559
for carrying a new solid fuel Trident nuclear missile.

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,751
The United States ordered

65
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:17,577
twenty-four Ohios to be built,

66
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,089
each with a maximum complement

67
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,442
of twenty-four Tridents.

68
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:23,089
Each Trident carried up to fourteen warheads.

69
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,177
A combined maximum delivery potential

70
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,589
of more than eight thousand nuclear bombs.

71
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,817
Thus, were the United States and her Minutemen

72
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,519
to be destroyed in a first strike,

73
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,315
and all her aircraft shot down,

74
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:35,315
there would still be more than enough Tridents

75
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:36,879
launching from the hidden deep to 

76
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,264
safely assure mutual destruction.

77
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:41,911
Which brings us back to Hercules and Tekoi.

78
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,519
For as the bullet in a round needs powder to hit a target, 

79
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,853
so too does the nuclear warhead in a 

80
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:50,348
Trident missile need its solid fuel motor. 

81
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,209
Hercules manufactured the motors

82
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,966
at a plant called Bacchus West in Magna, Utah, 

83
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,966
and brought them to Tekoi for testing.

84
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,329
The large concrete cubes still here

85
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,362
are thrust blocks.

86
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,449
Their purpose to be an immovable object

87
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,242
for a missile motor to push against during test firing.

88
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:08,049
Each motor needed to be individually calibrated.

89
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,231
Hitting a target a quarter of the world away

90
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,017
while traveling at Mach 20 is a precise affair.

91
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:15,257
So once in place against the thrust block,

92
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:17,460
technicians would connect sensors to the motor

93
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:19,002
to measure heat and pressure, 

94
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,719
and those sensors connected via

95
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,719
underground cables to instrument bunkers,

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,719
where engineers would record the results

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,860
with state-of-the-art 1970s computer assistance.

98
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:30,326
Setup for each test could take a week or more,

99
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,726
so the motor and engineers and equipment

100
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,886
had to be protected from the elements. 

101
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:37,620
But a missile can't be fired inside a building

102
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:39,279
without melting the structure around it

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,835
and invalidating the test. 

104
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:44,173
To solve this, the buildings at Tekoi were constructed on rails 

105
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:46,508
so they could be pulled back before firing.

106
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,017
And also give the nearby camera houses

107
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,428
a clear view of the test.

108
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:55,155
[unknown speaker on radio]
This will be the firing of D5 second stage Pet Five B250.

109
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:55,969
[radio clicking]

110
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,540
Minus ten...

111
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,515
nine...

112
00:03:58,516 --> 00:03:59,395
eight...

113
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:00,428
seven...

114
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:01,388
six...

115
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,379
five...

116
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,329
four...

117
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,384
three...

118
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,409
two...

119
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,369
one...

120
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,235
zero!

121
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:08,748
We have ignition.

122
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,784
[Grey]
Hercules did improve on safety since its start in California

123
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,108
a hundred years earlier.

124
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,235
The large poles around each test site are lightning rods 

125
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:19,619
to divert strikes from the area's numerous

126
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,619
storms and to prevent explosions.

127
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,660
Nonetheless, one man was killed at Tekoi.

128
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:28,079
In 1984, crushed beneath a motor that came loose

129
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,911
during securement to the test block.

130
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:33,017
An accident for which the United States Occupational Safety

131
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:36,668
and Health Administration fined Hercules $640.

132
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:40,326
The end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules. 

133
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,493
The United States had been slowing production

134
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:43,409
of nuclear warheads, 

135
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,409
and needed fewer missiles to carry them.

136
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,897
Tekoi was used less as a testing site, 

137
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,664
and more as a storage location

138
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,453
as military contracts dried up,

139
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:54,631
leading to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s.

140
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,631
Though the United States no longer needed

141
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,762
the facility for strategic production. 

142
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:01,569
It was still strategically useful in a different way.

143
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,675
Politics.

144
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:05,635
In 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union signed 

145
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:08,268
START, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,

146
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,428
where both agreed to reduce the size

147
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:11,897
of their nuclear stockpiles.

148
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:14,159
Because, of course, neither country was

149
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,020
just going to take the word of the other, 

150
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:19,249
numerous trust-but-verify policies were put into place. 

151
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,460
For example, both sides disabling their

152
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,169
long range bombers out in the open

153
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,169
for the others' satellites to see.

154
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,679
And, each country picked weapon production sites

155
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,900
the other could inspect. 

156
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,566
The United States provided a list

157
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,442
of dozens of sites for the Soviets, 

158
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:34,711
one of which was the Tekoi Test Range. 

159
00:05:34,712 --> 00:05:37,853
And is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance.

160
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,977
Temporary housing for the inspection team

161
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,620
was built in the Soviet Union

162
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,879
to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls 

163
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,209
or tampered with the equipment,  

164
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,802
and transported to Utah.

165
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,202
Forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna,

166
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:51,991
the flags of which had to be changed

167
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,729
after the Soviet Union dissolved

168
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,580
and inspection duties fell to the Russian Federation.

169
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,235
Tekoi limped on during the inspection period, 

170
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:02,420
but, in 1995, with too many canceled contracts,

171
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:04,420
the now-failing Hercules Incorporated

172
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:05,773
put itself up for sale,

173
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:08,013
acquired by Alliant Techsystems, 

174
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:10,399
an American aerospace, defense and… 

175
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,780
sporting goods company.

176
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,689
In 1999, the lease on this land expired.

177
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,937
Alliant Techsystems did not renew

178
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:18,937
and control of the Tekoi Test Range 

179
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:21,540
reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation, 

180
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,839
within the borders of which Tekoi sits.

181
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,024
Though Tekoi operates no more, its work lives on. 

182
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:31,460
220 Trident nuclear missiles are still actively deployed.

183
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,173
Waiting.

184
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,715
