00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:05,559
Queen Lion of the animal kingdom is looking
to improve her democracy. She recently allowed

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,929
citizens to elect representatives to the Jungle
Council which governs the kingdom.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,959
However, she recognizes that her citizens
are not happy with the voting system. Let’s

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,719
watch an election on one of the small islands
of her Kingdom to see why:

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,409
On this island there are three political parties:
the two big ones: Kea and Tuatara, and a small

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,418
third party, Kakapo.

7
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:28,399
On election day, the citizens each cast one
vote for a local candidate they want to represent

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,018
the range they live in. The results are as
follows:

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,649
With the average across the island that Tuatara
gets 49%, Kea gets 48% and Kakapo gets 3%.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,459
The election is run using First Past the Post,
meaning that candidate with the most votes

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,819
wins. Because Tuatara got the most votes in
each range, they get to control 100% of the

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,819
seats on the council.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,659
And this is why so many citizens are unhappy.
The majority of them, the 51% who voted for

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,449
other parties, get no representation on the
council at all.

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,809
This seems unfair to Queen Lion but she’s
not sure how to fix it. The citizens like

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,749
having local representatives and don’t want
to change the range boundaries.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,639
But luckily Kiwi, one of the citizens of this
island, has a suggestion for Queen Lion on

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,649
how she can make the system better while keeping
local representation and leaving the ranges

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,649
as they are.

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:18,099
The idea is called Mixed Member Proportional
or MMP and it makes two changes: the number

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,559
of seats on the council is doubled and each
citizen gets two votes, not one.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,408
Here’s how it works:

23
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,298
At first, election day for Kiwi is just the
same as before.

24
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,618
He gets a list of candidates running to represent
his local range on the council. Kiwi picks

25
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,248
one and the winner will be the candidate with
the most votes.

26
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:39,149
So far the system is no better – Tuatara
again wins all the local elections and still

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,068
more than half of the citizens don’t have
any representation. But here’s how Kiwi’s

28
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,099
second vote – and those extra seats on the
council – fix this.

29
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,688
Kiwi uses his second vote to pick his favorite
political party.

30
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,108
These second votes are tallied up and show
the percentage of support that each of the

31
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:57,340
political parties has among the citizens as
a whole and reveals how imbalanced the council

32
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:58,340
is so far.

33
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:02,868
To fix this imbalance, members of the political
parties are added, one at a time, to make

34
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,078
the council more proportional.

35
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,879
Tuatara is the most over-represented and Kea
the most underrepresented, so Kea gets the

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,618
first empty seat.

37
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,318
This continues, adding one Kea at a time until
both Turatara and Kea are over-represented

38
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,818
and Kakapo is under-represented, so they get
the final seat.

39
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,619
Now, the jungle council represents, as close
as possible, the actual preferences of the

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,518
citizens – which is a huge improvement over
the old, first past the post method.

41
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,169
There is, however, one interesting question
that should arise at this point:

42
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,399
Exactly who decides which members of the parties
get those extra seats?

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,708
The way it works is that, before the election,
the political parties make a list of their

44
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,969
favorite candidates in the order that they
want them to get on the council.

45
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,119
So, if there is only get one extra seat, the
name at the top of their list is chosen. If

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,839
they get two seats, the first two are chosen,
and so on.

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,219
This makes MMP a bit different from other
voting methods in that it makes political

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,389
parties an official part of the way the election
works.

49
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,809
This may give the party leaders greater control
over their members because they can reward

50
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,699
or punish their actions by changing their
placement on the party list.

51
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,458
While this may be a disadvantage of MMP there
are a number of other benefits that Queen

52
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,839
Lion, in particular, likes.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,499
Because fewer votes are wasted, it mostly
Eliminates Gerrymandering and prevents minority

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,499
rule.

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,249
It also gives more choice to the citizens
by encouraging political diversity.

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,199
This point is worth expanding on.

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,149
Notice how, with MMP, the percentage of votes
for the local representatives isn’t the

58
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,408
same as for the parties. This is because in
the local elections, citizens have to vote

59
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,708
strategically.

60
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,158
For example, Kakapo voters don’t like Tuatara
at all, but they can tolerate Kea. Since there

61
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,929
are so few Kakapo voters they know that their
candidate doesn’t have a chance of winning

62
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,669
the local election, so it’s really a race
between the two big parties. Thus many of

63
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,358
the Kakapo will vote Kea in the hope that
he might win and be their representative.

64
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:51,568
However, when it comes to voting for their
favorite political party, this strategy doesn’t

65
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,929
matter. The more votes a party gets the more
representatives it has on the council.

66
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,809
So citizens are free to vote for smaller parties
they like like knowing that every vote counts.

67
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,339
Queen Lion reviews her options and decides
to switch her Kingdom to MMP. Now, for the

68
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:28,939
first time, the Jungle Council is a true reflection
of what her citizens want.
