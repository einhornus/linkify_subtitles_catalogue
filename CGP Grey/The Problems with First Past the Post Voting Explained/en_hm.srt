00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,329
Welcome to the problem with first past the
post voting explained by me, C. G. P. Grey

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,259
The royal family has a problem. But this isn't
just any royal family, these are the lions

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,259
-- rulers of the jungle since time immemorial.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,319
There are protests over the monarchy's absolute
power and the citizens of the Animal Kingdom

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,159
want a say in how they are governed.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,239
Bending to the pressure, Lion has abdicated
his crown and king is to be an elected office.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,278
To ensure a smooth transition -- and because
she is craftier than her husband -- the queen

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,688
lioness is remaining on the throne with the
power to set the rules for all elections in

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,097
her kingdom.

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,099
She has declared that all citizens get one
and only one vote and that the candidate with

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,299
the most votes wins the crown.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,799
This method of voting is most often called
First Past the Post (awkwardly abbreviated

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,919
as FPTP) or Winner Take All.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,569
This system is simple, fair and logical. Right?

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,589
Actually, no.

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,069
It's a terrible, terrible idea.

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,069
Why?

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,029
Well, to see the problems with first past
the post, lets watch the first election unfold

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,578
in the Animal Kingdom

20
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,069
It's an exciting time for the burgeoning democracy
and seven hopeful candidates come forward

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,019
to run and represent their parties. They put
on their best campaigns, citizens head out

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,429
to the polls and the votes are counted. The
results come in as follows:

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,889
Turtle gets 9% of the vote.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,149
Monkey gets 18%.

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,349
Gorilla gets 19%.

26
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,429
Owl gets 13%.

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,429
Leopard gets 20%.

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,709
Tiger gets 15%.

29
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,709
Snake gets 6%.

30
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,701
Under the rules of First Past the Post, Leopard
is Crowned the winner and she gets to rule

31
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,701
for the length of her term.

32
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,449
But take another look at the results, and
you see the first problem with this system:

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,100
minority rule. The vast majority of citizens
-- 80% -- wanted someone else as king, but

34
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:30,749
Leopard still won. There were only seven candidates
in this race but if you imagine that had been

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,179
twenty, she might only gotten 5% of the vote,
but still been elected.

36
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,079
This problem with minority rule is only the
beginning.

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,649
The second problem with first past the post
is that, given enough time, it results in

38
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,359
an inevitable, unavoidable two-party system.

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,359
Why?

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,499
To see, lets watch what happens over several
election cycles...

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,279
Leopard has had her term in office and it's
election time in the young democracy. Only

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,999
now, all the citizens of the Animal Kingdom
remember the results from last time.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,579
This information changes how they will behave.
Particularly Snake and Turtle voters -- who

44
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,118
must face the reality that they backed unappealing,
extremist candidates who don't have a chance

45
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,118
of winning.

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,449
Turtle voters, who were unhappy under Leopard
rule, decided to back the candidate who has

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,339
the best chance winning, Gorilla.

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,348
Now snake voters want to vote for Tiger -- who
is the candidate they have the most in common

49
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,789
with, but they are afraid to because Leopard
is running a negative campaign against her

50
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,169
competitors.

51
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,759
Snake voters, not liking the idea of Gorilla
rule, vote strategically for Leopard.

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,568
The final results look like this, with Leopard
getting 26% of the vote and Gorilla getting

53
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,799
28, making him the new king.

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,169
Snake and Turtle, seeing their dismal results
and the cost of their campaigns decide to

55
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,039
drop out of future races.

56
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,488
What started out as a seven party system is
now down to five.

57
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,899
Fast-Forward to the next election:

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,449
Only five candidates run, and again the voters
remember what happened last time.

59
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,369
In this election, it's Owl voters who recognize
that their candidate cannot win. They are

60
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,729
centrist voters and less ideological than
the rest of the Animal Kingdom -- as such

61
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,859
they don't really like either Gorilla or Leopard.

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,169
Both Gorilla and Leopard know this, so they
each negative campaigns to capitalize on the

63
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,809
fears of the centrists.

64
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,139
Owl voters split their vote, and are mostly
voting against the candidate they dislike,

65
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,479
rather than supporting the candidate they
do like.

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,409
After this election, Gorilla gets 33% of the
vote and leopard gets 34% making her the winner.

67
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,889
Owl, as did Turtle and Snake before her, drops
out of the race.

68
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,159
In the last election we will look at, Monkey
and Tiger voters are unhappy. They both really

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,179
like the candidates they have supported, but
they have to compromise. Monkey voters, agree

70
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,239
with Gorilla on a few issues but they really
don't like Leopard. Tiger voters agree with

71
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,549
leopard on some issues, but really don't like
Gorilla.

72
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,749
They strategically abandon their preferred
candidate out of fear of the one they disagree

73
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,399
with the most becoming king.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,199
The final results are Leopard 49% and Gorilla
51% with him being crowned king.

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,579
Monkey and Tiger are the last candidates to
drop out and now the Animal Kingdom is left

76
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,779
with a two party system.

77
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,249
Because of the centrist and sway-able Owl
voters, in future elections Leopard might

78
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,018
take the crown, then Gorilla wins it back,
only to lose it two Leopard again, but the

79
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,839
two parties never change.

80
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,229
The citizens of animal kingdom ended up with
this system, not because they are lazy voters

81
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,579
or because its what they really wanted, but
because of the mathematics of how the system

82
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,699
is set up.

83
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,869
Inevitably, given enough time, all first past
the post systems trend towards two main parties.

84
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,329
But the choices of the voters still hasn't
changed since that first election. Only two-fifths

85
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,629
of them want either Leopard or Gorilla as
their first choice and 3/5ths of them want

86
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,369
someone else as their first choice.

87
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,268
It's this majority of the voters that become
disinterested in the democratic process because

88
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,838
they feel they have no meaningful way to express
their real preferences.

89
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,179
But it only gets worse from here. If the citizens
of Animal Kingdom are divided into groups

90
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,339
before they vote, they are susceptible to
gerrymandering.

91
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,569
Gerrymandering is a bit tricky, but imagine
a block of ten homes each with one voter inside.

92
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,839
Three are Leopard voters, three are Gorilla
voters and four are Owl voters.

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,539
If the voters are divided up into groups before
they vote, whoever decides where the lines

94
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,439
are drawn has enormous influence on who will
win the election.

95
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,739
For example, if you group the three Leopard
voters with two Owl voters and do the same

96
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,059
with the three gorilla voters. You can illuminate
owl from the election, even though owl voters

97
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,459
have the largest minority and should win under
a straight first-past-the post vote.

98
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,429
If the leopard and gorilla parties are in
charge when the voting boundaries are drawn,

99
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,649
they have enormous incentive to carve out
safe seats for themselves.

100
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,859
But more on Gerrymandering in another video.

101
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,589
Bah! You say, Vote 3rd party and change the
system!

102
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,339
This brings us to the final, and possibly
worst, problem of First Past the Post: the

103
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,649
Spoiler Effect

104
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,388
Imagine now its been years and years of Gorilla
and Leopard rule.

105
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,109
Tiger decides it's time to enter the race.
He thinks that the voters are tired of the

106
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,489
status-quo and he has a shot at winning.

107
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,649
He sets up his campaign office, gets a surprising
amount of gold in donations and gets on the

108
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,679
Animal News Network to debate with the main
candidates.

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,049
Election night comes around, but alas, Tiger
gets only 15% of the vote -- mostly from Leopard

110
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,698
voters, who are closest to him on the political
spectrum. Gorilla easily beats Leopard and

111
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,379
gets to be king.

112
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,359
The first past the post system at its worst:
the better a 3rd party candidate does, the

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,138
more it hurts its own voters by guaranteeing
a loss for the party they most agree with

114
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,379
and a win for the party they disagree with.

115
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,909
And don't forget, Gorilla is no fool: he knows
how the system works. Where do you think some

116
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,509
of those gold donations came from?

117
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,399
Meanwhile, The Queen Lioness is displeased.

118
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,859
She's been observing the elections and sees
that the system is bad for her subjects. And

119
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,849
she's been thinking, what makes a good voting
system? Well...

120
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,089
You should be able to vote for the candidate
you like the most, without worrying.

121
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,259
More choice in representatives is better.

122
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,969
The system shouldn't be susceptible to gerrymandering.

123
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,379
And it should be open to new political parties.

124
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,568
Luckily for the queen, there are several different
voting systems to choose from -- including

125
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:20,549
the alternative vote. But that will have to
be discussed in detail at another time.

126
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:29,660
Thank you very much for watching.
