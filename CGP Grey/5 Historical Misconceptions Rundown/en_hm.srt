# 5.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,189
Vikings

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,179
What would a Viking be without his trusty
battle helmet and its impressive horns?

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,649
The answer is: a more historically accurate
viking.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,440
Think, for a moment about wearing headgear
like that into battle: the horns are just

6
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:18,089
easy targets for your opponent to hit and
knock off your helmet.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,149
Or, if you strap on your helmet, now your
opponent has a convenient lever with which

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,589
to drag you to the ground and something to
hold onto while slitting your throat.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,329
Horned helmets are a terrible idea, which
is why archeologists have never found them

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,009
at viking battle sites and there's no evidence
that they were ever used.

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,279
It was poets and artists -- people not known
for caring about facts and reality -- who

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,819
gave the Vikings their silly hats during the
late 1800s, long after the vikings could 'correct'

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,169
their misconceptions.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,198
4.

15
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,198
Lady Godiva

16
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:45,998
The story of this 11th century English noblewoman
is that her mean husband the Earl raised taxes

17
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:49,549
on the townspeople of Coventry which Lady
Godiva -- and not surprising the locals -- thought

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,818
were too high.

19
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:54,459
She badgered her husband and he conceded in
exasperation to lower the taxes if she rode

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,749
through town naked -- assuming that she never
would, but she did.

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,128
Because people don't likes taxes -- even though
they're how civilization is purchased -- Lady

22
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:05,089
Godiva's story lives on notably in the Godiva
logo and in popular songs.

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,759
But while Lady Godiva was a real person and
Coventry is a real town there is no record

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,299
of her nude ride from the time when it happened
-- so we can assume the story is false.

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,589
Just as with the Vikings, again poets and
artists are to blame, who made up the tale

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,979
long after Lady Godiva's death.

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,979
3.

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,979
Napoleon

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,749
Famously this tiny, tiny general -- perhaps
to compensate for his short stature -- took

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,789
control of France greatly expanded its influence
and dubbed himself emperor.

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,019
Napoleon's official height was indeed 5 foot
2 inches but at the time French inches were

32
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,409
longer than English inches, so doing the unit
conversion, Napoleon's height should have

33
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,589
been reported as 5'7 in England's imperial
units -- which is short by today's standard

34
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,929
but was average or slightly above average
in the early 1800s.

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,659
However England, with it's eternal love for
all things French, didn't care and went the

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,539
Napoleon-is-so-short-LOL version of the story
in newspapers and cartoons.

37
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,869
Meanwhile, Napoleon was busy introducing the
Metric System to France and the wider world

38
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,119
to standardize measurements so this sort of
confusion would never happen again -- and

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,719
thankfully the whole world now uses metric.

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,719
Mostly.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,719
Sort of.

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,719
2.

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,719
Roman Vomit

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,029
Ah, the Roman empire, so great and powerful,
but corrupted by decadence from within.

45
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,589
And what could be a better symbol of that
decadence than the Vometorum: where Romans,

46
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,869
after stuffing themselves with delicious foods,
could vomit them all up to make room to feast

47
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,229
anew.

48
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,559
Vometoria are real but this idea of them is
not, though confusion is understandable because

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,149
their name -- Vomit-orium -- seems to make
their purpose so clear.

50
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,059
Even if for some reason you know latin -- perhaps
because you live in a country that insists

51
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,318
you waste hundreds of hours of your life learning
a dead, useless language -- this knowledge

52
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,339
still won't help you because the root word
'vomitum' means 'to spew forth'.

53
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,339
So what is it really?

54
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,099
If you've ever been to a big stadium, like
say, the ones made by the romans, you have

55
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,929
already used a vometorium.

56
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,129
This is what the vometoria are -- the passageways
that lets lots of people enter or exit at

57
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,129
once.

58
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,019
The people are what spews forth in the vometoria,
not the contents of the people.

59
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,019
1.

60
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,019
Columbus

61
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,829
There is so very much wrong with the common
retelling of the story of Christopher Columbus

62
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,739
that it's hard to know where to begin, but
the biggest misconception is that everyone

63
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,499
else thought the world was flat, but Columbus
was the only guy smart enough to know that

64
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,499
it's round.

65
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,889
It makes a daring story, but knowledge of
a spherical earth goes back to at least 5,000

66
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,749
BC that's six and a half thousand years before
Columbus set sail -- and that knowledge was

67
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,249
never lost to western civilization.

68
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,909
In 200 BC Eratosthenes calculated Earth's
circumference and his estimate was still well

69
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,439
know and being used in Columbus's time.

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,519
The argument Columbus had with queen Isabella
was not over the shape of the earth, but of

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,519
its size.

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,909
Columbus estimated the Earth was much smaller
than Queen Isabella and her scientific advisors

73
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,829
did which was way he thought he could make
it across the empty Atlantic to India.

74
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,519
But Columbus's size estimate was wrong -- again,
just like Napoleon's height -- because of

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,629
mixed up units.

76
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,429
However, his error did send him West to become
the first European to discover America -- as

77
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,960
long as you ignore the hornless vikings who
beat him by 500 years.
