1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,008
Pluto: Planet or not?

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,089
Before we can answer this question we need
to know what the word planet is for, and that

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,850
takes us back to the ancient greeks who called
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the

4
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:13,169
Moon and sun planets.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,929
Basically if it moved across the sky and was
bright, it was a planet.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,089
This is a terrible start for the word because,
1) it excludes Earth from the list and 2)

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,679
it groups wildly different things together.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,698
But the greeks couldn't know how different
the Moon was from Saturn, because the best

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,599
technology they had to observe the Universe
was sadly limited.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,429
It would take several thousand years until
the industrious Dutch made the first telescopes

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,238
and astronomy became much more interesting.

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,108
Astronomers could now confidently rearrange
the solar system -- an elegant scientific

13
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:43,259
advance that no one could possibly object
to -- and reclassify its parts, dropping the

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,888
Sun and moon from the list of planets and
adding Earth.

15
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:48,728
Now, if it orbited the Sun, it was a planet.

16
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:52,009
As time went on and telescopes got better
and better each new century brought with it

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,648
the discovery of a new planet.

18
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,639
Which brings us to this familiar solar system:
nine planets orbiting one star.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,318
And looking at this model makes people wonder,
why do astronomers want to ditch Pluto?

20
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,939
The problem is pictures like this in textbooks
are lies.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,379
Well, not lies exactly, but unhelpful.

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,889
They give the impression that the planets
are similar-ash in size and evenly-ish spaced,

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,919
but the reality couldn't be more different.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,269
Here, dear Terrans, is our home planet Earth,
and this is Jupiter next to it at the correct

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,019
scale -- rather bigger than you probably thought.

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,328
If we take this diagram and adjust for the
correct sizes of the planets it looks like

27
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:23,328
this.

28
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,658
Unless you're watching the video in fullscreen
HD mode, you might not even be able to see

29
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,658
Pluto.

30
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,989
So size differences are vast, and Pluto is
the smallest by far.

31
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,639
But it's not just small for a planet, it's
also smaller than seven moons: Triton, Europa,

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,179
our own Moon, Io, Callisto, Titan, and Ganymede.

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,469
Even if you show the correct relative sizes
the distances are still a problem.

34
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,398
Think about it, if Jupiter was this close
to Earth it wouldn't look like a dot in the

35
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,038
night's sky but would be rather overwhelming
-- so it must be really far away, which makes

36
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,158
drawing it to scale rather a challenge.

37
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,298
If you want the length of a piece of paper
to represent the distance from Mercury to

38
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,578
Pluto, then giant Jupiter would be the size
of a dust mite on that page, and Pluto a bacterium.

39
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,559
But excluding Pluto from the plant club just
for being tiny and far away isn't reason enough

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,658
and quickly brings out the Pluto defenders.

41
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,469
In order to understand what Pluto really is,
we need to first discuss a planet you've never

42
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,059
heard of: Ceres.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,119
Back in the 1801, astronomers found a new
planet in the huge gap between Mars and Jupiter

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,589
-- it was a small planet, but they loved it
anyway and named it Ceres.

45
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,529
The next year astronomers found another small
planet in the same area and named it Pallas.

46
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,238
A few years later they found a third one,
Juno, and then, funnily enough, a fourth one,

47
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,238
Vesta.

48
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,029
And for a several decades children learned
the 11 planets of the solar system.

49
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,299
But, astronomers kept finding more and more
of these objects and became increasingly uncomfortable

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,449
calling them planets because they were much
more like each other than planets the on either

51
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,759
side, so a new category was born: asteroids
in the asteroid belt -- and the tiny planets

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,408
were relabeled which is why you've never heard
of them.

53
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:51,009
And it was a good decision too, as astronomers
have now found hundreds of thousands of asteroids,

54
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,829
which would be a lot for a kid to memorize
if they were all still planets.

55
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,829
Back to Pluto.

56
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,888
It was discovered in 1930 making it the 9th
planet.

57
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,369
First estimates put Pluto about the size of
Neptune, but with more observations that was

58
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,629
revised down, and down and down.

59
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,098
While Pluto shrank astronomers started to
find other, similar objects orbiting in the

60
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,128
same zone.

61
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,319
Sound familiar?

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,709
While school kids kept memorizing the nine
planets, some astronomers grew uneasy about

63
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,219
including Pluto because the size estimates
continued to shrink, they learned that Pluto

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,128
is made mostly ice, and they continued to
find lots and lots of icy objects at the edge

65
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,298
of the solar system just like Pluto.

66
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,389
This problem could be ignored as long as no
one found an ice ball bigger than Pluto, which

67
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,129
is exactly what happened in 2006 with the
discovery of Eris.

68
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,879
Once again, astronomers recategorized the
solar system and grouped these distant objects,

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,429
including Pluto, into a new area called Kuiper
belt.

70
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,859
And that's the story of Pluto -- a miscategorized
planted that finally found its home -- just

71
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,099
like Ceres.

72
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,499
But this story is really less about Pluto
than it is about realizing the word 'planet'

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,908
isn't very helpful.

74
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,018
The first four planets are nothing at all
like the next four, so it's even a little

75
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,738
weird to group these eight together which
is why they often aren't and are separated

76
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,869
into terrestrial planets and gas giants.

77
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,099
And now that we have telescopes that can see
planets around stars not our own, and we've

78
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,988
found rogue planets drifting in empty space
and brown dwarfs -- objects that blur the

79
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,128
very line between planet and star -- the word
planet becomes even less clear.

80
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,759
So as we increase our knowledge of the Universe
the category of 'planet' will probably continue

81
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,648
to evolve, or possibly, fall out of favor
entirely.

82
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:22,069
But, for the time being the best way to categorize
the stuff in our solar system is into one

83
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,819
star, eight planets, four terrestrial, four
gas giants, the asteroid belt, and the distant

84
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,480
Kuiper belt, home to Plutoï¿½
