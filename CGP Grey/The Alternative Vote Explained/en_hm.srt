1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,539
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is displeased.
She recently introduced elections for the

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,409
office of king using the first post the post
voting system.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,569
While her Realm started out as a healthy democracy
with many parties running candidates for king,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,739
it quickly devolved into two party rule, with
the citizens not liking either one but trapped

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,039
within the system because of a problem called
the spoiler effect.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,238
However, one of Queen Lion’s subjects from
a distant land, Wallaby, has a solution: The

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,159
Alternative Vote.
What’s the difference?

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,319
To find out, lets follow one voter on election
day, Red Squirrel, under both systems.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,519
There are five candidates running for king,
two members of the big parties Gorilla and

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,049
Leopard and three other candidates, Turtle,
Owl and Tiger.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,219
Under first-past-the-post Red Squirrel gets
a ballot where he picks just one candidate.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,859
Red Squirrel Really likes Turtle and even
campaigned for him. However he knows that

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,779
his new neighbor, Grey Squirrel, is voting
Gorilla.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,569
And what, starts to wonder Red Squirrel, about
all the other animals? Who are they going

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,689
to vote for?
The debates on Animal News Network only had

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,499
the big parties, so Red Squirrel thinks it’s
going to be a close race between Gorilla and

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,679
Leopard.
While he’s indifferent toward Gorilla he

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,219
is deathly afraid of Leopard.
Because he can only pick a single candidate,

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,279
he gives his one vote to Gorilla in hopes
of preventing Leopard from becoming king.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,559
This is strategic voting, and it’s a necessity
under First Past the Post.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,590
But now it’s time to look at the Alternative
Vote, which wallaby explains to Red Squirrel.

22
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:22,449
Instead of picking one and only one candidate,
he can rank them in order of his most favorite

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,009
to his least.
He goes into the voting both and gets the

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,048
same ballot as before, but now puts Turtle
as his first choice, Owl as his second and

25
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,850
Gorilla, third.
He dislikes Leopard and Tiger equally so he

26
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,529
stops filling in his ballot and drops it in
the box.

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,459
At this point, Red Squirrel doesn’t care
exactly what happens, he has other things

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,389
on his mind and heads off. But you, dear citizen,
want to know how the votes are counted so

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,449
here goes:
Turtle, beloved though he is with some of

30
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,719
the citizenry, comes in last place with only
5% and he is eliminated from the race.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,139
Because the voters ranked their candidates
in order, we can know what would have happened

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,429
if Turtle didn’t run.
Without Turtle, voters like Red Squirrel,

33
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,059
would have picked Owl instead, so their votes
are transferred to her as though Turtle was

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,559
never in the race at all.
This is why Alternative Vote is sometimes

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,219
called Instant Runoff Voting. It’s able
to simulate a bunch of elections where the

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,689
least popular candidate is eliminated after
each round without all the time and expense

37
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,818
it would take to run a bunch of campaigns,
one after another.

38
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,918
The Alternative Vote method keeps eliminated
the least popular candidate until someone

39
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,908
either wins a majority or is the only one
left.

40
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:26,539
As no one has a majority yet, the next lowest
candidate, Tiger, is eliminated. Tiger voters

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,208
listed leopard as their second choice, so
she gets Tiger’s votes.

42
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,929
In the last round, Gorilla is eliminated.
Gorilla voters listed Owl as their second

43
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,558
choice, so Owl gets those votes, wins a majority,
so is crowed king.

44
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:42,120
The alternative vote is a better system because
it produces winners that a larger number of

45
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,438
voters agree on.
While the Alternative Vote does have flaws

46
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,429
it’s important to note that any problem
AV has, first past the post shares.

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,168
They’re both susceptible to gerrymandering,
they aren’t proportional systems, they can’t

48
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,619
guarantee a Condorcet winner (which math geeks
hate but there isn’t time to explain here),

49
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,528
and over time they both trend toward two main
parties.

50
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:05,238
That being said, Alternative Vote has a huge
advantage that first past the post lacks and

51
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,248
makes it a mathematically superior method:
no spoiler effect!

52
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:14,030
Imagine this election: the two big candidates
are running, Gorilla and Leopard, and Leopard

53
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:19,348
looks set to win 55% to 45%. But then a third
party candidate, Tiger, enters.

54
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:23,429
Tiger manages to convince 15% of the Leopard
voters to back him. Now the results are:

55
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,828
Under first past the post, gorilla now wins
even though a majority of the voters didn’t

56
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,988
want him.
Under the Alternative Vote, because all Tiger

57
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,039
voters put Leopard as second choice, Leopard
still wins because a majority of the citizens

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,558
of the animal kingdom would rather have her
in charge than gorilla.

59
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:42,938
With AV citizens can help support and grow
smaller parties that they agree without worrying

60
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,668
they’ll put someone they don’t like into
office.

61
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,838
After examining the differences, Queen Lion
decrees that the Alternative Vote is to be

62
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:55,298
the rule of the land for electing the king
and everyone is happier. …well almost everyone.

63
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:02,818
The two big parties can’t be complacent
and need to campaign harder for their votes.

64
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,848
This has been The Alternative Vote Explained
by me C. G. P. Grey.

65
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:06,809
Thank you very much for watching.
