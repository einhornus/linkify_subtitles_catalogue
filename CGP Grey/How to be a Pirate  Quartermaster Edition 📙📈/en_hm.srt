1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,909
(Recruit)
So how does this work exactly?

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,209
(Quartermaster)
If you'd like to be a pirate,

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,269
you need understand it is a business.

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,269
You can't have a crew or a ship

5
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,289
or a brand

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,289
without a business model to support them.

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,289
But pirate business is like any other.

8
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,369
Make a product or provide a service

9
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,369
to your customers in exchange for money.

10
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,019
Then spend that money on equipment and personnel

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,849
to make more product for more customers, for more money.

12
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,369
The difference with Piracy Incorporated is

13
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,279
our customers don't wish to be… serviced.

14
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,909
No matter.

15
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,559
With the correct spending on equipment and personnel,

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,379
the business will… service them regardless.

17
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,679
(Recruit)
[innocently]
Do you have to?

18
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,639
(Quartermaster)
My boy, if we don't service our 'customers',

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,899
someone else will.

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,479
And the reward for our abstemiousness will be poverty.

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,689
In our societal and technological environment,

22
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,769
an economic niche exists.

23
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,249
And this incorporation of pirates

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,099
fills its shape as whiskey fills a barrel.

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,999
Such is life.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,649
The motions we choose but the sum of forces upon us.

27
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,559
I became a pirate as the gold in this grail chose its form.

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,219
The both of us now cogs of this machine

29
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,969
that profits on the high seas or perishes.

30
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:07,969
(Recruit)
[uncertainly]
Okay.

31
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,169
(Quartermaster)
Profit is income minus expenses.

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,599
And for a pirate company,

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,699
income means seizing the biggest booty.

34
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,639
(Recruit)
[snickers]

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,979
(Quartermaster)
[sighs deeply]

36
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,759
Seizing the biggest treasure

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,689
while provoking the least cost-inducing resistance.

38
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,239
The Captain is… more than happy

39
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,789
to explain how we accomplish that through branding.

40
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,849
Branding built on the foundation of a solid business, mind you.

41
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,079
Brands are memorable and battles flashy.

42
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,989
But they don't happen without contracts and spreadsheets.

43
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,499
Thus, before we set sail,

44
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,499
there will be a contract for the voyage.

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,999
Though we choose not to live under the Empire's law,

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,999
we still have rules of our own.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,619
To which all men have input.

48
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,859
And to which all men must agree before setting sail.

49
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,459
The contract sets the voting methods, codes of conduct,

50
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,459
punishments for violating those codes,

51
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,609
distribution of pay, workman's compensation, etcetera.

52
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,019
Each pirate enterprise is a bit different.

53
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,019
But in general it works thusly.

54
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,779
There are two elected offices.

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,499
The captain and the quartermaster.

56
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,449
The captain is not our boss, but serves at the pleasure of the crew.

57
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,879
If they are unhappy with his strategic decisions,

58
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,679
the crew can replace him at any time by a majority vote.

59
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,999
There is no term length, with one exception.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,299
Battle is no time for democracy.

61
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,509
Amidst pandemonium, the decider must be free to decide.

62
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,779
But this is the only time the captain cannot be removed.

63
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,519
And, though our branding may give you the impression

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,319
the captain is in charge of all things,

65
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,549
the quartermaster keeps the ship running.

66
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,549
Overseeing the men, their quarters,

67
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,829
their rations, their agreed-upon privileges,

68
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,159
and punishments executed for contract violations.

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,389
Everything needed to keep the ship effective and profitable.

70
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,159
Quartermaster.  Battle master.  Crew.

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,239
Now, at the dawn of this new century,

72
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,289
a lot of men are qualified to be crew.

73
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,679
Which means the cost of their labor is low.

74
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,679
(Recruit)
So you're not going to pay me much?!

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,009
(Quartermaster)
You misunderstand.

76
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,919
That you are here tells me you're not

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,699
interested in traditional employment.

78
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,379
Working nine to five on a ship of the Empire for minimum wage.

79
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,839
Staying out of trouble and saving for retirement

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,159
as banal days pass eroding the dreams

81
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,099
and aspirations of your younger self.

82
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,309
Leaving you at the end to wonder how it all slipped away.

83
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,149
No, your personality matrix,

84
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,259
shaped entirely by your genetics and your environment,

85
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,329
tend you to engage in risk-taking.

86
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,409
(Recruit)
[confused]
What's genetics?

87
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,209
(Quartermaster)
[dismissively]
Doesn't matter.

88
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,079
Given your situation, you find being an outlaw

89
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,079
with the possibility of great riches

90
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,129
under the threat of the Empire's noose,

91
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,579
a risk worth considering.

92
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,609
If the riches are large enough, which they are.

93
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,429
As a crewmen on a pirate ship, you are not paid in wages,

94
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,189
but with one share of the profit.

95
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,569
Same as every crewmen.

96
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,739
The captain gets two shares for the strategic decisions he makes.

97
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,699
The quartermaster one and one half for his labors.

98
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,499
The surgeon, one and one fourth.

99
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,679
Same for the carpenter.

100
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,429
Though we do often have difficulty

101
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,099
finding surgeons with the right personality matrix.

102
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,889
So, if there is no surgeon, the carpenter will be surgeon.

103
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,029
Shocking, I know.

104
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,959
Such flat and equal compensation

105
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,759
is not what you'll find on Empire and merchant ships

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,419
where captains and officers are compensated richly

107
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,339
and get special quarters and privileges over the crew.

108
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,279
On a pirate ship, we are all equals achieving a common goal.

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,719
(Recruit)
Wow!  What great guys pirates are.

110
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,849
Such camaraderie!

111
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,589
(Quartermaster)
[as patiently as possible]
No.

112
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,789
This is not because we are better and the Empire worse.

113
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,078
But again, economic inevitability.

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,289
Empire and merchant ships are not owned by the men who sail them.

115
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,499
But by monarchs or investors who hire captains and officers to run them.

116
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,119
To ensure loyalty to the owners above crew,

117
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,539
the captain is not only paid much more,

118
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,689
but has a share in the ship's profits, which the men do not.

119
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,539
And may be granted titles and land upon his successful return.

120
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,599
Meanwhile, the crew, hired from the mass of men

121
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,959
with lives of quiet desperation and personalities matrices

122
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,849
constraining them inside the law, have only the low price

123
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,109
of their undifferentiated labor to offer.

124
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,219
And, being inside the law, their captains can threaten them

125
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,029
with corporal punishment on board,

126
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,499
with prison or treason off board.

127
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,659
Backed by the Empire and her resources

128
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,659
to track down traitors and deserters,

129
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,799
But for us pirates, captain's orders are but the words of one man.

130
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,099
Outside the law, a majority can take control at any time by force.

131
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,239
It is only our contract that eases this transition.

132
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,389
And, at every port, if a man trust not the contract or the crew,

133
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,519
he can just leave.

134
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,499
There is no pirate empire to track him down.

135
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,849
We have a ship and a business only by our cooperation.

136
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,309
And only if we can keep it.

137
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,689
But the incentive is great.

138
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,759
We are not here to sell our labor

139
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,649
to distant and disinterested owners.

140
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,399
But to taste the fruit of our labors directly.

141
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,259
To make money.

142
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,449
A lot of money, for all of us.

143
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,379
The only thing standing in our way

144
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,549
(aside from our customers occasionally)

145
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,249
is the subtractor of Costs.

146
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,699
If it grows too large, the business will inevitably dissolve.

147
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,149
And we won't get paid.

148
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,579
These costs come in mostly two forms.

149
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,579
Ship repairs and people repairs.

150
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,039
For the ship, the rules of supply and demand work against us.

151
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,609
We can't sail into a port of the Empire

152
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,059
seeking repairs without raising questions.

153
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,829
So we must only visit pirate-friendly ports,

154
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,799
with pirate-friendly dockworkers,

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,209
mostly far away in the New World.

156
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,589
Which raises repair costs considerably.

157
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,279
For pirates, each broken mast or cannon hole

158
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,609
is more costly than for the Empire.

159
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,699
So, for business reasons, we prefer not to fight.

160
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,239
Also fighting incurs personnel costs.

161
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,429
Since we know that some crew will be injured in battle.

162
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,209
Permanently.

163
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,939
And it's just a roll of the cosmic dice as to who and to what.

164
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,429
The contract we decide on lists generous compensation for

165
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,289
lost legs, arms, hands, eyes.

166
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,159
Thus after the… treasure is seized,

167
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,839
the injured are compensated, the ship is repaired,

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,129
supplies replenished.

169
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,919
The remainder is profit.

170
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,209
The glorious, glorious profit.

171
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,709
And your one share, after one successful voyage with us,

172
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,679
will be worth years of labor with the Empire.

173
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,679
So, are you compelled to join?

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
[merry hornpipe music]

175
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
(Recruit)
I'd like hear from the Captain.
