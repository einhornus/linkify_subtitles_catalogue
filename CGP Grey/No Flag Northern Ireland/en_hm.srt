1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
Poor no-flag Northern Ireland.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,239
While England Scotland and Wales all have flags,

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,059
as countries in the United Kingdom, not her.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,719
But rather than a transparent skirt of technical correctness,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,959
which would be weird,

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,459
BAM!

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,619
These videos use this flag that's often used to represent Northern Ireland in the real world.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,139
If it's good enough for sports, it's good enough for skorts.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,559
But why isn't this flag official, and why do some people prefer not to use it?

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,439
To discuss this, we must follow a narrow path through the forest of all knowledge.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,379
And be careful not to stray.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,819
It's easy to get lost in these woods, for there are always distractions and dangers to pull us aside.

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,439
Focus on the flag, don't leave the path.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,799
This flag is the Ulster banner named after Ulster, one of Ireland's traditional regions.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,999
The flag first flew above the Northern Irish parliament in 1953,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,979
as part of a visit by the then-newly-coronated queen.

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,859
But straight away, there was a bit of an asterisk, as, quote:

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:58,119
"The Minister of Home Affairs announced that while the Union flag was the only officially recognised standard those who wish to have a distinctive Ulster symbol might use the banner."

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,939
Which is a bit "Here's your new flag, but not really."

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,559
And the new flag wasn't new either,

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,959
designed in 1923 along with the Ulster coat of arms.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,759
Coat of arms are symbolic objects, so let's talk about the parts.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,299
The Irish elk represents the local Irish and the red lion represents the Ulster Scots.

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,459
Wait, why are there so many Scottish people in Northern Ireland to warrant half the coat of arms?

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,199
Have we wandered off the path?

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,879
The shield design is a red cross which is totally not at all

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,659
the St. George Cross England uses plus the crown of the UK and this red hand which is a

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,079
defining Northern Irish element as it's unique unlike the crown and the cross which are on everything.

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,389
The hand comes with a lady godiva style story about how the first to touch the land of Ulster would own it.

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,179
So, of course in the race someone cut off his own hand to win on technicality, which can't possibly be true

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,899
Not because people haven't been yelling "First! - technically." since the dawn of time

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,339
But because one: Have you ever tried to cut off your own hand? It's a lot harder than it sounds - and two:

33
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,659
While several important Northern Irish families claim creation of the hand the stories go back to

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,659
The 13th century where the paper trail runs cold

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,839
so let's spin the wheel of

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,519
historical claims and just say it was the O'Neill's because they're the easiest ones to pronounce and they're going to show up briefly later

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,089
From creation until now there's been debate about if the hand switched from a sinister version. No, seriously

38
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,609
That's what you're supposed to call the lefty version - to a righty version

39
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,659
But any flip-flop might just have been the whimsy of

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,289
Individual flag makers, same with the thumb position - which is all over the place

41
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,469
There wasn't exactly a vexillological standards board a thousand years ago keeping consistency

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,739
Anyway, sometime after the 1300s the hand of the...

43
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:31,719
O'Neil's was added to the symbol of another important Northern Irish family a red cross on a yellow background to form the Ulster coat of arms

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,759
Oh, it really is the St. George Cross.

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,459
Earlier sarcastic remark withdrawn.

46
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,439
The designer of the new arms and flag 400 years later changed the color for reasons no one knows.

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,959
The flag was then modified with a crown and a star and made sort of official from 1953 all the way until 1973

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,219
when the Northern Irish parliament ceased to exist during the Troubles

49
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,699
*gurgling screech from an ambush by The Troubles* [Music]

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,699
*face sucking noises* [Music]

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,099
[Music continues, brass crescendoes]

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,059
[decrescendo]

53
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,339
The troubles were - are? - an...

54
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,059
'Irregular conflict' around Northern Ireland

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,359
Is she part of Ireland or is she part of the United Kingdom?

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,459
The dispute started when Great Britain ...

57
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,159
'colonized' Northern Ireland, confiscating the land from local families such as the O'Neils.

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:23,419
With the goal to "pacify, civilize and develop the land" redistributing it to English and lots of Scottish settlers.

59
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,439
Oh, so that's why the lion is there.

60
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,219
So just like other places Great Britain ...

61
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,079
'colonized' there's a modern muddle of ownership and identity.

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,699
In these islands the conflicts build across them for so long that it's

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,019
represented in Ireland's flag with the white stripe being the hope for peace.

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,579
Huh.

65
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,799
Ireland's flag still uses the 2:1 ratio of former UK places rather than the more common 3:2 ratio of most flags.

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,279
Interesting: The US is a former UK place but it goes with a 10:19 ratio.

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
Very unusual!

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,839
Ah, we got pulled off the path. We need to get out of here

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,279
So though the flag is composed of traditional Northern Irish symbols (mostly)

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,259
it's not official because it never really was 100% and the government that used it doesn't exist.

71
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,299
And when the most divisive issue in your land is: Should it be part of a kingdom; having a crown on your flag

72
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,919
isn't exactly neutral and is also why there are periodic calls for a new Northern Irish flag.

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,799
But the power of flags is less about if they're official or not and much more about do people use them and do other people recognise them

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,700
And within these fair Isles it's fair to say that - at least currently - the flag is used and recognized.
