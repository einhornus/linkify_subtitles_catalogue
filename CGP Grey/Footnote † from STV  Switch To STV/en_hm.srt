1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,499
Imagine you're in charge of government

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,899
and you decide that it's time to take your existing jungle council

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,799
and you're going to switch it over to STV.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,499
One of the things that is an option is

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,499
because STV requires there to be more than one representative per range,

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,999
you can either triple, at a bare minimum

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,999
or quintuple the number of politicians you have,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,499
which might be something you want to do

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,799
but there many good reasons why you might not want to do that.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,099
Here's a more reasonable way

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,999
in which you actually switch over a country to STV.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,999
Here is a map of our current electoral ranges

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,999
each of which sends one representative.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,499
So, Step 1 is we're going to get rid of all these ranges

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,499
and we're going to redraw the boundaries.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,799
So instead of everybody getting elected from one range

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,499
we're going to draw ranges that have five representatives in each.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,299
Now, if local representation means anything

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,999
you're probably going to want to try draw these boundaries

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,999
in meaningful ways in your country.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,999
So, they follow natural boundaries,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,499
or they follow town boundaries, or historical boundaries..

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,499
you're going to want to try to match those as close as you reasonably can.

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,799
But an important thing to realize

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,399
is that you do not have to have all of the ranges

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,999
be the exact same size in terms of representatives.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,999
So, in the bottom corner of the map over here

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,999
you can see we have a kind of "animal city."

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,999
And so what you can do is

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,799
instead of trying to divide that up into

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,299
a bunch of 5 representative ranges

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,999
you can take it and say "No we're just going to cut it into two."

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,999
There's the north half of the city, and the south half of the city

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,499
and that's two ranges with nine representatives each.

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,799
Now you may be asking "Why don't you just make it one range with 18 representatives?"

36
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,999
The answer is there's a kind of trade-off for making larger ranges

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,039
The larger the range is that you have a benefit

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,999
in that it is going to be more representative of the local population.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,399
So, in theory, a range with 40 or 50 representatives

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,799
would be even better than a range with just, say, five.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,799
But the price you pay for a bigger range

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,799
is a more complicated election

43
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,999
because if there are, say, nine seats open

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,599
you're probably going to have at least twenty candidates running

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,499
So if you actually have a range that has eighteen seats available

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,999
you're probably looking at an election that that's going to have 40 or 50 candidates

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,499
which is a little bit beyond what you can expect a reasonable person to be able to distinguish among.

48
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,299
Even eighteen is getting a bit up there

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,999
which is why reasonable STV systems allow you to just list your favorites

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,999
as far as you care to go. Say 1-5.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,999
And then just not fill in the ballot anymore because you don't care anymore

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,499
Now the flipside to this problem is when you have a very sparsely populated region

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,499
as we have in the upper left here.

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,499
Many countries have their own version of fly-over regions

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,999
where the population is widely, widely distributed and very thin.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,399
In that case, trying to draw a range that had five representatives might just be comically large,

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,499
so big as to just make a mockery of the very notion

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,999
that these representatives are "local", in any sense of that word.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,999
So if you have a very sparsely populated region

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,999
you can have a smaller range as well.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,499
So in this case we're going to make one range with three representatives in the corner.

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,999
Now, as before, the advantage you get with a smaller election

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,999
is that it is easier to follow - there are going to be fewer candidates running.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,499
However, smaller ranges are much more susceptible to intentional gerrymandering

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,499
and three is at about that number.

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,999
If your country is switching over to Single Transferrable Vote

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,999
and it wants to make all of the ranges three

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,999
you should be very suspicious because three is gerrymander-able.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,199
It is going less proportionate than a larger range.

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,999
It is acceptable under certain, reasonable circumstances

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,999
but it definitely shouldn't be the standard.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Five should really be the minimum, and nine should probably be the maximum.
