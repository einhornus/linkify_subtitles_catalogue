1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,769
Where, is the European Union?

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,449
Obviously here somewhere, but much like the
the European continent itself, which has an

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,129
unclear boundary, the European Union also
has some fuzzy edges to it.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,079
To start, the official members of the European
Union are, in decreasing order of population:

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,079
* Germany
* France

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,079
* The United Kingdom
* Italy

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,078
* Spain
* Poland

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,079
* Romania
* The Kingdom of the Netherlands

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,079
* Greece
* Belgium

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,079
* Portugal
* The Czech Republic

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,079
* Hungary
* Sweden

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,079
* Austria
* Bulgaria

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,079
* Denmark
* Slovakia

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,079
* Finland
* Ireland

15
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,079
* Croatia
* Lithuania

16
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,079
* Latvia
* Slovenia

17
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,079
* Estonia
* Cyprus

18
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,079
* Luxembourg
* Malta

19
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,879
The edges of the EU will probably continue
to expand further out as there are other countries

20
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,589
in various stages of trying to become a member.

21
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,409
How exactly the European Union works is hideously
complicated and a story for another time,

22
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,209
but for this video you need know only three
things:

23
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,209
1.

24
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,299
Countries pay membership dues and

25
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,299
2.

26
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,489
Vote on laws they all must follow and

27
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,489
3.

28
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,919
Citizens of member countries are automatically
European Union citizens as well

29
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,719
This last means that if you're a citizen of
any of these countries you are free to live

30
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,919
and work or retire in any of the others.

31
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,649
Which is nice especially if you think your
country is too big or too small or too hot

32
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,649
or too cold.

33
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,129
The European Union gives you options.

34
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,619
By the way, did you notice how all three of
these statements have asterisks attached to

35
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,717
this unhelpful footnote?

36
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:10,019
Well, get used to it: Europe loves asterisks
that add exceptions to complicated agreements.

37
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,629
These three, for example, point us toward
the first bit of border fuzziness with Norway,

38
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,118
Iceland and little Liechtenstein.

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,199
None of which are in the European Union but
if you're a EU citizen you can live in these

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,949
countries and Norwegians, Icelanders, or Liechtensteiner(in)s
can can live in yours.

41
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,949
Why?

42
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,939
In exchange for the freedom of movement of
people they have to pay membership fees to

43
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,478
the European Union -- even though they aren't
a part of it and thus don't get a say its

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,478
laws that they still have to follow.

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,349
This arrangement is the European Economic
Area and it sounds like a terrible deal, were

46
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,169
it not for that asterisk which grants EEA
but not EU members a pass on some areas of

47
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,658
law notably farming and fishing -- something
a country like Iceland might care quite a

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,519
lot about running their own way.

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,259
Between the European Union and the European
Economic Area the continent looks mostly covered,

50
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,528
with the notable exception of Switzerland
who remains neutral and fiercely independent,

51
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,688
except for her participation in the Schengen
Area.

52
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,248
If you're from a country that keeps her borders
extremely clean and / or well-patrolled, the

53
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:04,919
Schengen Area is a bit mind-blowing because
it's an agreement between countries to take

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,848
a 'meh' approach to borders.

55
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:10,939
In the Schengen Area international boundaries
look like this: no border officers or passport

56
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,229
checks of any kind.

57
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,429
You can walk from Lisbon to Tallinn without
identification or need to answer the question:

58
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,439
"business or pleasure?".

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,489
For Switzerland being part of Schengen but
not part of the European Union means that

60
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,709
non-swiss can check in any time they like,
but they can never stay.

61
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,619
This koombaya approach to borders isn't appreciated
by everyone in the EU: most loudly, the United

62
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,569
Kingdom and Ireland who argue that islands
are different.

63
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,419
Thus to get onto these fair isles, you'll
need a passport and a good reason.

64
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,939
Britannia's reluctance to get fully involved
with the EU brings us to the next topic: money.

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,039
The European Union has its own fancy currency,
the Euro used by the majority, but not all

66
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,649
of the European Union members.

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,359
This economic union is called the Eurozone
and to join a country must first reach certain

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,499
financial goals -- and lying about reaching
those goals is certainly not something anyone

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,539
would do.

70
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,649
Most of the non-Eurozone members when they
meet the goals, will ditch their local currency

71
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,889
in favor of the Euro but three of them Denmark,
Sweden and, of course, the United Kingdom,

72
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,819
have asterisks attracted to the Euro sections
of the treaty giving them a permanent out-out.

73
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,159
And weirdly, four tiny European countries
Andorra, San Marino, Monaco & Vatican City

74
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,269
have an asterisk giving them the reverse:
the right print and use Euros as their money,

75
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,529
despite not being in the European Union at
all.

76
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,209
So that's the big picture: there's the EU,
which makes all the rules, the Eurozone inside

77
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,439
it with a common currency, the European Economic
Area outside of it where people can move freely

78
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,559
and the selective Schengen, for countries
who think borders just aren't worth the hassle.

79
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,789
As you can see, there's some strange overlaps
with these borders, but we're not done talking

80
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,489
about complications by a long shot one again,
because empire.

81
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,909
So Portugal and Spain have islands from their
colonial days that they've never parted with:

82
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,199
these are the Madeira and Canary Islands are
off the coast of Africa and the Azores well

83
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,489
into the Atlantic.

84
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,759
Because these islands are Spanish and Portuguese
they're part of the European Union as well.

85
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,529
Adding a few islands to the EU's borders isn't
a big deal until you consider France: the

86
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,609
queen of not-letting go.

87
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,179
She still holds onto a bunch of islands in
the Caribbean, Reunion off the coast of Madagascar

88
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,389
and French Guiana in South America.

89
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,359
As far as France is concerned, these are France
too, which single handedly extends the edge-to-edge

90
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,399
distance of the European Union across a third
of Earth's circumference.

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,429
Collectively, these bits of France, Spain
and Portugal are called the Outermost Regions

92
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,939
-- and they're the result of the simple answer
to empire: just keep it.

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,009
On the other hand, there's the United Kingdom,
the master of maintaining complicated relationships

94
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,489
with her quasi-former lands -- and she's by
no means alone in this on such an empire-happy

95
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,489
continent.

96
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,569
The Netherlands and Denmark and France (again)
all have what the European Union calls Overseas

97
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,239
Territories: they're not part of the European
Union, instead they're a bottomless well of

98
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,309
asterisks due to their complicated relationships
with both with the European Union and their

99
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,719
associated countries which makes it hard to
say anything meaningful about them as a group

100
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,719
but...

101
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,899
in general European Union law doesn't apply
to these places, though in general the people

102
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,099
who live there are European Union citizens
because in general they have the citizenship

103
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,189
of their associated country, so in general
they can live anywhere in the EU they want

104
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,059
but in general other European Union citizens
can't freely move to these territories.

105
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,439
Which makes these places a weird, semipermeable
membrane of the European Union proper and

106
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,409
the final part we're going to talk about in
detail even though there are still many, more

107
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,959
one-off asterisks you might stumble upon,
such as: the Isle of Man or those Spanish

108
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,939
Cities in North Africa or Gibraltar, who pretends
to be part of Southwest England sometimes,

109
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,339
or that region in Greece where it's totally
legal to ban women, or Saba & friends who

110
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,209
are part of the Netherlands and so should
be part of the EU, but aren't, or the Faeroe

111
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,509
Islands upon which while citizens of Denmark
live they lose their EU citizenship, and on

112
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,859
and on it goes.

113
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,860
These asterisks almost never end, but this
video must.
