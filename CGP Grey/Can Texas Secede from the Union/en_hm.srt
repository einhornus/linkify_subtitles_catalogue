1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:03,649
Can Texas Secede from the Union?

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,339
America's second most populated and second
largest state is always first to remind you

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,338
that it was once an independent nation: The
Republic of Texas.

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,378
Unlike California's three-week, almost accidental
flirt with independence (and a hideous flag)

5
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:19,629
the Republic of Texas was a real country with
its own presidents, and laws and currency

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,598
for a decade from 1836 until 1846 when it
joined the Union to become the 28th state,

7
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,129
thankfully evening out the number of stars.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,299
This happy marriage led pretty much immediately
to the Mexican-American war over the question

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,099
of over how big Texas was.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,849
America, as the victor, got to decide the
answer: very big.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,919
While Texas gave up its complete independence
to join The Union, it didn't give up its independent

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,648
streak -- and filed for divorce, along with
several other states, a scant 15 years later.

13
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:52,039
This domestic dispute was settled not with
flowers but with force, something that many

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,209
are still grumbly about today.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,218
But History aside in modern times could Texas
still be a real country?

16
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,259
In other words: could Texas succeed if it
secedes?

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,259
In terms of population, an independent Texas
would be the world's 46th largest country

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,089
with 26 million citizens.

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,619
And, those citizens would make Texas the 13th
largest economy.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,619
So the New Texas Republic would be comparable
to Australia, except in the size department.

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,089
But what about the Federal money that goes
to Texas?

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,509
Those interstate highways don't build themselves,
you know.

23
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,579
For a majority of states, independence would
be a financial problem.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,069
Mississippi, for example get two dollars from
Washington for every one it sends in taxes

25
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,359
so an independent Magnolia Republic would
be bankrupt almost instantly.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,669
But not Texas, which gives more money to the
federal government in taxes than it gets back.

27
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,249
There's no reason why independent Texas couldn't
keep those highways paved *and* give its citizens

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,919
a small happy-Texapendency-day Tax cut.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,389
So from a financial perspective: The New Texas
Republic gets a check.

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,949
Now the question is can Texas legally secede?

31
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,219
And the answer is... no... not at all.

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,859
Despite popular belief, even by politicians
who should know better, the Texas constitution

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,199
does not include a get-out-of-The-Union-free
clause no matter how much Texans, or citizens

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,859
of other states, wish that it did.

35
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,609
However, the Texas Constitution does have
a weird clause that allows it to divide itself

36
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,239
into five states without the approval of congress.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,869
So Texas could, any moment, explode into the
states perhaps named North Texas, South Texas,

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,119
East Texas, West Texas and Austin -- which
would quintuple its power in the Senate -- but

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,619
not necessarily help it gain independence
because there is no legal process for a state

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,949
to exit The Union.

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,439
Though the constitution is mute on the issue,
secession has come before the supreme court

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,339
and, shockingly, the Supreme Court of the
United States decided that States can't leave

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,378
the United States.

44
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,559
But the legal question is, weirdly sort of
moot.

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,419
After all, the First Texas Republic didn't
pop into existence out of nowhere -- Texas

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,179
was originally a State of Mexico, which didn't
allow Texas to leave, but leave Texas did

47
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,968
anyway, though under less than harmonious
circumstances.

48
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,679
While it's hard to imagine war between the
New Texas Republic and the United States it

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,729
isn't hard to imagine who would win that fight.

50
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,019
Texas does have its own military, but seriously,
nobody beats America in the war business.

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,119
So the only way Texas is leaving is if it
can convince the United States to change its

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,498
laws to let it leave.

53
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:10,749
Which only as a chance of being discussed
seriously if a majority of Texans want independence,

54
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,449
which isn't remotely the case.

55
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,298
So while a New Texas Republic is interesting
to think about -- particularly for some non-Texans,

56
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,360
as of now it's a long way from becoming a
reality.
