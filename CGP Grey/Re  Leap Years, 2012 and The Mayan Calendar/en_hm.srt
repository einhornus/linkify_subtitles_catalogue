Hello, Internet.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,129
A lot of you sent me this image making the
rounds which concerns the Mayan prediction

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,699
that the world will end on December 21, 2012.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,598
The claim is that the Mayan calendar short
counted the years because they forgot about

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,968
leap days so the world should have already
ended.

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,958
This is followed by Mind = Blown, which I'm
not sure how to take.

7
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,499
Do people think that the world forgot to have
its apocalypse or that were it not for leap

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,499
days that we'd already be living in the future?

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,739
Either way, it's spawned many an argument
that people ask me to explain, which I'm happy

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,339
to do, because my next big video was delayed
by pestilence, which struck me down into the

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,749
depths of unproductive misery for the last
few weeks.

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,089
So, if you haven't already, please watch the
related videos now as otherwise this won't

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,979
make a whole lot of sense and there are a
few corrections I'd like to make.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,979
The first of these is that I shouldn't have
called the Mayans "Mayans".

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,079
Maya is the correct singular and plural noun
to use in the same way that sheep is both

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,549
singular and plural.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,599
Mayan is the name of the language and the
adjective form of the word as in the Mayan

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,599
civilization.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,759
Secondly, I showed a picture of the Aztec
calendar stone, rather than a Mayan calendar

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,439
in my 2012 video, which at the time I thought
was okay because the Aztec calendar is the

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,148
same as the Mayan, just with different names,
sort of like the Greek and Roman Gods.

22
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,789
And, frankly, the Aztec one is much cooler
looking.

23
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,219
But I was still wrong to show it because despite
naming it the Aztec calendar stone, archeologists

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,949
don't actually think it's a calendar.

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,889
And, speaking of stone, I used the term Stone
Age to describe the Maya which made many people

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,889
very angry.

27
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,499
For clarity, Stone Age does not mean stupid,
it's the technological classification of a

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,709
civilization limited to stone tools.

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,949
Advanced though their astronomy and mathematics
were, the Maya never discovered metallurgy

30
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,679
and thus couldn't move on to the Bronze Age
then the Iron Age then the Diamond Age.

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,679
Right.

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,679
Enough corrections.

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,530
It's explanation time for this image which
raised three questions: 1) Does the Mayan

34
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:30,589
calendar have leap days?

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,579
2) Did the Maya miscount the years, 3) Should
the world have already ended?

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,379
The answer to all of these is, no.

37
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,589
To briefly recap, leap years exist to stop
seasons from drifting out of sync with the

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,809
calendar, a problem that vexed Pope Gregory
because every year Easter and spring were

39
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,279
getting further apart.

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,609
To fix this, he introduced the modestly named
Gregorian calendar with its fancy leap year

41
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,989
rules to keep the seasons and thus the holidays
together.

42
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,478
But, while Pope Gregory cared about the seasons,
the ancient Maya did not.

43
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,769
Presumably because where they lived the weather
comes in only one season, too hot and too

44
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,769
humid.

45
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,720
So the Mayan calendar ignores seasons in favor
of accurately tracking the days since the

46
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,379
creation of the Mayan religion.

47
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,879
This renders leaps years an unnecessary complication.

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,168
Though the Mayan calendar is no stranger to
complication with its cycles within cycles

49
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,669
within cycles within cycles within cycles
that, if you're interested, Hank Green can

50
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,339
tell you much more about.

51
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,539
But back to the miscounting claims which comes
from our idea that leap days are extra days

52
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,159
which, of course, they really aren't.

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,479
The Gregorian calendar doesn't give people
extra days any more than daylight saving time

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,059
gives people extra sunlight.

55
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,749
If you transported Pope Gregory 1,000 years
back in time to meet the Mayan Lady Xoc and

56
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,929
then made them count the days until this year's
winter solstice, they'd agree on that number

57
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,429
because they're just counting sunrises.

58
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,619
It's not like Pope Gregory with his clever
modern calendar would notice 500+ days that

59
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,369
the Lady Xoc somehow missed, perhaps while
distracted by the pain from her thorns through

60
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,479
the tongue routine.

61
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,469
The only thing that they would disagree on
is what to call that day with Pope Gregory

62
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,749
insisting on December 21, 2012 and Lady Xoc
preferring the 13th Baktun.

63
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,089
So, this image is wrong because it's an apples
to oranges comparison.

64
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,899
The Mayan calendar doesn't have leap days
because it doesn't need them.

65
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,129
It counts days just fine and its long cycle
will finish on December 21, 2012, but the

66
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,310
world will still go on.
