00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,979
Good morning, internet.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,879
I came out here to write and to research, and to think about the channel and its evolution.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,319
The Staten Island video, for example, started life as part of the background reading…

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,019
… for the Statue of Liberty video.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,519
Originally planned to be just a small footnote a couple weeks later, I got a little ...

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,019
… obsessed with the story of Christopher Billopp.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,719
And that small footnote took one year and two transatlantic flights to finish.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,559
That's a lot.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,219
To cover costs, I should have put an ad at the end of it.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,899
But, I just don't think that would have worked creatively for the project.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,199
Think about it.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,499
Instead of leaving Past Grey in the cemetery, alone, soaking wet, and frankly half-crazed…

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,859
To end on "This video was brought to you by..."?

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,979
I couldn't do it.

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,159
And it was much the same with the Road Trip video.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,839
That was a real transformative life event for me…

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,119
… and the project became such a difficult technical nightmare…

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,479
… over three summers to finish that by the time it was done, it was just too personal.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,519
So, coming here and thinking about the videos I've been working on…

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,219
… and looking at my plans for future videos, I see a lot of projects like those.

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,579
Projects that don't make financial sense without a sponsor,…

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,699
… and that don't make creative sense with one.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,139
So...I'm here to ask if I can double-down on you.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,699
You, the viewer who watches and really likes the kind of thing I make.

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,759
If that's you, consider supporting the channel directly on Patreon.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,059
Unless you're in school, of course.

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,839
Students are forbidden from donating.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,519
Your job is to work on you and make yourself an independent person in the world,…

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,119
… which is a hard enough task that should require all of your attention and resources.

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,999
Focus on that. I'll catch you later.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,639
For everyone else, there's no pressure or obligation here.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,179
I only want patrons to support my work who are happy and able to do so.

33
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,859
If you can't, we're good!

34
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,099
Just watching is support.

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,939
Anyway, I think you can see now why sometimes things take a while.

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,539
We all like to joke about how long it is between Grey uploads.

37
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,859
I see you in the comments.

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,219
I like to make those jokes!

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,299
I wouldn't want to live on an internet without recurring memes.

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,879
But, it's important for me for *you* to know that this channel is the creative core of my life.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,519
It's my full-time work.

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,779
(... sometimes to the point of real madness)

43
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,739
Anyway, thank you for watching.

44
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,559
Consider giving on Patreon.

45
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,659
And now, I've got some scripts I'm gonna go work on.

46
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,419
I'll see you later, internet.

47
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,440
Have a great day.
