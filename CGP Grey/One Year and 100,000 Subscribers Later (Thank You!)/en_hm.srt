One year ago today I uploaded a video to YouTube about the difference between the UK, Great Britain and England.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,999
At the time of the upload I've been living in London for about 8 years. And, while, I understood the basics of this foreign land...

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,999
I still had questions niggling at the back of my mind about all the other little pieces.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,999
Such as the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. Who weren't exactly part of the UK, but were still somehow british.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,999
One day while buying cream for my wife's coffee, I was confronted with this: 'Jersey Cows'.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,999
And could no longer contain my irritation of my own ignorance. 'What are you Jersey Cows?' I wondered.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,999
And why is the Union Jack on here if you're not part of the UK?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,999
I went home to sort this out for once and all and, what I expected would take ten minutes...

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,999
But, as so often is the case when your starting point is the Wikipedia,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,999
Ended up becoming a research project involving dozens of hours

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,999
To not feel like I completely wasted my time, I turned it into the video I eventually uploaded to YouTube. 

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,999
I asked some locals what they thought and soon was attacked by the monster of viral videos.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,999
Fast-forward to today and I now find myself in the odd position of being a socially reclusive guy...

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,999
Followed by a 100,000+ people, whose videos have been seen more than 10 million times.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,999
Which is more than a bit overwhelming if I think about it too much.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,999
But I want to say a huge 'Thank you' to each and every one of you.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,999
Not personally of course as reading 100,000+ names at 1 second each would take about 28 hours.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,999
But a general thank you - thank you so much for subscribing, watching and sharing my videos.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,999
I also want to thank some YouTubers who've helped me along the way...

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,999
Including MinutePhysics, the VlogBrothers, Phil DeFranco - who, in a single week tripled my subscribers.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,999
And in particular I want to thank Michael from VSauce, who was nice enough to meet up with me...

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,999
...in the physical world at the London Googleplex, which, getting to see the inside of made me feel 20% cooler,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,999
...where he encouraged me to make videos on a more regular schedule.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,999
You, dear viewer, may know 1 or more of these guys but please subscribe to them all and encourage YouTube cross-pollination.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,999
I don't know exactly where this channel is going to go in the future, but its been an interesting ride so far.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,999
And, if you stay with me, I sincerely hope to keep making more stuff that you'll like.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thanks again to all 100,000 of you!
