1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,239
Do you want to rule?  Do you see the problems in your country and know how to fix them?

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,819
If only you had the power to do so.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,959
Well, you've come to the right place.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,479
But before we begin this lesson in political power, ask yourself why don't rulers see as clearly as you...

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,879
...instead acting in such, selfish, self-destructive, short-sighted ways?

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,839
Are they stupid… these most powerful people in the world?

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,479
Or is it something else?

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,839
The throne looks omnipotent from afar, but it is not as it seems.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,199
Take the throne to act, and the throne acts upon you.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,639
Accept that or turn back now before we discuss, the Rules for Rulers.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,799
*somber music*

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,359
No matter how bright the rays of any sun king: No man rules alone.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,839
A king can’t build roads alone, can’t enforce laws alone, can't defend the nation or himself, alone.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,399
The power of a king is not to act, but to get others to act on his behalf, using the treasure in his vaults.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,959
A king needs an army, and someone to run it.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,839
Treasure and someone to collect it.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,279
Law and someone to enforce it.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,439
The individuals needed to make the necessary things happen are the king's keys to power.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:24,639
All the changes you wish to make are but thoughts in your head if the keys will not follow your commands.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,079
In a dictatorship, where might makes right, the number of keys to power is small, ...

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,519
...perhaps only a dozen generals, bureaucrats, and regional leaders.

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,239
Sway them to your side and the power to rule is yours, but...

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,819
...never forget: displease them and they will replace you.

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:48,639
Now all countries lie on a spectrum from those where the ruler needs few key supporters to those where the ruler needs many...

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,159
...this foundation of power is why countries are different.

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,519
Yet many keys or few, the rules are the same:

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,399
First, get the key supporters on your side.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,999
With them, you have the power to act; you have everything.  Without them, you have nothing.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,279
Now in order to keep those keys to power, you must, second:

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,199
Control the treasure.

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,919
You must make sure your treasure is raised and distributed to you -- for all your hard work

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,119
-- and to the keys needed to keep your position.

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,239
This is your true work as a ruler: figuring out how best to raise and distribute resources,

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,639
...so as not to topple the house of cards upon which your throne sits.

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,399
Now you, aspiring benevolent dictator, may want to help your citizens,...

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,719
...but your control of the treasure is what attracts rivals, so you must keep those keys loyal.

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,479
But there is only so much treasure in your vaults, so much wealth your kingdom produces.

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,879
So beware: every bit of treasure spent on citizens is treasure not spent on loyalty.

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,999
Thus, doing the right thing, spending the wealth of the nation on the citizens of the nation,...

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
...hands a tool of power acquisition to your rivals.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:12,479
Treasure poured into roads, and universities, and hospitals, is treasure a rival can promise to key supporters if only they switch sides.

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,119
Benevolent dictators can spend their take on the citizens, but the keys must get their rewards,...

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:28,279
for *even if* you have gathered the most loyal, angelic supporters, they have the same problem as you, just one level down...

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,959
Being a key to power is a position of power.

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:41,239
They too must watch out for rivals from below or above: thus the treasure they get must also be spent to maintain their position.

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,759
The loyal and dim may stay by your side no matter what,...

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:55,279
...but smart key supporters, will always watch the balance of power, ready to change allegiance if you look to be the loser in a shifting web of alliances.

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,039
In countries where the keys are few, the rewards are great...

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,679
...and when violence rules, the most ruthless are attracted; and angels that build good works will lose to devils that don't.

50
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:14,439
So buy all the loyalty you can, because loyalty, in dictatorial organizations of all kinds, is everything.

51
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,278
For the ruler, anyway.

52
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,199
Thus, the dictatorship exposed:

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,399
A king who needs his court to raise the treasure to keep the court loyal and keep raising the treasure.

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,079
This is the self-sustaining core of power, all outside is secondary.

55
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,559
Now a king with many key supporters has real problems:

56
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,839
not just their expense, but also their competing needs and rivalries are difficult to balance,...

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,559
...the more complicated the social and financial web between them all, the more able a rival is to sway a critical mass.

58
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,519
The more key supporters a ruler has on average, the shorter their reign.

59
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,839
Which brings us to the third rule for rulers:

60
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,119
Minimize Key Supporters

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,479
If a key in your court becomes unnecessary, his skills no longer required, you must kick him out.

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,999
After a successful coup,  the new dictator will purge some of those who helped him come to power,...

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,479
... while working with the underlings of the previous dictator -- which from the outside seems a terrible idea.

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,239
Why abandon your fellow revolutionaries?

65
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,959
Are the old dictator's supporters not a danger?

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,159
But the keys necessary to gain power are not the same as those needed to keep it.

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:38,519
Having someone on the payroll who was vital in the past, but useless now is the same as spending money on the citizens: treasure wasted on the irrelevant.

68
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,399
And by definition, a dictator that pulls off a coup has promised greater treasure to those switching sides.

69
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,399
The size of the vault has not changed, so the treasure must be split among fewer.

70
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:00,719
A dictator that sways the right keys, takes control of the treasure, cuts unnecessary spending, kills unnecessary keys, will have a long and successful career.

71
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,519
Seeing the structure unveiled, you might be excited to get started and control a country to the benefit of you and your cronies,...

72
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:17,439
...or you might be exhausted, wishing to do good but seeing the structural difficulties, now turn to democracy for salvation.

73
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,159
So let us discuss rulers as representatives.

74
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,959
You again might have grand dreams of the utopia you wish to build, but: no man rules alone.

75
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,799
And never more so than in democracy.

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,799
Presidents and Prime ministers must negotiate with their senates and parliaments and vice versa.

77
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,439
And they all have their own key supporters to manage.

78
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,319
In a well-designed democracy, power is fractured among many, and is taken not with force but with words,…

79
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,159
… meaning you must get thousands or millions of citizens to if not like you on election day, …

80
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,119
…at least like you better than the alternative.

81
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,159
With so many voters and such fractured power it's impossible to, as a dictator would,…

82
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,599
…follow these rules and buy loyalty.  Or is it?

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,559
Of course not.

84
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,279
Don't think of citizens as individuals with their individual desires, but instead as divided into blocs:

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,519
…the elderly, or homeowners, or business owners, or the poor.  Blocs you can reward as a group.

86
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,759
Democracies have wildly complicated tax codes, and laws, not as accident but as reward

87
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,239
for the blocks that get and keep the ruling representatives in power:

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,279
Farming subsidies, for example, have nothing to do with the food a nation needs, ...

89
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,999
...but entirely with how key the vote of the farming bloc is.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,399
Countries where farmers’ votes don't swing elections, don’t have farming subsidies.

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,919
If a bloc doesn’t vote, such as younger citizens, then no need to divert rewards their way.

92
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,199
Even if large in number, they are irrelevant to gaining power.

93
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,959
Which is good news for you: one less block to sway and the treasure you give to your key blocks has to come from somewhere...

94
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,119
If you want long years in office, rule three is your friend in a democracy just as much as a dictatorship.

95
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,279
You can't eliminate those who don’t vote for you, but there is still much you can do.

96
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,479
Once in power, make it easier for your key blocks to vote and harder for others.

97
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,799
Establish voting systems that reduce the number of blocs you need to win the more rivals you get,…

98
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,079
…very handy indeed.

99
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,519
Draw election borders to predetermine the results for you or your cronies, …

100
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,678
…and have party pre-elections with Byzantine rules to determine who blocs even *can* vote for.

101
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,879
Mix and match the above for even better power perpetuation.

102
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,399
When approval ratings couldn't be lower, yet re-election rates couldn't be higher,…

103
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,879
… you'll know you've succeeded.

104
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,759
Now, enough with thinking about the citizens.

105
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,239
Even in a democracy there still are very influential individual key supporters

106
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,359
...you need on your side because their money or influence or favors keeps you in power.

107
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,279
While you can’t just promise to give them treasure directly, as a dictator would,…

108
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,319
…you can create loopholes for their investments, pass laws that they’ve written, …

109
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,239
… or print get out of jail free cards for their actions.

110
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,679
Not a wheelbarrow of gold to the door, but contracts for their business.

111
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,599
You as ruler do have roads to build or computers to maintain or buildings to reconstruct.

112
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,039
No man rules alone, after all.

113
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,119
Or you could take the moral path, and ignore the big keys.

114
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,759
But you'll fight against those who didn't.  Good luck with that.

115
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,079
Corruption is not some kind of petty crime, but rather a tool of power, …

116
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,159
…in democracies and dictatorships, but more on that another time.

117
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,199
So, accept the favors, sway the key blocs and you will get into power, …

118
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,039
… ruling with actions that look contradictory and stupid to those who don't understand the game —

119
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,519
privately helping a powerful industry you publicly denounced, …

120
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,599
… or passing laws that hurt a bloc that voted for you.

121
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,039
But your job isn’t to have a consistent understandable ruling policy, …

122
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,999
… but to balance the interests of your keys to power, big and small.

123
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,959
That is how you stay in office.

124
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,199
Now with all this headache of being a representative, you may wonder,…

125
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,239
… looking at rule three why couldn’t you skip all this bloc-building, favor trading nonsense …

126
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,079
… and just bribe the army to take power?

127
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,679
We must finally turn to: taxes and revolts.

128
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,759
You must understand rule  two and how the treasure is raised and used to hold a country together.

129
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,799
If we graph the tax rate of countries vs the number of key supporters the ruler needs, …

130
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,359
… there’s a clear relationship.  More democracy, lower taxes.\

131
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,599
If you're sitting comfortably in a cushy democracy you may scoff at this, …

132
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,439
… but your fellow citizens who don’t earn enough don’t pay income taxes and get rebates, …

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,599
… bringing the *average* tax rate down.  In dictatorships, this doesn’t happen.

134
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,679
Dictatorships often forgo tax paperwork in favor of just taking wealth directly.

135
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,399
It’s common for the dictator to force farmers to sell their produce to him for little, …

136
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,119
… then turn around and sell it on the open market,

137
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,439
… pocketing the difference at an unthinkably high equivalent tax rate.

138
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,559
So taxes in democracies are low in comparison to dictatorships.

139
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,239
But why do representatives lower their take?

140
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,799
Well, cutting taxes is a crowd pleaser.

141
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,959
Dictators have no need to please the crowds and thus can take a large percentage from their poor citizens to pay key supporters.

142
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,439
But representatives in a democracy can take a smaller percentage …

143
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,959
from each to pay their key supporters, …

144
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,839
… because their educated, freer citizens are more productive than peasants.

145
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,879
For rulers in a democracy, the more productivity the better.

146
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,719
Which is why they build universities and hospitals and roads and grant freedoms, …

147
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,119
…not just out of the goodness of their hearts but because it increases citizen productiveness,…

148
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,119
… which increases treasure for the ruler and their key supporters, even when a lower percentage is taken.

149
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,359
Democracies are better places to live than dictatorships,…

150
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,239
… not because representatives are better people,…

151
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,959
… but because their needs *happen* to be aligned with a large portion of the population.

152
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,799
The things that make citizens more productive also make their lives better.

153
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,159
Representatives want everyone productive, so everyone gets highways.

154
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,079
The worst dictators are those whose incentives are aligned with the fewest citizens, …

155
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,039
… those who have the fewest keys to power.

156
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,159
This explains why the worst dictatorships have something in common.

157
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,919
Gold or oil or diamonds or similar.

158
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,479
If the wealth of a nation is mostly dug out of the ground: it’s a terrible place to live…

159
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,159
… because a gold mine can run with dying slaves, and still produce great treasure.

160
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,239
Oil is harder, but luckily foreign companies can extract and refine it without any citizen involvement.

161
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:18,719
With citizens outside this cycle, they can be ignored while the ruler is rewarded and the keys to power kept loyal.

162
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,119
Thus we live in a world where the best, smartest democracies are stable, …

163
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,319
…the worst, richest dictatorships are stable, and in between is a valley of revolution.

164
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,399
The resource-rich dictators build roads only from their ports to their resources and from their palace to the airport, …

165
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,479
… and the people stay quiet not because this is fine or even because they’re scared, …

166
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,839
… but because the cold truth is: starving, disconnected, illiterates don't make good revolutionaries.

167
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:57,279
Now a middling dictator without resources must, as mentioned before, take a large amount of wealth directly from his poor farmers and factory workers.

168
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,159
Thus two roads won't do, and so he must maintain some minimums of life for the citizens.

169
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,319
But keeping the work-force somewhat connected and somewhat educated and somewhat healthy …

170
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,279
… makes them more able to revolt.

171
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,559
Now understand: the romantic image of the people storming the gates and overthrowing their dictator is mostly a fantasy.

172
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,839
If you run a middling dictatorship, the people only storm the palace when the army *lets them* to remove you, …

173
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,719
… because you lost control over your keys and are being replaced.

174
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:39,839
This is why after 'popular revolts’ in middling dictatorships, the new ruler is often the same as the old, if not worse.

175
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:47,999
The people didn't replace the king, the court replaced the king, using the peoples' protest they let happen to do it.

176
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,399
The very things a benevolent dictator wants to build to cross this valley …

177
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,719
… take treasure away from the keys to power and make the citizens more able to revolt, …

178
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,639
… often ending in a stronger ruler less likely to build bridges and more loyal to his keys.

179
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,839
On the other side, the best democracies are stable not just because the large number of keys…

180
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,239
… and their competing desires makes dictatorial revolt near-impossible to organize, …

181
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,199
… but also because the revolt would destroy the very wealth it intended to capture.

182
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,079
The high productivity of the citizens.

183
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:30,199
Plus: those helping the would-be dictator in a democracy know he plans to cull key supporters once in power.

184
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,319
That’s what’s a coup is.

185
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,119
So potential key supporters must weigh the probability of surviving the cull and getting the rewards, …

186
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,319
… versus the risk of being on the outside of a dictatorship they helped create.

187
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,599
In a stable democracy, that’s a terrible gamble:

188
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,719
maybe you'll be incredibly wealthy, …

189
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,919
… but probably you'll be dead and have made the lives of everyone you know worse.  The math says no.

190
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:01,919
Being on the right side of a coup in a dictatorship means having the resources to get you and your family what the peasants lack.

191
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,199
Health care, education, quality of life — this is what make the competition for power so fierce.

192
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,319
But in a democracy most already have these things, so why risk it?

193
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,679
So the more the wealth of a nation comes from the productive citizens of the nation, …

194
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,679
… the more the power gets spread out and the more the ruler must maintain the quality of life for those citizens.

195
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,319
The less, the less.

196
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,239
Now if a stable democracy becomes very poor, …

197
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,839
… or if a resource that dwarfs the productivity of the citizens is found, …

198
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,719
… the odds of this gamble change, and make it more possible for a small group to seize power.

199
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:48,919
Because if the current quality of life is terrible or the wealth not dependent on the citizens, coups are worth the risk.

200
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,079
When democracies fall, these are usually the reasons.

201
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,039
*somber music*

202
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,839
These rules for rulers explain not only why some men are monsters and others are merciful, …

203
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:07,358
… but everything about politics: from war to foreign aid, to political dynasties, to corruption.

204
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,239
All of which, we can talk about at another time.

205
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,118
But for now, you aspiring ruler, may be disgusted by the world of politics, …

206
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,439
… and have decided to avoid it entirely, but you cannot, for rulers come in many forms.

207
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:26,519
Yes, Kings, Presidents and Prime Ministers but also Deans, Dons, Mayors, Chairs, Chiefs.

208
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,999
These rules apply to all and explain their actions: from the CEO of the largest global corporate conglomerate …

209
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,479
… who must keep his board happy, to the chair of the smallest home owner’s association, …

210
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,279
… managing votes and spending membership fees.

211
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,079
You cannot escape structures of power.

212
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,479
You can only turn a blind eye to understanding them, and …

213
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,959
… if you ever want the change you dream about, there is a zeroth rule you cannot ignore.

214
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,119
Without power you can affect nothing.

215
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,679
You may not like these rules, but surely, better you on the throne than someone else.

216
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,679
And who knows, maybe you’ll be different.

217
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,279
*somber piano music, slowly fading*

218
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,759
This video and its follow-ups are based largely on The Dictator’s Handbook by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alistair Smith, …

219
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,279
… which is simply the best book on politics written.

220
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,079
There is far more detail and far more examples in it than I could ever hope to cover any series of videos.

221
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,719
Every citizen should read this book, and...
