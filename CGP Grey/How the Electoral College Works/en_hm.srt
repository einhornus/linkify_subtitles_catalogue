1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,789
Ah, Election Day, when Americans everywhere
cast their ballot for the next President of

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,969
the United States.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,119
Except, not really – Americans don't directly
vote for president.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,899
So, what's happening on election day then?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,619
It's a bit complicated because of something
called the Electoral College.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,499
To keep things simple for now, think of the
Electoral College as a collection of the 538

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,299
votes that determine who the President of
the United States will be.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,719
Why 538?

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,659
Because that's the number of Senators 100
plus the number of Representatives, 438 in

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,659
Congress.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,349
Why are there 438 Representatives in Congress?

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,989
Stop asking so many question right now we're
trying to keep this simple:

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,069
These 538 votes in the Electoral College aren't
given to the citizens directly, but are instead

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,779
divided among the states.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,909
So how does the Electoral College give out
the votes?

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,479
Each state, no matter how populous or not,
gets three votes to start.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,869
The remaining votes are given out roughly
in proportion to the population of the state.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,069
The more people the state has, the more votes
it gets.

19
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,398
Here is a map of the United States showing
the voting power each states has by making

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,909
one hexagon equal to one electoral college
vote for president.

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,459
Because electoral votes mostly – though
not completely – scale with population it's

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,789
also a map of where people live with a bonus
given to the smaller states to make them a

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,228
bit bigger than they would otherwise be.

24
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:08,509
In early November, when citizens go to the
polls they aren't voting for president directly

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,309
but they're really telling their state how
they want *it* to use its electoral votes.

26
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,109
48 of the 50 states give all their electoral
college votes to the candidate who wins a

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,958
majority in their state.

28
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,319
Take Florida, for example, which has 29 electoral
college votes.

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,199
If a candidate wins a majority, no matter
how small that majority, he gets all the votes.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,108
So the path to the Whitehouse is clear: win
enough majorities in enough states to get

31
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:32,978
more than half of the Electoral college votes
and you get to sit at the big desk.

32
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,428
That wasn't so complicated, you say.

33
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,818
Well, there were a few details left out:

34
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:40,148
The Electoral College loves states, but what
about the 11 million Americans who don't live

35
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:41,148
in a state?

36
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,758
What happens to their vote, and where are
these people hiding?

37
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,078
There are about 600,000 in the District of
Columbia an area set aside specifically *not*

38
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,208
to be a state so that the capital of the country
would be free of local politics.

39
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,559
For most of the United States' history people
living in the district didn't get to vote

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,678
for president.

41
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:58,489
Then in 1964 the constitution was amended
to give D.C. the same number of votes as the

42
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,178
least populous state, Wyoming.

43
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:01,849
So the electoral college likes DC.

44
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,248
But you know who it doesn't like?

45
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:04,388
The Territories.

46
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:08,097
The often forgotten Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S.
Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands,

47
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,458
get no votes from the electoral college because
they aren't states and they don't have a special

48
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,789
constitutional amendment to recognize them.

49
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,438
Which is a bit odd considering they're part
of the United States and everyone who lives

50
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,789
there is a citizen so -- for most practical
purposes -- they're just like D.C.

51
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,628
And 4.4 Million people live in the territories
-- that might not sound like a lot, but it's

52
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,488
than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska & Delaware.

53
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:28,488
Combined.

54
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,339
But still, no votes from the Electoral College
do they get.

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,268
The whole situation with territories is extra
strange when you consider the final group

56
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,348
of Americans who don't live in States, the
6.3 million Americans who live abroad.

57
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,238
If you're a United States citizen who moves
to a foreign country, you can usually send

58
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,359
a postal vote to the last state that you resided
in.

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,649
But, if you move *within the United States*
to one of its territories, you lose your right

60
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,718
to vote for president for as long as you live
there – making these the only spots on the

61
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,458
whole earth where Americans are not allowed
to vote for president.

62
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,078
Actually, they're the only spots in the whole
Universe because American astronauts are allowed

63
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,908
to vote for space.

64
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:01,179
The last bit of electoral college complication
is the weirdest and has to do with the votes

65
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,179
themselves.

66
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,609
The state of Florida -- and all the others
-- doesn't really give votes to a candidate,

67
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,309
that's just a simplified way to think about
it, because the reality of the situation is...

68
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,309
odd.

69
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,669
What citizens are voting for on election day
is a group of electors appointed by the political

70
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,738
parties who chose the president on the citizens'
behalf.

71
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,718
The number of votes that a state gets from
the Electoral College is actually the number

72
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,209
electors the state is allowed to send to a
collegiate meeting to vote on who the president

73
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,389
will be.

74
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,429
What makes it odd is that while these electors
promise they will vote for president as their

75
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,348
state's citizens want them to, *they aren't
required to do so*.

76
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:35,869
Electors are free to vote the way they want
. While this has never swung an election,

77
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,919
87 times in the past electors have voted against
the wishes of the very people who elected

78
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,919
them.

79
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,688
Why set up this crazy system where a small
group of people essentially unknown to the

80
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,669
general public are the ones who really decide
on the president?

81
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,689
Because in the 1700s -- when the electoral
collage was designed -- the quickest way to

82
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,039
send a piece of information was to write it
on a piece of paper, hand it to a guy on a

83
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,779
horse, wish him 'godspeed, good sir' and hope
he didn't get killed by indians or die of

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,158
dysentery along the way.

85
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,589
Because information moved so slowly and because
the young country was so big, the idea was

86
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,089
to send all the electors to Washington where
they could have the most up-to-date information

87
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,268
to make decisions for the people back home
who wouldn't know the latest news.

88
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,559
Though now, when we carry information on beams
of light in fiber optic cables rather than

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,439
on the backs of herd animals this particular
aspect of the electoral college might seem

90
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,659
a little out of date.

91
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,499
None the less, while most people think that
the election for president takes place in

92
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,429
early november it doesn't -- that's the election
that determines who the electors will be.

93
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,619
The 538 electors who are chosen then meet
in early december and they cast the real votes

94
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,100
that determine who is the next president of
the United States.
