1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,289
1066!

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,718
The start of the royal family on these fair
isles.

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,249
Well, there were kings and mini countries
before that and druids before that, and Pangaea

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,979
before that, but we have to start somewhere
and a millennia ago is plenty far -- if that

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,659
leaves out Æthelred the Unready, so it goes.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,539
William the Conqueror, conquered in the 'Norman
Conquest' -- Norman here being code for *French*.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,159
Because it's the olden days, people had lots
of kids, but to keep things simple this family

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,389
tree is going to leave out many of them on
each branch because not every child matters.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,129
So William had three kids we care about: William
II, Henry I and Adela.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,389
If you've seen the video about royal succession
-- click here if you haven't -- you'll know

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,209
that formal rules for passing on the crown
will get established, but for now, it's a

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,308
free-for-all, home team advantage to the eldest
son, but never forget bigger-army diplomacy.

13
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,869
Upon William the Conquerors death, William
II became king.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,819
William II didn't marry, and on a bros day
out with Henry died in a 'Hunting Accident'

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,349
that gave Henry I the crown.

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,128
Henry I had at least 26 children of which
only two were 100% legit.

17
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,608
He declared his daughter would rule next (after
his son died in a ship wreck) and swore his

18
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,889
knights to honor Empress Matilda by crossing
their hearts, hoping to die, sticking a needle

19
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,319
in their eye -- *but* when Henry I died while
Matilda was in France, many ignored this while

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,219
her cousin Stephen raced to Westminster using
faster army diplomacy to get coronated first.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,609
Empress Matilda did eventually return and
start a decades-long civil war -- that was

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,689
pretty much a stalemate because turtling in
the 1100s was an effective RTS tactic.

23
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,059
While she did rule part of the island, as
Matilda never had an official coronation,

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,599
her monarchical status is disputed.

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,589
Now, as Stephen's children were either dead,
disinterested, or a nun -- his crown went

26
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,249
to his nephew, Henry II who had four sons:
Henry the Young, Richard the Lionheart, King

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,359
John… and Geoff.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,169
(Guess who died before his turn?)

29
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,399
Henry II saw the history thus far of conquering,
assassination, (maybe) usurpation, attritional

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,689
war -- and decided waiting until after the
death of the current king before sorting out

31
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,489
the *next* king didn't work.

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,299
So Henry II changed the system and crowned
Henry the Young co-king with him, invoking

33
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,699
the rule of two: one is none.

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,699
Two is one.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,289
If it's important, you need a backup.

36
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,589
It was a good plan for stability, helped by
the young King's popularity, but unfortunately

37
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,959
-- the apprentice rebelled against the master,
rallying his brothers -- which resulted in

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,890
another civil war of disputed monarchs during
which Henry the Young died of dysentery, Henry

39
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:09,728
the Elder died of fever, and Richard I took
the crown.

40
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,079
After Richard came John and four eldest son
successions in a row: John to Henry III (insert

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,729
Magna Carta here) to Edward I (Longshanks)
to Edward II -- to Edward III.

42
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,818
Actually Ed II was overthrown by Isabelle
of France A.K.A the She-Wolf of France A.K.A.

43
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:23,818
his wife.

44
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,719
After deposing her husband, she acted as regent
for their son.

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,169
Every one of these arrows glosses over a bit
of complexity.

46
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,688
Edward III had five sons: Edward the Black
Prince, Lionel, John, Edmund, and Thomas,

47
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,139
none of which would wear the crown.

48
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,968
When Edward III died, his throne would have
gone to The Black Prince, but he was dead

49
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:43,718
at the time so the crown went to his boringly
named son Richard, now the second.

50
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,629
There's a bunch of drama lamma stuff around
Richard the second which your English teacher

51
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,669
might force you to read about -- but spoiler
alert, history's ending is always the same:

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,669
bigger-army diplomacy, this time from Henry
IV who gets the crown and Richard II gets

53
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,179
starvation in captivity.

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,479
Another Henry before we get to the War of
the Roses:

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,199
A war that strikes terror (and boredom) in
the minds of students of history the nation

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,068
over who have to deal with *this* family tree
'simplified' to explain why everyone was angry,

57
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,268
but the shortest version ever is Edward III's
great, great, grandsons duked it out, even

58
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,309
though one of them was dead for part of the
fight -- but we can't get into that now so

59
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,869
Henry VI to Edward IV to Henry VI to Edward
IV.

60
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,869
The end.

61
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,908
Edward IV, on his deathbed left his crown
to his son.

62
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:26,018
But being twelve he needed protection, so
Richard, his best-ist uncle in the world,

63
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:27,688
promised to take super-good care of him.

64
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,998
Edward V then promptly disappeared under suspicious
circumstances that left Richard to become

65
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:32,998
Richard the third.

66
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:37,298
But he didn't stay king for long because Edward
III's great, great, great, great grandson

67
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,498
Henry VII -- took the crown, put a ring on
Elizabeth of York to lock down that royal

68
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:45,679
legitimacy and then sired Henry VIII -- splitter
of churches, and ladies.

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,028
Henry VIII thought it was high time to formalize
the rules of inheritance, so he wrote them

70
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:54,688
out in his will -- basically saying oldest
boys first, girls only if there aren't any

71
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:56,718
boys -- and Parliament approved the rules.

72
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,858
Which should have made everything neat and
tidy, but we're about to enter the really

73
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:01,968
messy time...

74
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:06,809
… Because Henry's son lived just long enough
to screw it up -- inheriting the throne at

75
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,979
9 there was, of course, a scheming protectorate
running things, yet he still declared at 15

76
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,259
that his father's rules were dumb and his
sisters were dumb and that his first cousin

77
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,479
once removed, Lady Jane Grey, should be the
next monarch instead.

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,679
Then he died and Lady Jane Grey became queen
at sweet sixteen, sort of -- in a disputed

79
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,169
status way for nine days, until beheaded by
Mary, the first really, truly officially nobody

80
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,388
doubts it Queen.

81
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,689
Mary didn't have any kids, and passed the
crown to Elizabeth I who became the second

82
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,279
queen in a row… to also not have children.

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,709
But, no problem because Lady Jane Grey was
next in … oh.

84
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,709
Right.

85
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,939
Now, this is the point at which we acknowledge,
Scotland Exists.

86
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,448
They'd been doing their own royal thing which
for our purposes joins the English branch

87
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:53,459
where Edward III's great granddaughter married
into it in the 1400s and then goes: James,

88
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,689
James, James, James, James, Mary Queen of
Scotts, James.

89
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,649
Bringing us back to the 1600s.

90
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,089
Henry the VIII's sister importantly also married
into this line of the family giving it English

91
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,779
legitimacy points in the eyes of the English
Parliament, which asked to borrow Scotland's

92
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,418
James, making him king of two countries with
two numbers in his name depending on where

93
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,579
you're counting from.

94
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,878
James had a son, Charles I, and you might
think this unification of the monarchs means

95
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,878
the very messy time is over.

96
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,918
But no.

97
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,168
Because Cromwell.

98
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,579
Cromwell didn't like kings and beheaded Charles
I: declaring no royals no longer, making himself

99
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,668
The Lord Protector which was in no way like
a king -- even though he was in charge and

100
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,038
it was a hereditary office passed to his son.

101
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,959
But the Cromwells didn't last -- mainly because
his son was a fancy country squire who didn't

102
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,559
follow rule 0: keep the army happy -- giving
Charles's son, Charles II, the ability to

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,448
reestablish the monarchy.

104
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:51,209
Charles II had lots of children, all of which
were illegitimate, leaving his brother, James

105
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,508
II next in line.

106
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,769
But James II was *Catholic* and ever since
Henry split the church, Catholics had terrible

107
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,948
approval ratings.

108
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:04,818
But conveniently, he had nice Protestant daughters,
one married to a Dutch Prince who by the nature

109
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:09,749
of these things was the grandson of Charles
I. Bonus English legitimacy points, plus,

110
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,168
who doesn't like the Dutch?

111
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:16,219
With James so unpopular and William and Mary
so popular, the army and nobles pretty much

112
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,478
invited the royal couple to 'invade' and James
II fled.

113
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,878
William and Mary ruled as co-monarchs, but
without children the crown went to Queen Anne,

114
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,668
who also didn't produce any heirs, though
not from lack of effort -- she was pregnant

115
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,089
*seventeen* times.

116
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,609
Again, finding themselves with a no-royals-no-longer
situation, Parliament decided it was really,

117
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,598
truly seriously the time to sort out the rules
of inheritance to avoid pretenders from every

118
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,688
branch of this messy tree fighting over the
crown.

119
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,109
Parliament did a royal reboot to clear the
cruft, defining Sophia of Hanover -- the granddaughter

120
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,638
of James dual numbers to be the new starting
point for all claims to the crown.

121
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,388
These rules finally stuck, thus ending the
very messy time.

122
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,408
George I, son of Sophia, was the first king
under the new rules, then his son George II,

123
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:05,938
to George III, and even though he lost America
and his mind, never fear, the rules are here,

124
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,029
so the crown continued to calmly descend the
family tree, going to George IV, who didn't

125
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,629
have any surviving children, to William IV
who had ten children -- all illegitimate,

126
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,909
then passing through his dead younger brother
to Queen Victoria who started her reign in

127
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,918
1837 and made it to just over the finishing
line of the 20th century.

128
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,918
Which is a doubly impressively long time given
the state of medical technology then.

129
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,418
After the end of her age, the crown went to
her son Edward VII to George V…

130
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,568
to Edward VIII who *finally* breaks up this
neat and tidy (and somewhat boring) line of

131
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,699
succession by committing a scandal: marrying
a commoner.

132
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,309
An American Commoner!

133
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,059
An American Commoner *divorcee*! *twice over*

134
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,059
::Gasp::

135
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,228
Actually, the divorces were a real problem
and weren't compatible with the Monarch's

136
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,379
role as Head of State *and also* the Church
of England in the 1930s.

137
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,388
Edward abdicated to his brother George VI
-- who was reluctant to take the crown, and

138
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:03,228
then had to oversee World War II and the subsequent
breakup of the British Empire -- which drained

139
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,859
the reluctant King's health, who died at 56
leaving the crown to Elizabeth the Second,

140
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,009
in 1952 at the age of 25.

141
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,899
Seven years older than Victoria, her great
great grandmother was on her coronation day,

142
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,329
but in early September, 2015, Elizabeth became
the longest-reigning Queen in not just British

143
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,929
history, but world history.

144
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,788
From Elizabeth II the crown continues on to
Charles, the longest heir apparent in British

145
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,598
history, to his son William, to his son George.

146
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:59,220
And that, is a brief history of the royal
family.
