1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,569
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is giving
more democracy to her citizens by adding a

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,798
legislative branch to the government.

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,729
The citizens each get one vote and are divided
into ranges. Each range will elect one representative

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,369
to send to the newly created Jungle Council.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,570
To best understand how this system works,
lets look at a small colony where there are

6
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:20,859
just two political parties: Buffalo & Jackalope.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,909
This colony is divided into four ranges. In
the first election Jackalope candidates win

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,788
two of them and buffalo candidates win the
rest.

9
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,769
All is well for several election cycles until
the Animal Kingdom Census taker comes round

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,648
and shows that the population has both moved
and grown.

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,259
To better represent the larger population
a new seat is added to the Jungle council

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,488
so the ranges' boundaries must be re-drawn.

13
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:45,828
This is where the trouble begins. Re-drawing
electoral boundaries is a huge political problem.

14
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:49,768
To help them, the representatives of the Jungle
Council hire a weaselly consultant to figure

15
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,009
out where the new boundaries should go.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,349
If Weasel draws rectangular boundaries everything
is OK because the jungle council will, as

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,568
close as possible, reflect how the citizens
vote.

18
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:04,329
However, Weasel doesn't do this. Instead he
tells the Buffalo Party that, for a price,

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,470
he can turn their slim majority into a landslide
victory in the election.

20
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:11,669
With a super-majority on the Jungle Council
the Buffalo wouldn't have to listen to those

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,228
pesky Jackalope filibusters anymore, so the
Buffalo gladly pay up.

22
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,169
How can Weasel deliver on his promise? It's
depressingly simple: by packing together as

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,288
many jackalope voters into one range as possible
and spreading the rest of them out, The Buffalo

24
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:28,029
Party can win an additional seat without any
voters switching allegiance.

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,508
What Weasel and the Buffalo have done is called
'gerrymandering'. The intensional changing

26
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,368
of electoral boundaries for their benefit.

27
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,209
Several election cycles later the under-represented
and disgruntled Jackalope party approaches

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,099
Weasel and asks if he can manipulate the ranges
to be in their favor instead of the Buffalos'.

29
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,989
Indeed he can. Using the same trick, Weasel
packs Buffalo voters into a few ranges and

30
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,739
spreads the rest among the Jackalope supporters.

31
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,169
After the election the Jackalopes, who represent
a minority of the voters are now, nonetheless,

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,449
the majority party on the Jungle Council.

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,828
This is the terrible power of Gerrymandering:
Weasel can take the exact same voters and

34
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,199
get either party to win the election.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,189
Unsurprisingly, Weasel's business grows and
eventually every colony in the Animal Kingdom

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,569
pays him to gerrymander their ranges.

37
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,279
With so many clients, Weasel now uses his
computer test hundreds of thousands of range

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,259
combinations with elaborate statistical models
of voter behavior to get the results he needs.

39
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,849
Queen Lion has seen what Weasel is up to and
banishes him from her kingdom. But, the census

40
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,799
taker reminds her that ranges still need to
be re-drawn as the population changes. So

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,879
how is it going to be decided?

42
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,459
Queen Lion suggests the obvious solution:
a bi-partisan committee must agree on all

43
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,179
new range boundaries.

44
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,769
This seems like a good idea. After all, if
both parties have to agree on the ranges,

45
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,819
then they must end up being fair to everyone.

46
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,279
But, after a few election cycles using this
solution, Queen Lion notices that she always

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,449
sees the same faces on the Jungle Council.
Representatives almost never get defeated

48
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,049
in their elections.

49
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,489
It turns out that the interests of the representatives
and the interests of the citizens are not

50
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,449
the same. Citizens want elections where the
candidates have to earn their vote. These

51
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,119
are close elections where either candidate
has a chance of winning.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
But, representatives don't want close elections,
they want safe elections. Elections where

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,679
they run in a range that is filled with supporters.

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,809
Because the representatives are in change
of the boundaries they make the safest ranges

55
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,809
possible.

56
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,379
So, bi-partisan committees are not enough.
To truly fix gerrymandering there are three

57
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,379
options:

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,119
The first is to set up a politically independent
commission of appointed experts or judges

59
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,619
to draw the boundaries.

60
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,059
Independent commissions are much better than
bi-partisan committees, but still not ideal

61
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,489
because they usually group similar areas together
so the elections are uncompetitive.

62
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,970
And there is always the possibility that the
independent commission is not as independent

63
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:37,149
as it appears.

64
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,659
The second option is to let math decide the
boundaries. There are a number of ways to

65
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,799
mathematically divide an area into equally
populous ranges.

66
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,499
The simplest example of this is called the
'shortest split-line method'. Find the shortest

67
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,319
line that splits the voters in twain and repeat
as necessary until all the ranges are made.

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,099
This is much better than an 'independent'
commission, but it does have the problem of

69
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,799
occasionally producing skewed election results
just through pure bad luck of where the boundaries

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,259
are drawn.

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,399
But by publishing the algorithm used, all
citizens can check the results and be confident

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,179
that there is no intensional bias in the system.

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,189
The last solution is an unexpected one: hire
back the weasel and embrace gerrymandering.

74
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,028
But this time, pay him make the winners most
closely match the voters as a whole.

75
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:20,208
While it seems unsavory, this is actually
the best way to avoid disproportionate representation

76
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,799
which is, by far, the the worst problem of
gerrymandering.

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,979
But, considering these three solutions leaves
Queen Lion grumpy.

78
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,879
The first two are improvements, but still
may result in uncompetitive elections or disproportionate

79
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,279
results while the third just feels wrong.
Gerrymandering to avoid the problems of gerrymandering

80
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,659
is... odd.

81
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,319
Remembering what she learned about voting
before, she realizes all this gerrymandering

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,299
is really just a symptom of a more fundamental
problem: the method by which each citizen

83
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,459
gets only one vote and elects only one representative.

84
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,109
There are ways to eliminate gerrymandering
and restore competitive elections to make

85
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,359
her citizens happy, but to do that Queen Lion
is going to have to make some big, fundamental

86
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,190
changes to her democracy.
