00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,439
they don't have to be so while you've spent perhaps a decade to become a bishop to then become a cardinal, the Pope can *poof*

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,569
make any priest a cardinal at any time.

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,529
It's rare like *your former job was the director of the Sistine Chapel choir* rare

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,369
but not unheard of. In fact, every stage in this whole process is subject to the sitting Pope's whim so rules without exceptions are themselves exceptions.
