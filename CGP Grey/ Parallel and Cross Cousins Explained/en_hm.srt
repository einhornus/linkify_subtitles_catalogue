Some families divide first cousins into two groups : Parallel and Cross.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,999
Let's focus on you for a second to make this easier to think about.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,799
Now, your father's brother's children and your mother's sister's children are your parallel cousins.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,699
That's when the sex of your parent matches the sex of their sibling.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,299
The sex of the cousins in question is totally irrelevant.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:31,100
And cross cousins are just the reverse. Your father's sister's children and your mother's brother's children are your cross cousins.
