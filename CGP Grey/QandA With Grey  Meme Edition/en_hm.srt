00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,939
Hello Internet. It's Q&A time.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,039
First question: "Are memes the future of society?"

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,919
I think you meant this as a joke, but the answer is yes.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,359
The internet, for memes, is the perfect petri dish, gladiatorial theater, and mutation chamber...

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,079
growing, selecting, and randomizing the memest memes to meme in our minds.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,359
Society has always been a war of memes, but before it was fought with sticks and stones.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,699
The internet, however, has arms-raced that fight to trench warfare of meme-driven brains in many areas.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,559
They've not yet captured all fields of thought, but I fear the meme trenches will only expand.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,739
In a previous Q&A, I was asked what topic I've changed my mind on...

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,919
...and the unmitigated benefits of the Internet sure is one of those things.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,659
"Rate from top to bottom: pancakes, waffles, french toast."

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,159
If you know you're at a great restaurant, then the ordering hierarchy is:...

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,639
...french toast before waffles before pancakes.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,119
If you're at a restaurant of unknown quality, the hierarchy reverses.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,099
Pancakes are more reliably consistent and thus can't reach the repulsive troughs or sublime peaks of French Toast.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,579
“What makes you unique compared to the 7 billion people on Earth?”

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,839
In a world of billions, no one is unique.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,819
“If you could have a companion animal like "The Golden Compass" what would you have?”

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,939
A chimpanzee daemon: maximize utility while minimizing inconvenience.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,719
“What common life advice do you disagree with?”

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,999
"Do what you love" and her sister meme: "Follow your passion".

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,579
The word 'passion' here is a disgusting perversion of language if, you know, words mean things.

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,639
And yes, there are people who are 'passionate' (gross) about their work, but guess what?

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,879
Those kinds of people don't need advice.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,819
They're going to do whatever they're uh 'passionate' about anyway.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,359
So this advice is useless to who are its exemplars,…

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,259
…while being anti-useful to everyone else,...

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:39,039
...making most people feel bad about their lives and their work by setting an impossibly high bar.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,519
In life, rather than expecting to find a burning passion inside yourself that you somehow don't know about already (because it doesn't exist)...

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,579
...it's better and more useful to think of life like fishing -- some spots are beautiful (to you) ...

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,099
...and in some spots your skills will catch fish, others not.

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,239
But you can't know where you'd like to spend time until you go there ...

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,619
and you can't know how many fish you can catch there until you try.

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,919
The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots…

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,899
and then the older you are the more time you get to spend in places you know you like,...

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,299
…refining your abilities to catch fish there.

37
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,339
"Did you have a point in life that turned you around productivity wise?

38
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,699
If so what changed, and what contributed to that change?"

39
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,439
Yes, there was a time and an event.

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,139
I drifted through school without learning how to be organized because, …

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,839
…despite what schools tell you about preparing you for the real world, …

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,259
…they're mostly a babysitting service obsessed with an endless game of Trivial Pursuit.

43
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,219
When school dumped me into the real world I had no idea how to adult, …

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,879
…and needed to figure it out fast.

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,339
The single thing that changed me the most was keeping a paper notebook in my pocket…

46
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,799
… and writing down my thoughts and simply looking back at that notebook on a regular basis.

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,059
That loop booted me into a real human.

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,659
It's so simple, but it comes down to increasing communication between …

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,979
…the past, present, and future you.

50
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,979
That's how you direct change in yourself over time.

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,039
"What motivates you to do anything productive when everything is meaningless anyway?"

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,179
This 'if we all die what's the point' meme is a bad one for brains.

53
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,079
Like, it's true that in the long run we are all naught but dust, forgotten. Forever.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,179
But your present experiences are real and they're all you'll ever have.

55
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,559
A sunset doesn't need meaning to be enjoyed, the enjoyment is the meaning.

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,999
Using productivity to build a life you want to live is intrinsically meaningful, …

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,219
…despite Abyss swallowing us all in the end.

58
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,199
If you're not in a good place, there's lots of small stuff you can do to start turning that around…

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,119
Watch this, do the opposite.

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,599
“What would you do if you became immortal?”

61
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,839
I'd live a really long time.

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,679
“On a D&D alignment chart, where would you place yourself?”

63
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,079
Oh, D&D alignment charts, so fun because of the endless disagreements over…

64
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,519
… what the words ‘lawful, chaotic, good, evil, and neutral’ mean.

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,659
You think it's obvious, but so does the guy you're arguing with.

66
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,339
People might think I’m over here, but I might view myself as over here,…

67
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,119
or depending on how much you want to want to D&D rules lawyer the word 'chaos', …

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,479
…maybe even over here.

69
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,039
But the question ultimately presupposes the lie that people are consistent selves.

70
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,019
And in reality our selves are situational and everyone is everything for a time or under the right circumstances.

71
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,179
But that's no fun: it's easier and memesier to put people on a 2D grid!

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,159
And I've yet to see a D&D alignment chart for YouTube.

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,639
Who among Tubers is our lawful good, and who is our chaotic evil?

74
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,039
On the reddit, I look forward to seeing your 2D D&D interpretations of the multi-faceted people on this site.

75
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,619
“You are allowed to change the name of the 7th planet on our solar system what would you call it?”

76
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,859
King George, of course! I’m still serious about this meme. #7thPlanetKingGeorge

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,159
“If you could remove a single trait/characteristic from human beings as a species what would it be and why?”

78
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,839
Human tribalism... is a double-edged sword.

79
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,119
There were 14,000 questions submitted to this Q&A on my the reddit, …

80
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,759
…and it's astounding to see how many are really asking: "Are you part of my tribe or not?".

81
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,619
And it's disappointing to see how badly people react when the answer is 'no' --

82
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,759
even on the most trivial of things.

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,019
However tribalism is how we develop teamwork and teamwork is how we build civilizations.

84
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,719
But tribes are so often motivated by the totem they construct of the other tribe to yell at.

85
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,179
So if tribalism and the teamwork it creates could still exist …

86
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,019
…when removing the tendency to build totems to burn in effigy, I'd do that.

87
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,739
“Can you wear a hat for the rest of the video?”

88
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,639
Uh-OK

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,699
"What's your opinion on whether Balrogs have wings?"

90
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,099
Ahh, the great Balrog debate of 2000 lives on.

91
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,559
There's a good reason my Balrog is drawn the way it is.

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,559
The line from Fellowship reads: 
[Gandalf's] enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about [The Balrog] reached out like two vast wings.

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,159
Unambiguous: a shadow that’s ‘like wings’ isn’t wings. They're metaphorical wings.

94
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,199
Yet not two paragraphs later Tolkien writes:

95
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,059
" [The Balrog] drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall. "

96
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,699
Unambiguous: wings.

97
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,239
Or maybe not?

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,059
Are these wings the metaphorical wings from but 12 sentences earlier?

99
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:02,039
Well now this has become an argument about how big the room is that these real or metaphorical wings much stretch across.

100
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,199
Asking "Did the Balrog have wings?" The books have the same answer as: "Hey, where did the Orcs come from?"

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,879
"dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy?"

102
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,679
yyyy-mm-dd

103
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,099
"What are your thoughts on your thoughts?"

104
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,199
Who knows where thoughts come from, they just appear.

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,059
"Is the glass half full or half empty?"

106
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,579
Why must judgment be passed? The glass is this full.

107
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,879
"How would you rule the world?"

108
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,419
With compassion. And an IRON FIST.

109
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,319
"AM I FIRST ?????? "

110
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,879
No: you were exactly 10,044th.

111
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,779
"What have you read recently? Any recommendations?"

112
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,419
I'm glad you asked, Never Not Act, for today's sponsor is Audible,...

113
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:39,059
…, who likes it when I recommend books and will give you a free audiobook with a 30-day trial at audible.com/grey

114
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,699
Related to that earlier question, I did recently read "Tribe" by Sebastian Junger...

115
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,819
…and it really changed my perception on the experiences soldiers have in war,…

116
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,999
… and how people act during disaster and just in general…

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,099
… how groups survive when there’s outside stresses acting on them.

118
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,879
It's a thoughtful book and it’s also nice and short, which is a big advantage.

119
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,479
So I liked Tribe.  I recommend it.  And if you want to give it a try, you can do so with Audible.

120
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,899
They have an unmatched library of audiobooks and original audio shows you can listen to.

121
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,959
Audiobooks have added a lot to my life and Audible is where I get my audiobooks from.

122
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,659
So you should give them a try and go get your free audiobook …

123
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,999
…maybe it’s Tribe, maybe it’s something else you want to listen to…

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,979
...with a 30-day trial at audible.com/grey

125
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,579
Thanks to Audible for sponsoring this episode and thank you to everyone who submitted questions.

126
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,900
I'll see you next time!
