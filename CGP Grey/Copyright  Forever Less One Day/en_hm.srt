1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:04,639
The origin of copyright law takes us back
to the 1710 and Queen Anne, the Monarch who

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,758
had just overseen the Unification of England
and Scotland into then, brand-new Great Britain.

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,779
Also on her busy schedule was the Statute
of Anne: the very first copyright law. It

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,098
gave authors control over who could make copies
of their books or build on their work a limited

5
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:19,529
time.
Later a group of rebellious colonists, thought

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,109
the Statue of Anne was a good idea, and so
copy/pasted it into their own constitution

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,039
giving congress the power:
“To promote the Progress of Science and

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,979
useful Arts, by securing for limited Times
to Authors… the exclusive right to their

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,158
respective Writings”.
Basically, copyright is a contract between

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,129
authors and society: if you promise to make
more stuff, we promise not to copy it or build

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,419
on it for 28 years.
Here’s an example from the modern day: let’s

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,939
say you’re trying to be a director and you’re
looking for a project to get started.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,819
Harry Potter is a story you’d love to remake.
But since J. K. Rowling published ‘The Sorcerer’s

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,578
Stone’ in the United States in 1998 it still
has copyright protection, so you can’t use

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,609
it.
Instead you need find something from a long

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,769
time ago, like, for example:
Star Wars: A New Hope!

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,769
George Lucas released Star Wars: A New Hope
in 1977! That’s more than 28 years ago,

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,669
So great! Get filming!
Alas, no.

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,868
While Star Wars should have lost copyright
protection in 2005 it’s actually copyrighted

20
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,548
until 2072!
That’s 95 years after publication, not 28!

21
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,248
So you can’t use it unless Lucas lets you.
Why does his copyright last for ages?

22
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:19,449
Well, as long as there has been copyright
there have been authors arguing that it’s

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,498
too short.
And perhaps, they’re right. How’s a poor

24
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:26,818
guy like George Lucas supposed turn a profit
in the mere 28 years between 1977 and 2005?

25
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,788
There was only the first theatrical release
of ‘A New Hope’,

26
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,228
And the theatrical re-released in 1978
and 1979

27
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,788
and 1981
and 1982

28
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:37,969
and then there was the 1982 VHS and Betamax
releases

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,839
the 1984 broadcast television release
the 1985 Laser disc release

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,008
the 1989 widescreen Laser disc release
the 1990 VHS re-release

31
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,918
the 1992 widescreen VHS release
the 1993 Laserdisc re-release

32
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:53,138
the 1995 VHS re-re-release
and the 1997 special edition theatrical release

33
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:56,428
Han shot first, you bastard.
and the 1997 VHS special edition release

34
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:00,888
and the 2004 DVD release
And now you, dear filmmaker, come along and

35
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:04,238
want make your own version of Star Wars:
a New Hope? For shame!

36
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,988
That like stealing food right out of George’s
Lucas’ mouth.

37
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,320
Four times Congress has agreed with authors
that the length of copyright is too short

38
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:15,229
to turn a profit and so extended it:
First in 1831 from 28 years to 42 years, then

39
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,848
again in 1909 to 56 years, in 1976 to the
lifetime of the author plus 50 years, and

40
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,208
in1998 to the lifetime of the author plus
70 years.

41
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,429
That’s a great deal for authors who have
already made stuff, but does it really help

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,848
society get more movies and books?
It’s hard to imagine, for example, that

43
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,369
Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing ‘A
Princess of Mars’ and ‘Tarzan’ in 1911

44
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,938
because the copyright laws had just been extended
and would not have done so otherwise.

45
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:40,539
Or that J. K. Rowling, while living on benefits
in Scotland, was busy doing the math and wouldn’t

46
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,129
have written Harry Potter if the copyright
protection was just for her whole life and

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,649
not an additional seven decades thereafter.
Because, exactly who needs incentives after

48
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,949
they’re dead? Dead is the point at which
literally no incentives in the whole universe

49
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,830
can motivate you to write one more screenplay.
Because you’re dead.

50
00:02:54,831 --> 00:03:00,239
If you’re the kind of person who is only
motivated by plans that unravel after your

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,309
demise, you’re either amazingly awesome
or deranged.

52
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,289
But so what? So what if every kindergartner’s
macaroni artwork is protected by copyright

53
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,919
for 175 years?
Why does it matter?

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,268
Because the main beneficiaries of copyright
after death are not the authors, or society

55
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,498
but companies. Companies like… Disney.
Remember all the good old Disney movies?

56
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:21,139
Yeah, all of them came from works no longer
under copyright protection at the time.

57
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,889
The whole of the Disney Empire and all the
childhood magic that it produces only exist

58
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,149
because there was copyright free work for
Walt Disney – you know the guy who actually

59
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,128
started the whole company – to rework and
update.

60
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:34,529
But the corporate, Waltless Disney was the
big pusher of the 1998 life +70 years copyright

61
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,989
extension. It made sure that no one could
make more popular versions of their movies

62
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,759
in the same way they made a more popular version
of Alice in Wonderland.

63
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,299
This near-infinite control subverts the whole
purpose of copyright which is to promote the

64
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,089
creation of more books and movies, not to
give companies the power to stop people making

65
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,658
new creative works based on the efforts on
their long-dead founders.

66
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,408
New directors and authors need the freedom
to take what came before to remake and remix

67
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,869
(romeo & juliet, emma). And they should be
able to use creative material from their own

68
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,059
lifetime to do so, not just be limited to
the work of previous generations.

69
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,938
At the turn of the century, George Lucas wrought
upon civilization a new word: anticipointment.

70
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,059
The tremendous let-down that was the lazy,
bland, and soulless new trilogy.

71
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,298
George Lucas’s was completely within his
rights to make those movies into the sterile,

72
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,309
toy-marketing vehicles they were. He owned
Darth Vader and could tell the origin story

73
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,469
as he wished – and that’s the only version
you’ll ever get to see.

74
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,439
But, imagine for a moment, if copyright still
worked as first intended.

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,379
In 2011 the whole of the original Star Wars
trilogy – all of its artwork, its characters,

76
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,369
its music – would have left copyright protection
and been available to aspiring directors and

77
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,969
writers to build upon and make their own versions
of.

78
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,949
There would be a treasure trove of new Star
Wars stories for fans to enjoy.

79
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,089
But as long as the current copyright laws
remain as they are, no living person will

80
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,779
ever get to tell a Darth Vader story, or a
Harry Potter Story, or a Hobbit Story or any

81
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,829
other story that matters to them, that the
author or, when after their death, their company,

82
00:04:48,830 --> 00:05:21,910
disagrees with.�
