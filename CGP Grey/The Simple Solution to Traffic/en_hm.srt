1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,279
Stuck at an intersection,

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,699
you always watch unfold 
the Fundamental Problem of Traffic.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,679
On green, the first car accelerates, and then the next,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,939
and then the next, and then the next, and then you,

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,459
only to catch the red.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,539
Had the cars accelerated simultaneously

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,378
you would have made it through.

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,319
Coordination - not cars - is the problem,

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,469
because we are
monkey drivers with slow reaction times

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,179
and short attention spans.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,359
Even if we tried getting everyone to
press the pedal on 3-2-1-now

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,679
would be challenging.

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,039
This dis-coordination limits
how many cars can get through an intersection

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,199
and when one backs up to the next,

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,699
that's when city-sized gridlock cascades
happen, taking forever to clear.

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,539
In general, more intersections equals more 
dis-coordination which equals more traffic.

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,579
This is the motive behind big highways:
no intersections.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,459
Splits and merges, yes. Intersections, no.

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,398
No stopping, no coordination problems, no traffic

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,639
Well that's the theory anyway.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,179
Intersections outside of a highway
 will back up onto it.

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,939
Again, because human reaction times
 limit how many cars can escape the off-ramp

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,268
when the light changes.

24
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:06,599
But, even without intersections,
there would still be traffic on the highway.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,239
Traffic can just appear.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,519
Take a one lane highway with happy cars flowing

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,439
until a chicken crosses the road.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,859
The driver who sees it brakes a little,

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,379
the driver behind him doesn't notice immediately
and brakes a little harder than necessary,

30
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,219
the driver behind him does the same 
until someone comes to a complete stop

31
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,359
and, oh look, cars approaching at highway
speeds must now stop as well.

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,059
Though the chicken is long gone,
it left a phantom intersection on the highway.

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,739
This is what's happened when
you're stuck in traffic for hours thinking,

34
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,119
"There must be a deadly pile up ahead"
and then suddenly, the traffic's over

35
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,059
with no wreckage in sight, 
to your relief if you're a good person

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,679
and mild annoyance if you aren't.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,859
You just pass through a
phantom intersection,

38
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,639
the cause of which is long gone.

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,139
And this phantom intersection moves.

40
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,079
It's really a traffic snake slithering down the road

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,519
eating oncoming cars at one end
and pooping them out the other.

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,739
On a ring road, a single car slowing down

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,559
will start an Ouroboros of traffic that will last forever,

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,339
even though there's no problem with the road.

45
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,879
If the drivers could coordinate to
accelerate and separate simultaneously,

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,859
easy driving would return.

47
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,159
But they can't, so traffic eternal.

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,039
On highways, traffic snakes grow
if cars are eaten faster than excreted,

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,359
and they shrink if excreted faster than eaten,

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,499
dying when the last car accelerates away
 before the next car must stop.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,819
Now, in multi-lane highways,
 there needs be no chicken to start gridlock.

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,759
A driver crossing lanes quickly
with cars too close behind is enough

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,719
to birth a traffic snake that lives for
hours and leagues.

54
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,919
It's this quick crossing that causes
drivers behind to over-brake and begin a chain reaction.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,619
But we *can* make traffic
snakes less likely by changing the way we drive.

56
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,819
Your goal as a driver is to
stay the same distance from the car ahead

57
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,419
as from the car behind at all times.

58
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,509
Tailgating is trouble. Not just because
it makes accidents more likely but

59
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,068
because you as the tailgater can start a
traffic snake if the driver ahead brakes.

60
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,988
Always in the middle!

61
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,208
This gives you the most time
to prevent over-braking

62
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,539
but also gives the driver
behind you the most time as well.

63
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,649
And when stuck in traffic,

64
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,298
this rule would get all cars to pull apart the snake faster.

65
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,439
That's the simple solution to traffic:
getting humans to change their behavior,

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,859
perhaps by sharing this video to show
how and why traffic happens,

67
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,999
why tailgaters are trouble, and how we can work together to make the roads better for all.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,479
The End.

69
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,568
Except, yeah...

70
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,799
wishing upon a star that people are
better than they are is a terrible solution.

71
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,579
Every time.

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,789
Instead, what works is a
structurally systematized solution

73
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,449
which is exactly what self-driving cars are.

74
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,069
Self-driving cars can just be programmed

75
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,519
to stay in the middle and accelerate simultaneously.

76
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,499
They'll just do it.

77
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,339
The more self-driving cars at an intersection,
the more efficient the intersection gets.

78
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,719
A solid lane of self-driving cars
vastly increases throughput.

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,729
Hmm, actually!

80
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,979
If you ban humans from the road
(which we should totally do anyway)

81
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,299
you can get rid of the intersection entirely.

82
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,418
After all, a traffic light is just a tool for drivers
on one road to communicate with drivers

83
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,579
on another, poorly and coarsely.

84
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,379
Red equals "Don't go now,
we are coming through the intersection."

85
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,639
Green equals "good to go."

86
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,399
But self-driving cars can talk
to each other at the speed of light.

87
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,229
with that kind of coordination, no traffic light necessary.

88
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,669
Just as with the highway, the best
intersection is no intersection.

89
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,989
Humans will never drive this precisely.

90
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,879
At the intersection, the fundamental problem with traffic

91
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,259
that you watch unfold, as well as everything, is people.

92
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,339
So the real simple solution to traffic:

93
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,259
is no more monkeys driving cars.
