1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,559
Many teachers have a poor work-life balance.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,619
I know, because I've had years of experience as a teacher in the classroom.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,499
I'm here to teach you how to handle your workload and restore that work-life balance.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,079
If you follow my time management methods, long days should be a thing of the past.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,199
You'll be able to go home on time, worry-free, knowing that you've done everything you need to do.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,799
Let's begin.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,819
One of the biggest challenges you face as a teacher is your uncooperative coworkers, your students.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,079
Sometimes they try and do as little work as is possible and it can be tempting to let them get away with it.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,879
After all, if some of them don't do their homework, that's less homework for you to mark.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,939
Small problems like this, such as letting an individual student get away

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,459
with not doing a homework or a project can quickly grow into big problems,

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,459
like the entire class not doing their homework.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,759
Ultimately, if the students aren't doing the work you're assigning them, they're going to do less well on the tests

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,119
and they're learning less.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,699
You'll also have to spend more and more time in your day dealing with classroom management issues

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,679
like trying to get them to do their work.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,559
The students don't learn just what you teach them directly. They're also learning about you as a person.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,919
If you are the kind of teacher who lets homework slide, they're going to be less and less likely to do work for you

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,379
and to respect you.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,879
You have to make sure that you're keeping track of everything that's going on in your classroom.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,979
But this is quite a challenge because often times, teachers have 500 or more students

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,739
that they need to be looking after.

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,959
How do you make sure that you're keeping track of what everybody owes you and what needs to be done?

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,759
The tool that I recommend that can change your life is just a small, sturdy clipboard.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,419
If you go out and you get one for yourself today, I guarantee you, it will change your life as a teacher.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,139
There are three kinds of things that you should keep on your clipboard:

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,499
Their tracking sheets, their daily must-do lists, and there's a general to-do list.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,059
I want to talk about the tracking sheet first.

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,159
The tracking sheet starts out its life as just a plain piece of blank paper.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,039
But as the days go by, if any student misses something for you, a homework or a project,

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,499
you put their name on this list, make a note of what the thing is they're missing,

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,039
and the date that this happened on.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,039
You should go through this list at least once a week and cross off anybody who's gotten work back to you.

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,579
Or send messages to those who haven't.

35
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,079
If a student continues not to give something to you, you need to look into your own school's sanctions policies.

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,439
As long as you never cross off anybody's name before they've given you what they owe you,

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,359
you'll always be making sure that you get every piece of work from every student.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,399
When collecting in the homework from students, you should go around to the students' desk individually,

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,659
collect each piece of homework and then write down the names of those who don't have it.

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,579
If you do this regularly, the students will quickly learn that you're the kind of teacher

41
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,819
who doesn't let things slide.

42
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,379
And they'll put you on the top of their own to-do lists.

43
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,799
The second thing to talk about are the daily must-do lists.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,999
On your computer, you should make a Word document that has a blank page for each workday.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,819
On those pages, you're going to put down the things that must happen by the end of that day,

46
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,099
in order to be fully prepared for the next day.

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,279
So as an example, every Monday, you need to list all of the classes that you need to plan for on Tuesday.

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,159
If there's anything else that needs to be done before Tuesday, also put that on that list.

49
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,999
The thing that really makes this work is that it is a must-do list. This is not a daily to-do list.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,259
You're not putting down things that you would like to get done by the end of the day,

51
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,319
but that are ultimately optional.

52
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,999
You need to put down things that have to get done.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,139
I like to think of this as my "I must do this before I can go home list".

54
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,639
If you limit your list to only the things that absolutely have to get done,

55
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,279
it's much more motivating to knock those things off, so you know you can go home at the end of the day

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,719
and not have to be worrying all night about what you need to do first thing in the morning

57
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,339
to be ready for the day.

58
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,979
The last thing to keep on the clipboard is a general to-do list. This is a list for everything that doesn't fit

59
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,339
on your must-do list.

60
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,379
Anything that is less time sensitive goes on here. Any general project that you need to do at some point,

61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,739
but not by a specific day will all be kept track of on here.

62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,899
After you've crossed off your must-do list, then you would turn over to your general to-do list

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,459
and start working through those items, if you have time.

64
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,539
The next thing I want to talk about is paperwork.

65
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,199
Teachers deal with a lot of paper and you have to have a system for keeping it all together.

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,259
This is what I recommend. You should have one folder for each class that you teach.

67
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,339
Within that folder, you're going to keep all of the papers that you currently need to teach that class.

68
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,659
So, any worksheets that you're going to give out, any tests you're going to give out,

69
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,719
homework that you've gotten back and need to mark, all of those kinds of things go into this folder.

70
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,559
Any reference materials that you wouldn't need on a particular day to teach that class,

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,779
such as workbooks that you use to photocopy the worksheets from,

72
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,299
those you can keep in a separate filing cabinet.

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,958
Here's an example of the kind of thing to keep inside one of the folders. This is a collection of papers

74
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,999
that's for a Year 10 test.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,779
There's three parts to this little packet, so let's take a look at them.

76
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,099
First, there's the papers themselves.

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,359
Secondly, there's a title sheet that clearly describes what they are. In this example, Year 10 Tests.

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,999
And lastly, there's a cover slip which keeps all of these things together.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,179
If you leave a lot of blank space on your cover sheet, you can add additional information later on,

80
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,419
such as when you've given the test to the students and received them back, you can add To Mark

81
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,319
on the front of that sheet, so that you know you need to take care of this.

82
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,519
And once you've marked them, you can then cross that out.

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,059
Again, to quickly review, keep one folder for each of your classes, and keep all of the things that you need to teach

84
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,099
that class in that folder.

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,919
Once you set up this system, you know that you just need that single folder to be adequately prepared

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,539
for the class.

87
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,979
This is also convenient, in case there's a room change. You can just grab that folder and go.

88
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,739
If you're able to organize your files in the ways that I've just recommended,

89
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,739
and you're able to consistently work with your daily must-do list, the advantage is that when you walk into

90
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,939
school on any day, you know that you're completely ready for whatever's going to happen.

91
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,539
You don't have to spend any of your day frantically planning for that afternoon lesson,

92
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,539
and if anything comes up unexpectedly, you don't have to worry about it, because you're all set

93
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,519
for every one of your lessons for that day.

94
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,579
Once you start getting used to this ready position, you'll find that you have more time in the day than you actually

95
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,459
originally thought. One of the places that time has been hiding from you is in these little five minute intervals

96
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,079
between lessons.

97
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,459
After the last class leaves and before the next class comes in, you can use this time in a productive way

98
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,779
if you're prepared adequately.

99
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,079
I recommend that you keep a list of things that you can do in these little five minute times.

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,959
For example, you can do some quick filing or, if you have an easy to mark quiz, you can mark a couple of those

101
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,179
pages in that quiz.

102
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,019
After a full day of teaching, you can sometimes find that you've marked a complete class set of quizzes

103
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,699
without ever feeling like you had to sit down and mark the whole thing at once.

104
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,459
I want you to realize as a teacher that your job is a lot less clear than other jobs.

105
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,579
If you think of a factory worker, they have a clearly defined shift, which is nine to five

106
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,199
and they're producing a tangible product, such as a car.

107
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,839
You know when the car is done because all of the pieces have been fit together.

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,819
Being a teacher is not like this. If you're working on something like making presentations

109
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,179
or making a test for a class or a worksheet, this kind of work can really go on forever.

110
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,159
You can always make a presentation a little bit snappier or you can always make a worksheet a little bit clearer.

111
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,139
When you're making something like a worksheet, at some point, the worksheet is going to be serviceable.

112
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,239
It's going to be completely adequate for the educational aim that you're trying to achieve.

113
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,799
If you're going to continue working, you really need to stop and think for a moment.

114
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,099
Would I better spend my time making this worksheet absolutely perfect?

115
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,539
Or would my time be better spent moving on to something else?

116
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,099
Most of the time, the answer is the latter. You're better off having two satisfactory worksheets

117
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,099
for two different classes than one perfect worksheet for one class, but no worksheet for the other one.

118
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,579
Now let's talk about sick days. Teachers have one of the lowest absentee rates of any profession.

119
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,579
And I don't think that's because teachers are more healthy than most people.

120
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,439
It's because, as a teacher, sometimes missing a day of work is more of a hassle than just going in,

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,439
no matter how poorly you may be feeling.

122
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,239
Because of this, teachers don't often take days off work until they're feeling really poor.

123
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,819
Do yourself a favor as a teacher. Spend some time creating lessons to be used in your absence

124
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,359
ahead of time.

125
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,199
If you make them before you need them, when you actually are sick, you can just call in the school

126
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,219
and tell them, "There's a file in my filing cabinet. It's called cover work. Everything you need is in there."

127
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,499
Then you can hang up the phone, crawl back into bed and spend your day getting better,

128
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,859
as opposed to spending your day worrying about what your students are actually going to do.

129
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,139
The last thing I want to talk about is how big projects get done.

130
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,079
Something like a cathedral doesn't just pop into existence. It gets built very slowly over time,

131
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,079
one brick by one brick.

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,499
It's a good idea to try and carve out at least twenty minutes, maybe thirty minutes, everyday

133
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,519
to work on a long term project that's beneficial to you and your career.

134
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,739
For example, if there's a new computer skill that you need to learn, if you just spend twenty minutes a day

135
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,079
on it, you can make real progress on something like that over time.

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,479
If you set aside daily time to work on your long term projects, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much

137
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,279
you can accomplish. When you look back in six months or a year, you'll be amazed at what you've done.

138
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,319
And lastly, don't forget why it is you became a teacher in the first place.

139
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,540
The summer holidays.
