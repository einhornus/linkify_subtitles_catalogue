00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,659
Hello Internet,

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:06,088
Here we are: 500,000 subscribers -- well,
actually... by the time I finished this video

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,379
it's a bit more than that -- but who knew
that after I promised to do a Q&A that the

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,339
pope would resign?

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,929
Anyway...

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,729
When I uploaded my first explanation video
just over two years ago now, I would never

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,379
have expented this: over half a million subscribers
and 16 videos with over a million views. Who

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,309
knew rapidly spoken educational videos could
be so popular?

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,389
Thank you, Internet.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,959
Now, as promised -- though slighly behind
schedule -- it's time to answer some of your

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,168
questions.

12
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:29,848
## "What's your educational background?" Rodrigo,
Campo Grande, Brazil

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,179
I went to school in New York where I earned
two college degrees, one in physics and one

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,769
in sociology. After that I moved to London
and earned a PGCE in Science Education, and

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,829
became a qualified physics teacher in England.

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,689
## "How long does it take to create a video?"
Tracey, Ohio

17
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,799
I've tracked my time to get an accurate answer
and every minute of final video you see takes

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,719
me between 10 and 20 hours of writing and
animating to make. So a typical 5 minute video

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,449
is 50 to 100 hours of work.

20
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,869
While that's a lot, it doesn't include the
research phase which is difficult to quantify

21
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,928
-- some of the videos I've made I'd been collecting
notes on for more than a year before starting.

22
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,679
## "What was you favourite video make?" Brittany
P, UK

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,809
The 2012 video was the most fun by far -- mainly
because I didn't have to do a lot of complicated

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,269
research and I got to complain about things
I don't like.

25
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,559
## "What change would you make to the education
system?" Lumbajack Gangsta, Austin, TX

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,939
Instead of grouping kids by age, I'd group
try grouping them by ability instead.

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,189
The idea that just because a kid is 14-years-old
they're ready for trigonometry is weird. No

28
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,549
other part of human society oranizes itself
this way and for good reason: it artificially

29
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,989
slows down the best and brightest.

30
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,679
## "What is do you think should be in the
curriculum but isn't?" Jamaal, Arizona

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,569
Computer programming. I was kind of shocked
and horrified when I started teaching in the

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,798
UK to discover there were no real computer
programming lessons.

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,908
Of course, there are only so many classes
in the day, and everyone wants their pet subject

34
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,469
taught in schools, so the equally important
question is what to get rid of to make room

35
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,989
for computer programming and, without the
slightest hesitation I'd ditch the foreign

36
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,169
languages classes -- after all, computer programming
is getting us closer and closer to a universal

37
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,158
translator anyway.

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,989
## "What do you do when you receive pennies?"
johnjac, Owasso

39
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,019
I die a little inside thinking about how political
systems can distribute tiny costs across large

40
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,019
numbers of people to the benefit of a few.

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,199
## "What's your favorite element?" Rasmus,
Denmark

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,559
I don't have a favorite but I'm irrationaly
fond of Tungsten mainly because my wedding

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,609
ring is made out of it.

44
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,269
## "What's the story behind your logo?" Joshua
B.

45
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,819
It's basically a personal flag for my love
of science and technology.

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,829
When I first started this channel, I thought
that I would make videos mostly about those

47
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,609
two things, but for various reasons, that
hasn't happened yet.

48
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,309
And besides, it's not like there's a shortage
of good science channels on YouTube.

49
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,759
By the way, If you really like the logo, you
can get it on T-Shirts and now coffee mugs

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,619
-- which is particularly appropriate as coffee
is the fuel that without which these videos

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,599
could not be made.

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,259
## "What do you do in your free time?" Sam
L, Higginsville, MO

53
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,829
I like to horseback ride through the mountains.

54
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,479
Nah, it's mostly just reddit.

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,309
Speaking of which...

56
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,629
## "Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized
horses or 1 horse-sized duck?" techtakular,

57
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,009
Alex, va

58
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,289
One horse-sized duck. The cube-squared law
means the legs of a horse-sized duck probably

59
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,458
wouldn't be structually sound. Easy fight.

60
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,439
## "Are there going to be more "politics in
the animal kingdom" videos?" Oli

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,169
Yes, I'm sorry, I know this playlist is unfinished
and, if any of the videos videos I've ever

62
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,219
made can be said to be important, it's these.

63
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,249
I promise at least one more about the single
transferable vote, but I don't make any promises

64
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,359
about when that will happen.

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,458
## "Do you think third parties will ever gain
ground in the United States?" Kerl, Florida

66
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:56,729
No.

67
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,848
The problem isn't politics or voter apathy,
it's the system that creates the politics

68
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:01,598
and voter apathy.

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,519
The US election system is pretty much the
worst in the civilized world -- often voting

70
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,019
for a 3rd party isn't just a waste it's also
a vote *against* your own best interests.

71
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,099
3rd parties really can't thrive under those
conditions.

72
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,659
## "What's one technology you wish to see
before you die?" zigonick, MO, USA

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,488
Immortality technology.

74
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,509
## Where do you get your ideas?

75
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,509
It's been my experience that creative projects
are self-sustaining. The more you write, the

76
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,949
more things you want to write about and the
more you program the more programming ideas

77
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,509
you have.

78
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,128
For me each video spawns more videos. The
daylight saving one, for example, originally

79
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,268
contained spots for information about longitude
and time zones and the seasons that got cut

80
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,529
but will probably become their own videos
at some point.

81
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,389
Also, I listen to a monstrous number of audiobooks
and podcasts. If you're interested, you can

82
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,789
see some of my favorites here. These help
me keep in touch with the wider world and

83
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,399
expose me to ideas and information that I
would not have come across on my own.

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,889
## "If you could live at any time in history
when would it be?" Bonnie, Scotland

85
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,669
I wouldn't.

86
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,689
Allow me to summarieze all of human existance
with this single graph.

87
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,259
## "What's the best way be successful on YouTube?"
Joe Kowalski, 44074

88
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,929
Make videos people want to watch.

89
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,439
I'm not trying to be glib here but when asked
this question I see many YouTubers talk about

90
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,958
the importance of upload schedules and managing
your social media and colloborations, and

91
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,429
my experience says that's completely backwards.

92
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,128
If your videos aren't interesting, no one
will care that you upload them regularly.

93
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,829
And twitter followers don't get you views,
views get you twitter followers and people

94
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,379
who want to collaborate with you.

95
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,898
I know it's not very helpful advice, but it's
the most truthful advice I can give.

96
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,249
## "What is the most interesting fact you've
ever been told." Stu1278, England

97
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,749
It's difficult to pick just one from an entire
lifetime, but last year Veritasium visited

98
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,099
me in London and walked me thorugh the process
by which trees get water from their roots

99
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,059
to their leaves.

100
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,679
That sounds really boring but it was one of
the most mind-blowing conversations I've had

101
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,339
in a long time.

102
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,749
## "How often do you engage with profesionals
while you research?" theLarom, Washington,

103
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:37,929
DC

104
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,629
For me, being confused and frustrated with
a topic is a vital part of figuring out how

105
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,569
to explain it to others so I'd say 95% of
research I do on my own.

106
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,529
If I'm really out of my depth on a topic -- like
the debt video and the pope video -- I try

107
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,879
very hard to find an expert to look over the
final draft of my script but time constraints

108
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,589
and finding trustworthy experts is sometimes
a bit difficult.

109
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,629
## "What is your favorite internal organ?"
trint99, DFW, TX

110
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,279
The Brain -- because it's the one that's me.

111
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,019
## "Is there any part of science do you want
to be proven wrong?" Jrod N, Massacusetts

112
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,839
Yes, the current interpretations of the ultimate
fate of The Universe all make me sad.

113
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,019
## "Can you answer 10 questions in under 30
seconds?" YouReadMeName

114
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,219
## 1: "What is your favorite scientific study
ever published?" Marie, Reno, NV

115
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,198
Unskilled Are Unaware: Further Explorations
of (Absent)

116
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,629
Self-Insight Among the Incompetent

117
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,369
Link in the description.

118
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,809
## 2: "Hogwarts house?" Zeinoun Awad, Lebanon

119
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,529
Ravenclaw. (I'd hope)

120
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,728
## 3: "Celsius or Fahrenheit?" Kubez

121
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:18,969
Fahrenheit.

122
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,749
##4: Kirk or Picard

123
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:19,969
Picard.

124
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,469
## 5: "Do you wear glasses?" Spartacus McFancy
Pants

125
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:21,839
Uh, yeah.

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,948
## 6: "Favorite empire?" Caleb Glickman, USA

127
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,309
The second one. Those monks were awesome.

128
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,909
## 7: "How can a country be totally self sufficient
-- as in no imports or exports?" Amberjack1973

129
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,509
Simple, resort to a midevil level of technology.

130
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,659
## 8: "Favourite sport?" soccernhlfan, Canada

131
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:30,889
No.

132
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,719
## 9: "Should science play a bigger role in
politics?" Dip, London, UK

133
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,429
What, you mean the method by which we determine
truth? Yeah, I think it should.

134
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,299
## 10: "Can you answer 10 questions in under
30 seconds?" YouReadMeName

135
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,758
Apparently.

136
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,669
Alright, thanks to everyone who submitted
questions -- it's been fun, Internet.
