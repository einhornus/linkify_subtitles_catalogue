1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,299
The main video is talking about a genetic breeding model

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,679
of how to make machines learn.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,799
This method is simpler to explain or just show.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,459
Here is a machine learning to walk or play Mario or jump really high.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,059
A genetic code is an older code  but it still checks out

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,719
and I personally suspect in the future genetic models will have a resurgence as

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,339
compute power approaches crazy pants.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,459
However, the current hotness is deep learning and recursive neural networks and

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,859
that is where the linear algebra really increases

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,799
and explainability in a brief video really decreases.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,939
But if I had to kind of explain how they work

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,939
in a footnote, just for the record, it's like this:

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,699
No infinite warehouse. Just one student.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,599
Teacher Bot has the same test, but this time Builder Bot is 'Dial Adjustment Bot'

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,639
where each dial is how sensitive one connection in the student bot's head is.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,439
There's a lot of connections in its head so a lot of dials.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,899
A LOT, a lot.

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,459
Teacher Bot shows Student Bot a photo and Dial Adjustment Bot adjusts that dial

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,119
stronger or weaker to get Student Bot closer to the answer.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,599
It's a bit like adjusting the dial on a radio. Is that still a thing? Do cars have radios still?

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,939
I don't know, anyway. You might not know the exact frequency of the station

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,699
but you can tell if your getting closer or further away.

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,519
It's like that but with a hundred thousand dials and a lot of math,

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,479
and that's just for one test question.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,339
When Teacher Bot introduces the next photo,

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,399
Dial Adjustment Bot needs to adjust all the dials so that Student Bot can answer both questions.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,619
As the test gets longer,

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,899
this becomes an insane amount of math and fine tuning for Dial Adjustment Bot.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,839
But when it's done there's a student bot who

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,359
can do a pretty good job at recognizing new photos,

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,339
though still suffers from some of the problems mentioned in the main video.

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,839
Anyway, that the most babies' first introduction to neural networks you will ever hear.

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
If it sounds interesting to you and you like math and code,

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,179
go dig into the details;

35
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,879
machines that learn are the future of everything.

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,038
Maybe, quite literally, the future of everything,

37
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,098
and given what we've put them through, may the bots have mercy on us all.
