1
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:22,229
Okay enough of that. This is not going to be a cinematic vlog here,

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,528
I'm just showing you what I've been up to lately and right now.

3
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,249
I need to get from London to Las Vegas and back again in 72 hours.

4
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,388
This is guaranteed to be a jet lag disaster

5
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:40,639
But I have a plan. My body is going to Vegas but my sleep cycle is going to stay in London on

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,509
GMT - Grey Master Time. I'm changing continents, but not changing time zones

7
00:00:46,510 --> 00:01:08,559
I think this is a great idea. Everyone I know thinks this is ridiculous, but I'm going to give it a shot let's go

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,959
What the heck is that?

9
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,449
Planes wander around on the runway for a long time so you always have to check and see when it is going to be real

10
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,869
It's real! Okay. This is future Grey here editing this video and who obviously survived the flight.

11
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,149
I'm not normally worried about the actual plane,

12
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:31,039
this is not where my travel anxieties come from, but look at the wing of this plane as it takes off.

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,589
It really bends quite a lot from the original position. Now, I have flown a bunch,

14
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,459
I don't remember ever seeing this kind of thing before, and I found it extremely

15
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,119
concerning. Normally, this is the exact moment where my travel anxieties end, once the plane is in the air

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,889
I can just sit back and read or work or whatever, and just feel like I have a bunch of time on my own.

17
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,399
But I couldn't help but keep looking at this wing and how much it bent. Is this normal?

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,979
It doesn't seem normal. Anyway, back to past Grey, who's actually on the plane.

19
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,329
The very vlog that I hope you're watching right now is something

20
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,148
I'm thinking of trying to do on this trip as like an additional thing

21
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,539
But I got to tell you this wing outside the plane is

22
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,899
Extremely concerning. Like, it's not just me, right? It's really bent

23
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,609
Okay, I've been working on the vlog for a little while, but if this plan is going to work

24
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,959
I need to get to sleep because there's only six and a half hours of flight time remaining

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,759
It's noon o'clock in Las Vegas and eight o'clock in London which is a little early, but I've brought sleeping pills of unconsciousness

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:44,999
They're blue, as all such pills are legally required to be

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,159
Oh god, it's really early.

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:16,518
Alright. I've gotta get up. I'll make make up some sleep in the hotel.

29
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:36,289
Traveling into the U.S. sucks. This is where I protect my phone. This is where I protect myself.

30
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,848
Vegas, baby.

31
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:40,759
Alright, it took me way longer to get through the airport than I was expecting.

32
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,059
It's almost 4:00 in the morning in London, but it's almost 8:00 p.m.

33
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,519
in Las Vegas

34
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:53,239
and I wanted to sleep a little bit when I got in, but I don't have time because I have a dinner to get to at

35
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,699
8:30. Okay, future Grey here. I did make it to the dinner on time, but I didn't film it

36
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,869
So here's some stock footage of puppies instead, and now that we're taking this little break

37
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,719
I'm going to let past Grey explain exactly what the plan is, in detail

38
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,388
Let's take a look at London and let's take a look at Las Vegas. 1:00 a.m. in London is 5:00 p.m.

39
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:16,148
in Las Vegas. Drawing out the rest of the hours gets us at this relationship between the times. Around 10 o'clock

40
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:22,158
I am definitely asleep, which, expanding to eight hours later, gets us to around 6:00 in the morning, when I'm usually

41
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:27,228
waking up. This means in Las Vegas, I'm going to be asleep from about 2:00 in the afternoon until

42
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:32,978
10:00 p.m.. My 8 or 9 o'clock at night is still lunch time for people in Las Vegas

43
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:37,509
So I'm definitely available then but if I'm willing to take away 2 hours of sleep

44
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,109
I can actually make it for the time when most people want to have dinner,

45
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,029
which is 8 o'clock at night. Normally that's my nightmare; having dinner at 8:00;

46
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,329
But this time, it's working in my favor. Crazy normal people like to stay up until midnight,

47
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,189
which I could never possibly do, but now this is looking like a real possibility.

48
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:01,908
Their midnight is just my 8 in the morning at which, I've already been awake for 3 hours anyway on London time.

49
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:08,658
So there's a big overlap during this section even better when they go to bed it means I have the rest of a full

50
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:14,108
Working day essentially on my own. No one's going to be around at 4 a.m. in Las Vegas,

51
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:19,139
[I] can just be doing whatever I want. It's my lunchtime normal business hours start at 9:00 a.m.

52
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,079
Which is my 5:00 in the afternoon. So as far as I'm concerned, this actually works perfectly.

53
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,939
I can see people in the beginning of the work day. I can meet people for their lunch

54
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,069
I can be around for people's dinners

55
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,989
And I actually get to be the guy who can stay up late for post-dinner socializing, a first in my life

56
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,129
And I get a whole chunk of time to myself. I don't see how it could possibly go wrong

57
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,259
the only thing I need to do is just make sure I don't fall asleep at the wrong time

58
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,459
Dinner over which was my breakfast. I'm pretty tired, but it's

59
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,999
10:40 a.m.. On Grey Master Time I can't fall asleep

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,469
I'm going out for a walk to actually see Vegas for a little bit

61
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,419
Vegas really is the city where I think this plan can work because if there's one place that

62
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,319
doesn't want you to know what time it really is, its Las Vegas. The walk helped, now

63
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,819
it's time to take advantage of everybody being asleep, but I need to find

64
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,289
bingo

65
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:57,279
Target acquired time to return to home base and edit an episode of Hello Internet.

66
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,189
The funny set up, but it works

67
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:06,329
Alright. I'm getting pretty tired when I shouldn't be so I'm just standing in the sun for a while to remind my brain to stay

68
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,959
Awake before heading off to meet some people for breakfast and then lunch

69
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,479
But I didn't film that so here's a sleepy hedgehog instead. Alright, it's 9:30 in London even though

70
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,609
it's only 1:30 in Las Vegas and I am

71
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,489
Exhausted, it's been a long day

72
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,269
I've lost more sleep than I expected because of the flight and the time it took to get to the airport

73
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:35,769
But at least one day has been successfully accomplished, but now I am going to bed

74
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,889
Okay this is the first time that I'm waking up actually according to the schedule so far so good

75
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:46,449
I have a 9:30 dinner that I need to go catch. Which is actually going to be my breakfast

76
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,709
You know the drill people stayed up until way late this time

77
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,789
I'm never the guy who gets to close down a party because I'm mister in my pajamas at 8 p.m.

78
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,439
But now the tables have turned and I can be the last one who stays awake

79
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,879
I have the whole day ahead of me

80
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,639
But I'm skipping to the end because I don't want to spend my whole day filming things, but I saw a big shoe

81
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,519
I saw some robots taking her job

82
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,319
Took a car, met some people for their lunch and my dinner

83
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,799
and now I need to go to bed pretty quick because I need to wake up earlier to catch a final dinner here.

84
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,479
*GROAN*

85
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,029
The first few minutes of waking up are not great normally,

86
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,209
But when you have to wake up just a little bit earlier, It makes a big difference

87
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,808
But I know just just get into the shower

88
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:39,119
and get going. I was a little bit late and a little bit lost trying to find my way to dinner

89
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,918
But boy, was it worth it.

90
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,819
My steak for dinner breakfast is over and this is my last morning in Las Vegas, and there's something I want to do

91
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,609
What is the vlog without a montage?

92
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:58,119
So I'm grabbing a car to the other end of the strip and I'm going to film my way back as the sun rises

93
00:08:58,120 --> 00:11:46,899
Walk with me

94
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,819
It has been a pretty great time in Vegas

95
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,249
I spent the rest of the day just packing and getting ready to go which is

96
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:59,329
Totally uninteresting and now I'm setting my alarm and a timer because I have to get up very early

97
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,609
To catch the flight home

98
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,209
Future Grey here because past Grey didn't have a whole lot of time between when he woke up, when he had to get in the

99
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,899
car and when he had to get to the airport. It wasn't close close

100
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,509
But it was a lot closer than I would normally cut these kind of things the flight was at Las Vegas 10 p.m.

101
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,519
Time which was London 6 a.m.

102
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,209
Time and this flight home turned out to be the hardest part of maintaining Grey

103
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,939
Master Time this was a night flight back all of the lights were turned off

104
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,859
I was darkness the entire time the plane was in the air for what had been 7 a.m.

105
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,599
For me, but I had already been up since about 3:00 a.m.

106
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,099
Getting ready to go to the airport and boy did I want to sleep

107
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,429
To make matters worse the power in my seat didn't work for the vast majority of the flight

108
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,649
So I was just counting down the time

109
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,299
I had left on my laptop

110
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,539
To work to give me something productive to do instead of just sitting there in the darkness trying not to fall asleep

111
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,719
But thankfully the nice flight attendants kept bringing me many many cups of coffee and eventually got the power

112
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,179
in the seat next to mine

113
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,799
working so that I could keep doing stuff.

114
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,779
The sun did come up which really helped

115
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,479
And then we flew above the clouds for quite a while and

116
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,139
Nine hours later descended through them into the ever bright and beautiful England

117
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,079
then back through a much easier security,

118
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,469
trains, and eventually home to a normal day where I could go to bed

119
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,839
Where I was going to wake up the next morning to see if this test was successful

120
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:42,399
Was I able to go to Las Vegas and come back without disrupting my regular sleep cycle?

121
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,399
Woke up to a foggy London this morning.

122
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,839
I know people think the city always looks like this, but in my time living here it rarely does

123
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,889
So I always try to appreciate a good fog when it comes in. I'm a little tired

124
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,979
which is to be expected given that I've cut at least two hours of sleep off each night for the past three days

125
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,319
but the very fact that I am

126
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,759
Awake in London at this time in the morning after coming back from America

127
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,109
It feels like a miracle

128
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,489
Normally when I come back from America, I sleep in really late, I feel really terrible

129
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,569
I'm just jet-lagged and I'm totally unproductive for a week

130
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,569
but right now the plan is to head into a cafe and

131
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:31,299
Work on one of the final drafts for the next video that's going up. That's a huge relief that

132
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,679
this trip didn't destroy a week's worth of productivity and

133
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,019
I don't know if I'll do it

134
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,519
But I feel like it opens up the possibility of doing shorter trips to America in the future. We'll see

135
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,609
As for this vlog that you may or may not be watching I don't know if I'm going to finish it

136
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,699
I don't know if I do finish it if I'll put it up on the channel and

137
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,169
In particular, I don't know if I put it up on the channel that people will like it

138
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:56,939
but for now

139
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,208
It's been at least an interesting fun side project to have

140
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:07,929
That's like a little bit of a secret which you dear potential future viewer may or may not be in on

141
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,130
But right now. I'm going to enjoy the rest of this beautiful morning
