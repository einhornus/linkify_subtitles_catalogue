1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,065
Pandemic season. 

2
00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:02,212
This is not the first, 

3
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:03,719
nor will it be the last time, 

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,265
you lock yourself down and we isolate from each other

5
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,519
to protect ourselves

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,145
and to protect those more vulnerable than ourselves.

7
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:13,985
The practical effect of this isolation on you

8
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:16,505
is that your home is no longer your home,

9
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:19,039
but has transformed into a vessel that, 

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,332
along with many others, 

11
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,505
has left Earth to orbit around her.

12
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,092
Alone, together.

13
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:26,492
Those remaining on Earth have their mission, 

14
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,092
to mitigate the dangers of the outside.

15
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:30,692
And while here inside, 

16
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:34,185
it may seem like you have naught to do but watch and wait,

17
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:35,585
aboard this ship, 

18
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:38,519
isolated for a season with length unknown,

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,969
there are dangers too. 

20
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,119
What can start as a break from life, will, unchecked,

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,985
become something much worse.

22
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:48,852
Darkness and disorder and a slow drift into abyss, 

23
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:52,519
where, out here, no one can physically help you.

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,132
So, you cannot just wait. 

25
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:57,505
Like those below, you above have things to do.

26
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:59,919
Eventually Earth will need people to return, 

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,385
to help spin back up the wheels of the human world. 

28
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:06,132
Your mission: return better than you left. 

29
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,292
To accomplish this, you must maintain the vessel.

30
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:11,865
Welcome aboard Spaceship You.

31
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:15,239
The core generator of Spaceship You is your health, 

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,119
with two parts: the physical and the mental. 

33
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,132
For the ship to stay functional, this generator must spin. 

34
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:24,012
Arriving in orbit, it starts with some momentum

35
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:25,825
to keep things going at first, 

36
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:28,159
to afford a little time to adjust.

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,519
But as with all motion, 

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,452
the passive forces of the universe work to slow that which is active, 

39
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:35,452
to bring darkness and disorder.

40
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,519
If the core slows too much, 

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,639
if it all drifts too far and becomes too dark, 

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,012
recovery on your own is increasingly unlikely.

43
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:47,599
So, how to prime the core, and keep it running during this journey.

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,599
The mental and physical are halves of a whole, 

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,359
so accelerating one accelerates the other.

46
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,279
Each adds to the total momentum, 

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,099
making additional pushing easier, priming the core, 

48
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,759
creating motion, making light and order.

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,039
While you could start with either side, 

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,012
if the core is low, prime with the physical half.  

51
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:06,639
It has sturdier grips.  

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,532
The mental half, 

53
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,945
while vital for the higher operations of the ship, 

54
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:12,079
is a slipperier place to start.

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,319
You are on your own.

56
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,145
Your brain and how it thinks are all you have. 

57
00:02:16,146 --> 00:02:19,532
And brains, when dangerously apathetic or agitated, 

58
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,132
usually can't just think themselves better.

59
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,132
Brains are complicated messes, 

60
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:28,092
but physical activity is simple and brings brains back to baseline.

61
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:31,105
When the ship is in trouble, prime with the physical.

62
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:33,239
OK, now what?

63
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,479
Back in the before time, 

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,905
you may not have noticed how much 

65
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,279
your physical environment determined what you did. 

66
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,852
The library helped you study.

67
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:40,999
The office helped you work.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,612
The vacation helped you relax.

69
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,332
The couch helped you… couch. 

70
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,799
Then, as now, getting yourself to the right physical space

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,065
at the right time is a big part of the job of existing.

72
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:54,279
Yet, here you are, in one all-room.

73
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,185
Thus, the first task is to divide your physical space.

74
00:02:57,186 --> 00:02:58,665
No matter how small your vessel,

75
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,665
there will be at least four sides 

76
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,292
to create four vital stations to operate the ship.

77
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,185
The first is for exercise.

78
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,919
Something… beyond the bare minimum to survive.

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,052
So that priming the core is easier when you need to.

80
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:15,385
Create this simplest station first.  

81
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:16,532
It doesn't need to be big.

82
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:17,919
It doesn't need equipment to start.

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,265
It just needs to be empty.  

84
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,799
Your communicator contains more than enough

85
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,572
body weight exercises you can start today.

86
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:25,892
From this point on, 

87
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:28,252
crossing this border is how you mentally

88
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:30,745
and physically decide to do the exercise.  

89
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:32,812
Now, depending on the kind of person you are,

90
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,465
exercise will feel like bitter medicine at first,

91
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,465
speaking from deep experience here.

92
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:41,092
But you are on a solo mission in space.

93
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:45,985
The generator your life depends on requires physical effort to operate.

94
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:48,545
Exercise is non-optional.

95
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:50,545
While Spaceship You is isolated, 

96
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,425
there are resupplies available.

97
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:55,159
A small amount of equipment, after decontamination,

98
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,639
can make a big difference. 

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,559
If your ship is lucky enough to have access to a biosphere,

100
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,279
be sure to use that as well.

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,332
Your exercise station is a vital part of returning better than before,

102
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,532
whatever else might happen on this journey.

103
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,999
The next station to create is sleep.  

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,799
Unlike exercise, it's not simple to just lie down

105
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,239
and one, two, three… [fingers snap] …sleep.  

106
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,359
So to help this process you create and respect, even sanctify, 

107
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,652
the sleep station boundaries as where you go to sleep only.

108
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:26,492
If you use the sleep station to keep up with social media, 

109
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:29,332
or watch stuff, or eat, or all at once, 

110
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,812
you degrade the station. 

111
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,812
Degrade your ability to sleep.

112
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:34,809
Degrade mission success. 

113
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,065
Maintaining hygiene out here is important.

114
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:39,679
And the hygiene of the stations is part of that.

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,279
With sleep hygiene often the most difficult.  

116
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,825
Even if you respect the area, your brain may chatter away, not cooperating.  

117
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:48,945
You can distract it with a sleepy novel.

118
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:50,479
Or maybe a sleepy listen. 

119
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,585
But if it does not yield within thirty minutes, leave.  

120
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,105
Try again later.

121
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:58,265
This is where you go to sleep, not to linger,

122
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,985
worrying about how you can’t.  

123
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,399
It will be hard at first.

124
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,465
But like exercise, the more you do only the sanctified activity

125
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,025
within the sanctified borders, 

126
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:09,492
the more the sanctified station can help you

127
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:10,959
accomplish what you want. 

128
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,132
And you must get a handle on sleep.

129
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,705
Without the constraints of Earth, 

130
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:17,185
you will drift into a random sleep schedule.

131
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,892
Which will make it harder to sleep.

132
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:20,092
Which drains the core.

133
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,092
Which makes everything else harder.

134
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:25,559
Keep your sleep connected to Earth with an alarm for getting up. 

135
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,972
Again, bitter medicine.

136
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,825
But, out here, you must create your own structure

137
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:31,225
to accomplish the mission.

138
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:34,279
And you can set the alarm for whatever feels right.

139
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,825
It is the consistent waking time that matters.

140
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:40,679
That acts as the psychological anchor point across the coming days.

141
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,265
Your mission clock now has a start time, with sleep and exercise. 

142
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,972
But that leaves a lot of open hours.

143
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,025
What to do?

144
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:52,185
Well, you're probably watching this from your default station: couch,

145
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,879
which comes pre-installed on all vessels.

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,292
It's pretty comfy, 

147
00:05:56,293 --> 00:06:00,572
and NetMeTube+ does have a tetra-trillion hours of streaming video,

148
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,172
much of which is amazing.

149
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:05,199
And you do have a lot of time.

150
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,199
[with emphasis]
But, but... 

151
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,439
You will, burn through the list of things you truly enjoy surprisingly fast. 

152
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,585
The stream of streaming looks infinite, but it isn't.

153
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:18,959
And getting to the effective end of things worth watching

154
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,572
is a mixed achievement get.

155
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:24,465
You’ll then have stuff just on, half watching,

156
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,332
slumping down, not really paying attention.

157
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,929
Perhaps along with some games

158
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,759
that can easily eat into the hours

159
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,652
and hide the current state of the core.

160
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:36,865
Such that you don’t notice until too late, you’ve started to drift.

161
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,865
Couch contains twin dangers. 

162
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,385
This lapse into lethargy, 

163
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:42,745
along with the amping of anxiety.

164
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:44,119
When things are bad on Earth 

165
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,719
it's natural to want to follow every development, every detail, 

166
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,772
which can descend into a self-irradiation with novel anxieties

167
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:55,265
and angers over that which you can not affect.  

168
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:59,612
This unactionable agitation de-baselines the brain and drains the core.

169
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:00,292
Look around you.  

170
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:02,292
This is your actionable environment.  

171
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:04,145
So, take action from couch.  

172
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:07,929
Tidy it and sanctify the boundaries of a new recreation station

173
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,649
where you will engage with entertainment you enjoy, 

174
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,332
when actually giving it your full attention,

175
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,332
or fun that’s really fun,

176
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,839
or leisure where you feel better for having done it.

177
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,959
This is also a good spot to have communicator coffee chats.

178
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,372
Not quite the same as the real thing, but palliative and, 

179
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:27,852
others in their ships are more open to them than you might expect.

180
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:30,239
When it's recreation time, see who is around.

181
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,199
This station should be a refreshing place, 

182
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,479
but it does have a tendency to become a bit blah

183
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,012
and spread out more than the others if left unchecked.

184
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,679
So while with sleep, you want to schedule consistent time.  

185
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,719
with exercise you need to make sure you’re spending a minimum of time,

186
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,305
with recreation keep an eye on the maximum and the quality of time.

187
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:56,065
Now, taking action within your radius brings us to the final station: creation.

188
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:58,439
Before discussing the inside of this border,

189
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,569
recognize you’ve already done creation outside,

190
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,505
creating the environment around yourself to be useful to yourself.

191
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:09,559
Starting a feedback loop where you affect the environment positively

192
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,039
and the environment positively affects you.

193
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,159
So while creation station will have borders like the others,

194
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,692
the ultimate scope of your potential creation is

195
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:21,585
everything you have the power to affect, which includes yourself.

196
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:25,079
It is here where, through work, you can create things humans value.  

197
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,079
Through study and research… knowledge.

198
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,719
Through practice… skills.

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,492
Depending on what your Earth work is, 

200
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,865
you might be able to continue that up here. 

201
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:36,331
If so, you’re remotely helping keep the wheels of the world turning

202
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,812
by creating or doing what others value. 

203
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:41,839
If a student, continue learning and expanding and demonstrating

204
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,132
your ability to accomplish what is required, 

205
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,465
creating, improving your future self.  

206
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:49,359
But if your work or studies can’t be done in isolation,

207
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,812
you’re still going to create something. 

208
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:55,452
You have all the hours you need to pursue new skills

209
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,172
to become better at something then you were before.  

210
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:02,732
Which is how this station keeps the mental half of the core in top shape.  

211
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,745
This station will be the most different depending

212
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:07,945
on who you are and what you want to do or achieve.  

213
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,145
Crafts are creation.

214
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,492
Coding is creation.

215
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:11,332
So is cooking.  

216
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,759
This station is up to you, which can be a bit daunting.

217
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,199
But one suggestion.

218
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,919
In a funny way, this station is like sleep. 

219
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,199
One, two, three… [fingers snap] …work.  Doesn’t work.

220
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,692
So, just like sleep, keep this station especially hygienic.  

221
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,879
Clear of everything except what to focus on.

222
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,025
Crossing the border only to create, not to consume.

223
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,119
Do not watch NetMeTube+ here!

224
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,665
You have a place for that.  

225
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,425
If you’re too tempted, get up and leave.  That’s ok.

226
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,465
It’s better to be honest and keep the borders strict.

227
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:46,239
Don’t even consume food during creation.  

228
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,019
Go when you need that break.

229
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,625
Return when you’re ready.

230
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:52,225
Like with sleep, this doesn’t happen instantly.

231
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:56,785
So allow yourself to be a bit bored at the start before slipping into it.

232
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,519
So, these are the four stations of the ship.

233
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,745
Make them feel like truly different spaces.  

234
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:06,532
Then as the only crew, maintain the stations,

235
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,639
and the stations will maintain you.

236
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,892
Each Spaceship You is different,

237
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,852
and figuring out how to best run it over the course of

238
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:17,092
the day, the week, or longer isn’t easy.  

239
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:20,492
At times you will fail and things will get worse.

240
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:21,385
That happens.

241
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:23,799
But there is no point in berating yourself.  

242
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,959
There is only one thing to do: keep the core spinning.

243
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,385
Complete the mission.

244
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:31,385
Come back better than before.

245
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:33,559
See you on Earth, Captain.

246
00:10:33,560 --> 00:11:00,240
[wistful ambient music fades slowly]
