Hello Internet,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,908
Enjoying your Internetting session?

3
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,499
Perhaps watching this video with lots of tabs
open and full of interesting things to check

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,499
out.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,058
The Internet is amazing and that's because
of the rules which govern how it works, an

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,029
important one of which is Net Neutrality:
treating all data equally.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,019
But some Internet Providers want to ditch
this rule to insert themselves betwixt you

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,159
and your data as the most meddlesome middlemen
in human history -- to their benefit and our

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,159
detriment.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,159
How?

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,049
Well think of the Internet as a series of
pipes.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,759
Some are ocean-and-continent spanning pipes
through which vast rivers of data flow.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,209
You don't get access to those -- they're very
expensive, and you couldn't handle it anyway.

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,499
But you do have a little pipe that connects
to the big pipes, through which you can pull

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,979
down and send out data.

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,998
Your pay your Internet provider to maintain
this pipe.

17
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:50,139
This rule means that your little pipe, cares
not what flows through it: cat videos, discussion

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,588
forums, calls or games.

19
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:55,588
Whatever you're doing, you're using the whole
pipe to do and no website gets preference

20
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:56,628
over another.

21
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,628
Everyone wants faster Internet, but that requires
more metaphorical pipe in the ground, the

22
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,968
building of which is slow and expensive.

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,639
Now you may have heard your Internet provider
on the news talking about how this rule prevents

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,419
them from building 'fast lanes' for special
kinds of data -- they want you to think they're

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,439
expanding your access to the information superhighway.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,529
But removing this rule also gives them the
power to speedbump the existing roads and

27
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,669
charge more to use the 'fast' lane that was
just what you had before.

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,489
The power to preference some data over others
is the power to favor one video site over

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,339
another and to limit a tiny part of the pipe
for the video you're watching right now or

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,759
trying to anyway.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,299
We've been through this before: and constrain
other companies in similar ways.

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,299
Take the electricity.

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,959
You pay for a certain amount and when it arrives
in your house you can do with it what you

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,959
wish.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,639
The electricity company doesn't get to decide
that rather than build more power plants it's

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,989
going to dim your bulbs and then offer a 'brighter
bulbs' monthly subscription.

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,749
And so it should go with the Internet.

38
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,149
Watts are watts and bits are bits and we'll
always need more and more.

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,879
And preserving this rule for the Internet
has much wider impact than just if some company

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,539
takes more of your coins.

41
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,569
Not to be overly dramatic here, but preserving
data equality may be one of the most important

42
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,239
issues in a generation.

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,079
Because without this rule Internet providers
could cripple competitors they don't like.

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,089
Ever notice the same company that sells you
internet also sells Cable TV and Landlines

45
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,378
-- stuff The Internet totally replaces?

46
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:22,059
Without data equality your Internet Provider
could narrow the pipe for competitors until

47
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,718
they either go out of business, pay the meddlesome
middleman, or both.

48
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,848
It's like if one store in town super-promised
to pay for fast roads everywhere as long as

49
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,109
the town gave them absolute power over all
the roads no backsies.

50
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,199
If you agree to that deal don't be surprised
when years later all traffic to them is fast

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,888
and free while the roads elsewhere are slow
and neglected.

52
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:46,759
This town is basically the Internet without
net neutrality which some Internet Providers

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,169
would love, but actual Internet citizens,
not so much.

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,078
Having the pipes treat all data the same lets
one guy with a good idea and a bit of programming

55
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,729
knowledge make something today that's seen
by millions tomorrow.

56
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,408
But only because his data is treated equally
with everything else in the pipes.

57
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,059
An Internet that treats data equally is an
internet that continues to shower us with

58
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,059
wonder.

59
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,979
But an Internet where middlemen pick and choose
what comes through the pipe is an Internet

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,828
of stagnation for all and profit for few.

61
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:16,218
Which is why some Internet providers will
always want that control, so the cost of preserving

62
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:21,378
our awesome Internet is eternal vigilance
on the part of good citizens to defend Net

63
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,249
Neutrality.
