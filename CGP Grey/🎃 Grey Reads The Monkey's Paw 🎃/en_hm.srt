# The Monkey's Paw

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,888
by W. W. Jacobs

3
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:10,419
Without, the night was cold and wet, but in
the small parlour of Laburnam Villa the blinds

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:16,019
were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father
and son were at chess, the former, who possessed

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,489
ideas about the game involving radical changes,
putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,428
perils that it even provoked comment from
the white-haired old lady knitting placidly

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,428
by the fire.

8
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:32,109
"Hark at the wind," said Mr. White, who, having
seen a fatal mistake after it was too late,

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,559
was amiably desirous of preventing his son
from seeing it.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,759
"I'm listening," said the latter, grimly surveying
the board as he stretched out his hand. "Check."

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,869
"I should hardly think that he'd come to-night,"
said his father, with his hand poised over

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,869
the board.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,259
"Mate," replied the son.

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,479
"That's the worst of living so far out," bawled
Mr. White, with sudden and unlooked-for violence;

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,538
"of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way
places to live in, this is the worst. Pathway's

16
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,279
a bog, and the road's a torrent. I don't know
what people are thinking about. I suppose

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,978
because only two houses in the road are let,
they think it doesn't matter."

18
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,408
"Never mind, dear," said his wife, soothingly;
"perhaps you'll win the next one."

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,118
Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time
to intercept a knowing glance between mother

20
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,209
and son. The words died away on his lips,
and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,209
beard.

22
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,369
"There he is," said Herbert White, as the
gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps

23
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,048
came toward the door.

24
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,319
The old man rose with hospitable haste, and
opening the door, was heard condoling with

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,968
the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled
with himself, so that Mrs. White said, "Tut,

26
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:41,368
tut!" and coughed gently as her husband entered
the room, followed by a tall, burly man, beady

27
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,379
of eye and rubicund of visage.

28
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,529
"Sergeant-Major Morris," he said, introducing
him.

29
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,078
The sergeant-major shook hands, and taking
the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly

30
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,879
while his host got out whiskey and tumblers
and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,539
At the third glass his eyes got brighter,
and he began to talk, the little family circle

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,209
regarding with eager interest this visitor
from distant parts, as he squared his broad

33
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,579
shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes
and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,339
strange peoples.

35
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,229
"Twenty-one years of it," said Mr. White,
nodding at his wife and son. "When he went

36
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,659
away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse.
Now look at him."

37
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,719
"He don't look to have taken much harm," said
Mrs. White, politely.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,419
"I'd like to go to India myself," said the
old man, "just to look round a bit, you know."

39
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,908
"Better where you are," said the sergeant-major,
shaking his head. He put down the empty glass,

40
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:33,848
and sighing softly, shook it again.

41
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,579
"I should like to see those old temples and
fakirs and jugglers," said the old man. "What

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,458
was that you started telling me the other
day about a monkey's paw or something, Morris?"

43
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,689
"Nothing," said the soldier, hastily. "Leastways
nothing worth hearing."

44
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,149
"Monkey's paw?" said Mrs. White, curiously.

45
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,249
"Well, it's just a bit of what you might call
magic, perhaps," said the sergeant-major,

46
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,249
offhandedly.

47
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,238
His three listeners leaned forward eagerly.
The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty

48
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,339
glass to his lips and then set it down again.
His host filled it for him.

49
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,369
"To look at," said the sergeant-major, fumbling
in his pocket, "it's just an ordinary little

50
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,289
paw, dried to a mummy."

51
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,949
He took something out of his pocket and proffered
it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,329
her son, taking it, examined it curiously.

53
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,669
"And what is there special about it?" inquired
Mr. White as he took it from his son, and

54
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,929
having examined it, placed it upon the table.

55
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,628
"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir,"
said the sergeant-major, "a very holy man.

56
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,059
He wanted to show that fate ruled people's
lives, and that those who interfered with

57
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,329
it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell
on it so that three separate men could each

58
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,119
have three wishes from it."

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,298
His manner was so impressive that his hearers
were conscious that their light laughter jarred

60
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:42,298
somewhat.

61
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,009
"Well, why don't you have three, sir?" said
Herbert White, cleverly.

62
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,779
The soldier regarded him in the way that middle
age is wont to regard presumptuous youth.

63
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,419
"I have," he said, quietly, and his blotchy
face whitened.

64
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,578
"And did you really have the three wishes
granted?" asked Mrs. White.

65
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,899
"I did," said the sergeant-major, and his
glass tapped against his strong teeth.

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,839
"And has anybody else wished?" persisted the
old lady.

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,158
"The first man had his three wishes. Yes,"
was the reply; "I don't know what the first

68
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,848
two were, but the third was for death. That's
how I got the paw."

69
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,589
His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon
the group.

70
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,088
"If you've had your three wishes, it's no
good to you now, then, Morris," said the old

71
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,789
man at last. "What do you keep it for?"

72
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,049
The soldier shook his head. "Fancy, I suppose,"
he said, slowly. "I did have some idea of

73
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,850
selling it, but I don't think I will. It has
caused enough mischief already. Besides, people

74
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:35,079
won't buy. They think it's a fairy tale; some
of them, and those who do think anything of

75
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,989
it want to try it first and pay me afterward."

76
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,939
"If you could have another three wishes,"
said the old man, eyeing him keenly, "would

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,939
you have them?"

78
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,589
"I don't know," said the other. "I don't know."

79
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,109
He took the paw, and dangling it between his
forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon

80
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,189
the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped
down and snatched it off.

81
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,739
"Better let it burn," said the soldier, solemnly.

82
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,709
"If you don't want it, Morris," said the other,
"give it to me."

83
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,029
"I won't," said his friend, doggedly. "I threw
it on the fire. If you keep it, don't blame

84
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,759
me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire
again like a sensible man."

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,859
The other shook his head and examined his
new possession closely. "How do you do it?"

86
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,859
he inquired.

87
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,739
"Hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud,"
said the sergeant-major, "but I warn you of

88
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,739
the consequences."

89
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,449
"Sounds like the Arabian Nights," said Mrs.
White, as she rose and began to set the supper.

90
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,439
"Don't you think you might wish for four pairs
of hands for me?"

91
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,319
Her husband drew the talisman from pocket,
and then all three burst into laughter as

92
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,309
the sergeant-major, with a look of alarm on
his face, caught him by the arm.

93
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,739
"If you must wish," he said, gruffly, "wish
for something sensible."

94
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,729
Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and
placing chairs, motioned his friend to the

95
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,139
table. In the business of supper the talisman
was partly forgotten, and afterward the three

96
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,489
sat listening in an enthralled fashion to
a second instalment of the soldier's adventures

97
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,489
in India.

98
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,219
"If the tale about the monkey's paw is not
more truthful than those he has been telling

99
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,169
us," said Herbert, as the door closed behind
their guest, just in time for him to catch

100
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,609
the last train, "we sha'nt make much out of
it."

101
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,719
"Did you give him anything for it, father?"
inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband

102
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,719
closely.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,969
"A trifle," said he, colouring slightly. "He
didn't want it, but I made him take it. And

104
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,339
he pressed me again to throw it away."

105
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,789
"Likely," said Herbert, with pretended horror.
"Why, we're going to be rich, and famous and

106
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,859
happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin
with; then you can't be henpecked."

107
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,419
He darted round the table, pursued by the
maligned Mrs. White armed with an antimacassar.

108
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,419
Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and
eyed it dubiously. "I don't know what to wish

109
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,429
for, and that's a fact," he said, slowly.
"It seems to me I've got all I want."

110
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,819
"If you only cleared the house, you'd be quite
happy, wouldn't you?" said Herbert, with his

111
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,599
hand on his shoulder. "Well, wish for two
hundred pounds, then; that 'll just do it."

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,089
His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own
credulity, held up the talisman, as his son,

113
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,679
with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink
at his mother, sat down at the piano and struck

114
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,109
a few impressive chords.

115
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,579
"I wish for two hundred pounds," said the
old man distinctly.

116
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,929
A fine crash from the piano greeted the words,
interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old

117
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,269
man. His wife and son ran toward him.

118
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,959
"It moved," he cried, with a glance of disgust
at the object as it lay on the floor.

119
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,649
"As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a
snake."

120
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,779
"Well, I don't see the money," said his son
as he picked it up and placed it on the table,

121
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,969
"and I bet I never shall."

122
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,419
"It must have been your fancy, father," said
his wife, regarding him anxiously.

123
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,209
He shook his head. "Never mind, though; there's
no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the

124
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,209
same."

125
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,879
They sat down by the fire again while the
two men finished their pipes. Outside, the

126
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,009
wind was higher than ever, and the old man
started nervously at the sound of a door banging

127
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:39,499
upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing
settled upon all three, which lasted until

128
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,029
the old couple rose to retire for the night.

129
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,799
"I expect you'll find the cash tied up in
a big bag in the middle of your bed," said

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,599
Herbert, as he bade them good-night, "and
something horrible squatting up on top of

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,289
the wardrobe watching you as you pocket your
ill-gotten gains."

132
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,029
He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the
dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last

133
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,209
face was so horrible and so simian that he
gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid

134
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,559
that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt
on the table for a glass containing a little

135
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,599
water to throw over it. His hand grasped the
monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he

136
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,399
wiped his hand on his coat and went up to
bed.

137
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,399
II.

138
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,669
In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning
as it streamed over the breakfast table he

139
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,219
laughed at his fears. There was an air of
prosaic wholesomeness about the room which

140
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,299
it had lacked on the previous night, and the
dirty, shrivelled little paw was pitched on

141
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,369
the sideboard with a carelessness which betokened
no great belief in its virtues.

142
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,319
"I suppose all old soldiers are the same,"
said Mrs. White. "The idea of our listening

143
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,019
to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted
in these days? And if they could, how could

144
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,959
two hundred pounds hurt you, father?"

145
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,869
"Might drop on his head from the sky," said
the frivolous Herbert.

146
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,420
"Morris said the things happened so naturally,"
said his father, "that you might if you so

147
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,189
wished attribute it to coincidence."

148
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,289
"Well, don't break into the money before I
come back," said Herbert as he rose from the

149
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,489
table. "I'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean,
avaricious man, and we shall have to disown

150
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,489
you."

151
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,419
His mother laughed, and following him to the
door, watched him down the road; and returning

152
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,710
to the breakfast table, was very happy at
the expense of her husband's credulity. All

153
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:16,850
of which did not prevent her from scurrying
to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent

154
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:21,209
her from referring somewhat shortly to retired
sergeant-majors of bibulous habits when she

155
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,879
found that the post brought a tailor's bill.

156
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,809
"Herbert will have some more of his funny
remarks, I expect, when he comes home," she

157
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,379
said, as they sat at dinner.

158
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,310
"I dare say," said Mr. White, pouring himself
out some beer; "but for all that, the thing

159
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:36,679
moved in my hand; that I'll swear to."

160
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,739
"You thought it did," said the old lady soothingly.

161
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,969
"I say it did," replied the other. "There
was no thought about it; I had just—- What's

162
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,269
the matter?"

163
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,059
His wife made no reply. She was watching the
mysterious movements of a man outside, who,

164
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,429
peering in an undecided fashion at the house,
appeared to be trying to make up his mind

165
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,559
to enter. In mental connection with the two
hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger

166
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,299
was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy
newness. Three times he paused at the gate,

167
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,189
and then walked on again. The fourth time
he stood with his hand upon it, and then with

168
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,079
sudden resolution flung it open and walked
up the path. Mrs. White at the same moment

169
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,529
placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly
unfastening the strings of her apron, put

170
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,839
that useful article of apparel beneath the
cushion of her chair.

171
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,459
She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at
ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively,

172
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,659
and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the
old lady apologized for the appearance of

173
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,289
the room, and her husband's coat, a garment
which he usually reserved for the garden.

174
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,609
She then waited as patiently as her sex would
permit, for him to broach his business, but

175
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,129
he was at first strangely silent.

176
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,829
"I—was asked to call," he said at last,
and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from

177
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,429
his trousers. "I come from 'Maw and Meggins.'"

178
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,699
The old lady started. "Is anything the matter?"
she asked, breathlessly. "Has anything happened

179
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,439
to Herbert? What is it? What is it?"

180
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,709
Her husband interposed. "There, there, mother,"
he said, hastily. "Sit down, and don't jump

181
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,459
to conclusions. You've not brought bad news,
I'm sure, sir;" and he eyed the other wistfully.

182
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,459
"I'm sorry—" began the visitor.

183
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,209
"Is he hurt?" demanded the mother, wildly.

184
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:17,639
The visitor bowed in assent. "Badly hurt,"
he said, quietly, "but he is not in any pain."

185
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,669
"Oh, thank God!" said the old woman, clasping
her hands. "Thank God for that! Thank—"

186
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,669
She broke off suddenly as the sinister meaning
of the assurance dawned upon her and she saw

187
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,859
the awful confirmation of her fears in the
other's averted face. She caught her breath,

188
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,150
and turning to her slower-witted husband,
laid her trembling old hand upon his. There

189
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:38,579
was a long silence.

190
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,429
"He was caught in the machinery," said the
visitor at length in a low voice.

191
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,699
"Caught in the machinery," repeated Mr. White,
in a dazed fashion, "yes."

192
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,789
He sat staring blankly out at the window,
and taking his wife's hand between his own,

193
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,939
pressed it as he had been wont to do in their
old courting-days nearly forty years before.

194
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:06,109
"He was the only one left to us," he said,
turning gently to the visitor. "It is hard."

195
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,149
The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly
to the window. "The firm wished me to convey

196
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,239
their sincere sympathy with you in your great
loss," he said, without looking round. "I

197
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,009
beg that you will understand I am only their
servant and merely obeying orders."

198
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,689
There was no reply; the old woman's face was
white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible;

199
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,659
on the husband's face was a look such as his
friend the sergeant might have carried into

200
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,789
his first action.

201
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,069
"I was to say that 'Maw and Meggins' disclaim
all responsibility," continued the other.

202
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:42,819
"They admit no liability at all, but in consideration
of your son's services, they wish to present

203
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,399
you with a certain sum as compensation."

204
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,539
Mr. White dropped his wife's hand, and rising
to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at

205
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,599
his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words,
"How much?"

206
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,889
"Two hundred pounds," was the answer.

207
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,289
Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old
man smiled faintly, put out his hands like

208
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,829
a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless
heap, to the floor.

209
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,179
III.

210
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,549
In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant,
the old people buried their dead, and came

211
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,589
back to a house steeped in shadow and silence.
It was all over so quickly that at first they

212
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,129
could hardly realize it, and remained in a
state of expectation as though of something

213
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,149
else to happen —something else which was
to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts

214
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,249
to bear.

215
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,779
But the days passed, and expectation gave
place to resignation—the hopeless resignation

216
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,359
of the old, sometimes miscalled, apathy. Sometimes
they hardly exchanged a word, for now they

217
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,659
had nothing to talk about, and their days
were long to weariness.

218
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,189
It was about a week after that the old man,
waking suddenly in the night, stretched out

219
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,039
his hand and found himself alone. The room
was in darkness, and the sound of subdued

220
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,009
weeping came from the window. He raised himself
in bed and listened.

221
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,369
"Come back," he said, tenderly. "You will
be cold."

222
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,559
"It is colder for my son," said the old woman,
and wept afresh.

223
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,459
The sound of her sobs died away on his ears.
The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with

224
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,739
sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until
a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him

225
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,789
with a start.

226
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,449
"The paw!" she cried wildly. "The monkey's
paw!"

227
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,469
He started up in alarm. "Where? Where is it?
What's the matter?"

228
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,349
She came stumbling across the room toward
him. "I want it," she said, quietly. "You've

229
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,349
not destroyed it?"

230
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,399
"It's in the parlour, on the bracket," he
replied, marvelling. "Why?"

231
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,119
She cried and laughed together, and bending
over, kissed his cheek.

232
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,579
"I only just thought of it," she said, hysterically.
"Why didn't I think of it before? Why didn't

233
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,579
you think of it?"

234
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,079
"Think of what?" he questioned.

235
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,509
"The other two wishes," she replied, rapidly.
"We've only had one."

236
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,579
"Was not that enough?" he demanded, fiercely.

237
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,649
"No," she cried, triumphantly; "we'll have
one more. Go down and get it quickly, and

238
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,299
wish our boy alive again."

239
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,779
The man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes
from his quaking limbs. "Good God, you are

240
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,039
mad!" he cried, aghast.

241
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,929
"Get it," she panted; "get it quickly, and
wish—Oh, my boy, my boy!"

242
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,149
Her husband struck a match and lit the candle.
"Get back to bed," he said, unsteadily. "You

243
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,159
don't know what you are saying."

244
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,299
"We had the first wish granted," said the
old woman, feverishly; "why not the second?"

245
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,539
"A coincidence," stammered the old man.

246
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,259
"Go and get it and wish," cried his wife,
quivering with excitement.

247
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,759
The old man turned and regarded her, and his
voice shook. "He has been dead ten days, and

248
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,289
besides he—I would not tell you else, but—I
could only recognize him by his clothing.

249
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,049
If he was too terrible for you to see then,
how now?"

250
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,049
"Bring him back," cried the old woman, and
dragged him toward the door. "Do you think

251
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,389
I fear the child I have nursed?"

252
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,879
He went down in the darkness, and felt his
way to the parlour, and then to the mantelpiece.

253
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,489
The talisman was in its place, and a horrible
fear that the unspoken wish might bring his

254
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,509
mutilated son before him ere he could escape
from the room seized upon him, and he caught

255
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,209
his breath as he found that he had lost the
direction of the door. His brow cold with

256
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,659
sweat, he felt his way round the table, and
groped along the wall until he found himself

257
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,399
in the small passage with the unwholesome
thing in his hand.

258
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,169
Even his wife's face seemed changed as he
entered the room. It was white and expectant,

259
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,349
and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural
look upon it. He was afraid of her.

260
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,648
"Wish!" she cried, in a strong voice.

261
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,659
"It is foolish and wicked," he faltered.

262
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,809
"Wish!" repeated his wife.

263
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,329
He raised his hand. "I wish my son alive again."

264
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,109
The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded
it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into

265
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,669
a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes,
walked to the window and raised the blind.

266
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,009
He sat until he was chilled with the cold,
glancing occasionally at the figure of the

267
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,439
old woman peering through the window. The
candle-end, which had burned below the rim

268
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,940
of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating
shadows on the ceiling and walls, until, with

269
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:59,209
a flicker larger than the rest, it expired.
The old man, with an unspeakable sense of

270
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,118
relief at the failure of the talisman, crept
back to his bed, and a minute or two afterward

271
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,509
the old woman came silently and apathetically
beside him.

272
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:13,308
Neither spoke, but lay silently listening
to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked,

273
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:18,618
and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through
the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and

274
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:23,729
after lying for some time screwing up his
courage, he took the box of matches, and striking

275
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,789
one, went downstairs for a candle.

276
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,259
At the foot of the stairs the match went out,
and he paused to strike another; and at the

277
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:36,669
same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy
as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the

278
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,029
front door.

279
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,119
The matches fell from his hand and spilled
in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath

280
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,719
suspended until the knock was repeated. Then
he turned and fled swiftly back to his room,

281
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,689
and closed the door behind him. A third knock
sounded through the house.

282
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,249
"What's that?" cried the old woman, starting
up.

283
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,599
"A rat," said the old man in shaking tones—"a
rat. It passed me on the stairs."

284
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,739
His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock
resounded through the house.

285
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,919
"It's Herbert!" she screamed. "It's Herbert!"

286
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,889
She ran to the door, but her husband was before
her, and catching her by the arm, held her

287
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,889
tightly.

288
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,619
"What are you going to do?" he whispered hoarsely.

289
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,169
"It's my boy; it's Herbert!" she cried, struggling
mechanically. "I forgot it was two miles away.

290
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,259
What are you holding me for? Let go. I must
open the door."

291
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,359
"For God's sake don't let it in," cried the
old man, trembling.

292
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,029
"You're afraid of your own son," she cried,
struggling. "Let me go. I'm coming, Herbert;

293
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,029
I'm coming."

294
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,869
There was another knock, and another. The
old woman with a sudden wrench broke free

295
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,219
and ran from the room. Her husband followed
to the landing, and called after her appealingly

296
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,399
as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain
rattle back and the bottom bolt drawn slowly

297
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,529
and stiffly from the socket. Then the old
woman's voice, strained and panting.

298
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,939
"The bolt," she cried, loudly. "Come down.
I can't reach it."

299
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,779
But her husband was on his hands and knees
groping wildly on the floor in search of the

300
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,558
paw. If he could only find it before the thing
outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks

301
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,779
reverberated through the house, and he heard
the scraping of a chair as his wife put it

302
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,899
down in the passage against the door. He heard
the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly

303
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,439
back, and at the same moment he found the
monkey's paw, and frantically breathed his

304
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,439
third and last wish.

305
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,709
The knocking ceased, although the echoes of
it were still in the house. He heard the chair

306
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:18,979
drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind
rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail

307
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,909
of disappointment and misery from his wife
gave him courage to run down to her side,

308
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:28,489
and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp
flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted

309
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:28,491
road.
