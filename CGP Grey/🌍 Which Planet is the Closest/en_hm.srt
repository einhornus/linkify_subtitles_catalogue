00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,139
My Very Easy Method Just Speeds Up Naming… Planets.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,059
Every Physics classroom has a Solar System line like this.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,319
Or… like this.  (Sorry, Pluto.)

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,819
Looking at the line, which planet is closest to Earth: Venus or Mars?

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,679
To answer, you need first know that, like many things in school, the line is a lie.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,659
Planets are not people queuing for coffee, but rather spheroids scattered in space,

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,279
always in motion, not in simple circles either, but in ellipses at untidy angles.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,959
In the cold, dark expanse, this is the coziest Venus gets to Earth,

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,679
but only about once a year and a half-ish.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,439
Starting close, she orbits far, then comes back, needs some space -- on the other side of the sun.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,159
This means when Venus is away, Mars can be the closest to play.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,959
So because of orbits, there isn’t one answer to, “Who is the closest?”

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,119
It's really, “Who is mostly the closest?”

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,479
The mostest closest.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,199
When Mars and Venus are both on the other side of the Sun, it leaves little Mercury the closest.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,879
Each of Earth’s inner three planet friends are at one time the farthest and the closest.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,599
And Mercury, with his smallest orbit, makes him never that far from Earth.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,439
At least on planetary scales.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,319
Giving the little guy a uniquely close relationship with Terra.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:20,439
In fact, watching the planets spin, because of his small orbit, Mercury, not Mars or Venus, is the closest planet most of the time.

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,519
Looking at the line, that seems unpossible.

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,079
But nonetheless, in the way of actual orbits,

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,919
if we keep measuring the distance to all the planets as they spin,

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,919
Mercury is Earth's mostest closest neighbor.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,879
Which is delightfully unexpected.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,719
But wait, if Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth, he has to be the mostest closest to Venus as well, right?

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,959
Because her orbit is smaller than Earth's.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,839
And running the numbers, it's true.

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,319
Making Earth's special relationship with Mercury less special.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,159
But at least this is one time where the line provides the obvious answer.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,079
Mercury is closest to Venus.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,799
While we’re here, who is Mars’s mostest closest?

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,839
On his other side is the asteroid belt, so it should be Earth.

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,359
But, maybe it's Venus?

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,199
Maybe the rule is the second closest is the mostest closest.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,999
Watching the results, aaaand…

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
Oh my Celestia, it's Mercury again.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,079
Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth, Venus, and Mars, for the same reason each time.

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,879
Bigger orbits make farther average distances for longer times.

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,719
So, mercurial Mercury is the constant-est companion.

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,839
No, no.  It can't be true for Jupiter too.

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,919
Enormous, far away Jupiter.

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,719
But, it is!

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,719
Once again, Mercury’s small orbit means he never goes as far away as the other planets with their bigger orbits.

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,519
Thus, are you ready for this?

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:45,639
The orbital math that shows Mercury is the mostest closest to Jupiter is the same for all the planets and everything that orbits the sun.

47
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,359
(You too, Pluto.)
[high-five]

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,439
For each of the planets, Mercury is the mostest closest.

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:14,480
