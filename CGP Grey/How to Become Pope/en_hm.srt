1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,859
Let’s say you want to become pope, head
of the Catholic Church and shepherd to over

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,949
1 billion faithful.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,059
What requirements must you have for this lofty
position:

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,399
1) Be a catholic and

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,719
2) Be a man.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,209
Which seems a little thin… and, while it’s
technically possible for a regular Sunday

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,418
Catholic to become pope, the last time this
happened was essentially never because becoming

8
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:21,239
pope isn’t like becoming president, you
can’t just run for office.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,788
Selecting the pope is an inside job and the
men who do it are the cardinals, and while

10
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:28,828
in theory they can select any catholic man
to become pope, in practice they prefer to

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,059
elevate one of their own.

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,718
The last time a non-cardinal become pope was
more than 600 years ago.

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,828
So, while it isn’t an official requirement,
it’s an unofficial, official requirement.

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,069
Thus in order to be pope you’ll first need
to be a cardinal and to do that you’ll need

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,518
to start climbing the catholic corporate ladder.*

16
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,099
Step 1: Become a Priest.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,669
Unlike some churches where you can fill out
a form online and – poof – ordained.

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,948
The Catholic Church treats becoming a priest
as a real, you-need-training profession.

19
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:56,378
So you’re going to require a lot of education:
usually a college degree in Catholic Philosophy

20
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,129
and then a masters in divinity.

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,698
In addition to your educational qualifications,
you must also be:

22
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:02,159
A man
Unmarried,

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,908
Willing to remain celibate forever.†
If you meet these requirements, and have been

24
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,809
working with the church, then you can be officially
ordained as a priest.

25
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,919
Which basically means you get to run a Catholic
Church, or work with another priest who does.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,999
But, you want onward and to do that you need
to take the job of the man who just made you

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,999
a priest.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,950
Step 2: Become a Bishop
Bishops are a much more select group: while

29
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:24,618
there are about 400,000 catholic priests world
wide, there are only about 5,000 bishops.

30
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:28,868
While priests get churches, bishops get cathedrals,
from which they oversee a number of local

31
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:29,868
churches.

32
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,129
To advance your career you must wait for a
bishop in your area to be forced into retirement

33
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,560
at age 75 or die sooner than that – freeing
up space for you.

34
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,978
But you can’t just apply, because there’s
already a secret list of potential bishops

35
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,129
that’s updated every three years based on
who the current bishops in your area think

36
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,399
would make a good replacement for one of their
own.

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,809
To be on that list, in addition to the obvious
requirement of being a pious person, you should

38
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,809
also:

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,499
Be least 35 years old
Have been priest for at least five years

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,119
Have a doctorate in theology (or equivalent)
Assuming you’re all these things, your name

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,038
may, or may not be on the secret list.

42
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,339
The local bishops then give that list to the
pope’s ambassador for your country, known

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,929
as the Apostolic Nuncio.

44
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,499
The Nuncio picks three priests from the list,
does in-depth research on them, conducts interviews

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,839
and selects the one he thinks is best.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,479
But it’s not over, because the Nuncio sends
his report to Vatican City and the congress

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,649
of bishops who work there reviewing potential
appointments from around the world.

48
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,378
If the congress of bishops doesn’t like
any of the three candidates, they can tell

49
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:21,619
the Nuncio to start over: returning to the
list, picking another three candidates – doing

50
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,789
more research, more interviews and sending
off the results.

51
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,759
When the congress of bishops is happy with
one of the Nuncio’s candidates that name

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,249
is given to the pope, who can reject the candidate
and start the whole process over.

53
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,729
It shouldn’t be a surprise that from a vacancy
to a bishop’s replacement can take months

54
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,509
and, on occasion, years.

55
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,289
But assuming that a bishop in your area retired
(or died) at the right time and you were on

56
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,609
the secret list of good priests and the Nuncio
picked you and you made it through his interview

57
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,089
and the congress of bishops approved you and
the pope didn’t veto you – poof now you’re

58
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,089
now a bishop.

59
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,089
But you’re still not on top.

60
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,129
The penultimate promotion is…

61
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,799
Step 3: Become a Cardinal.

62
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,268
Despite the fancy name and snazzy red outfits
to match cardinals are not the bosses of bishops,

63
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,768
they are bishops, just with an additional
title and additional responsibilities – the

64
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:02,229
most notable of which is electing the new
pope.‡

65
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,908
The only way to become a cardinal is to get
to current pope to appoint you as one – and

66
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,759
of the 5,000 bishops, only about 200 are ever
cardinals.

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,709
But let’s say your ambition doesn’t go
unnoticed by the pope and he makes you a cardinal

68
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,568
– now it’s time to play the waiting game
for his death or retirement – and with popes

69
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,339
death is vastly more likely.

70
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,568
When either happens the cardinals under the
age of 80 are brought to Vatican City where

71
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,529
they are isolated from the outside world – presumably
by taking away their cell phones and tablets

72
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,829
and carrier pigeons.

73
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,289
Once sequestered, the election of a new pope
can begin.

74
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,679
These elections are never exactly the same
because the ex-pope leaves instructions on

75
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,938
how he wants his replacement to be picked,
but in general it works like this: four times

76
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,878
a day the cardinals go to the Sistine Chapel
to vote – to become pope one of them must

77
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,188
get a 2/3rds majority.

78
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:46,869
There’s a big dose of musent-be-too-hasty
here as the cardinals don’t just raise their

79
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,259
hands, or use a modern preferential voting
system, but instead write down one name on

80
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,318
a piece of paper stand before the alter and
say a long latin phrase, before officially

81
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,669
casting the ballot.

82
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,859
Once all the cardinals have done this, the
votes are counted and then burned.

83
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,708
This why TV news stations covering the election
of the pope use super-modern-hd-livestreaming

84
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,179
cameras to look at a chimney.

85
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,298
If the smoke is black, no new pope.

86
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,169
The high victory threshold, and tediously
slow voting process, is why it takes so long

87
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,318
to elect a new pope.

88
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,759
It’s usually at least two weeks of voting
four times a day six days a week (with one

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,629
day a week for prayer) but the record length
is three years.

90
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,719
Assuming you, eventually, win the support
of your fellow cardinals, you have one final

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,479
thing to do before becoming pope: pick yourself
a new name.

92
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,849
There is no formal rule, you can name yourself
anything you like but it’s tradition to

93
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,469
take the name of a previous pope.

94
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,009
Upon your acceptance of the job, the final
ballots are burned clean to make the smoke

95
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,009
white and announce to the world that a new
pope has been selected.

96
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,759
So that’s the career path: be born into
the right half of the population, become one

97
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,509
of a billion catholics, then one of 400,000
priests, then one of 5,000 bishops, then one

98
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,559
of 200 cardinals, wait for the current pope
to die or retire, and convince 2/3rds of your

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,050
fellow cardinals to select you as the one,
the only pope.
