1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,559
Military bases and embassies, contrary to popular opinion,  don't count as American soil;

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,759
though, they're close.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,719
The country hosting the base agrees that her laws don't apply within the base, but the base is still on her land.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,039
That she owns.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,279
Because it's hers.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,719
In her country.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,779
This is called extraterritoriality, 
and it isn't unique to the United States,
but it's notable with her because of its frequency,

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,799
and in one case,
(Guantanamo Bay, Cuba), contention.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,259
The short version of this story is:

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,079
Cuba used to be a U.S. territory,

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,139
(taken after the Spanish-American War
 with Puerto Rico, and Guam, and Spain's pride).

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,299
Cuba eventually went her own way,
but the U.S. naval base, in Guantanamo Bay,

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,759
stayed where it was and the U.S. payed to rent the land.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,659
But then, revoluciÃ³n, and
disagreement between Cuba and the U.S. over the rent,

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,759
leading to the current awkward situation:

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,679
where the U.S. says to Cuba,
"Thank you for renting us this land!"

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,079
and Cuba says,
"We didn't rent you that land."

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,059
and the U.S. says,
"Here's our rent payment!"

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,359
and Cuba says,
"We don't accept that. Please leave?"

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,960
and the U.S. says,
"Thank you for renting us this land!"
