1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,459
Welcome to the United Kingdom
(and a Whole Lot More)
explained by me, C. G. P. Grey.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,959
United Kingdom?
England?
Great Britain?

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,899
Are these three the same place?
Are they different places?

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,199
Do British people secretly laugh those
who use the terms incorrectly?
Who knows the answers to these questions?

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,139
I do, and I'm going to tell you right now.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,479
For the lost — this is the world, this is the European continent, and this is the place we have to untangle.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,299
The area shown in purple is the United Kingdom.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,779
Part of the confusion is that the United Kingdom is not a single country, but is instead is a country of countries.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,019
It contains, inside of it —
four, co-equal, and sovereign nations.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,779
The first of these is England, shown here in red.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,739
England is often confused with the United Kingdom,
as a whole, because it's the largest and

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,009
most populous of the nations,
and contains the de facto capital city, London.

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,989
To the north is Scotland, shown in blue,
and to the west is Wales, shown in white,

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,919
and — often forgotten even
by those who live in the United Kingdom —
is Northern Ireland, shown in orange.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,809
Each country has a local term for the population.

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,799
While you can call them all 'British,'
it's not recommended;
as the four countries generally don't like each other.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,299
The Northern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh
regard the English as slave-driving, colonial masters

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,359
(no matter that all three have their own, devolved, Parliaments; and are allowed to vote on English laws despite the reverse not being true),

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,179
and the English generally regard the rest as rural, yokels who spend too much time with their sheep.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,839
However, as the four constituent countries
don't have their own passports,

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,399
they're all British citizens, like it or not.
They are British citizens of the United Kingdom,

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,959
whose full name, by the way, is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,979
So where's Great Britain hiding?

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,179
Right here, the area covered in black is Great Britain.

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,479
Unlike England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Great Britain is a geographical —
rather than a political — term.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,919
Great Britain is the largest island
among the British Isles.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,919
Within the United Kingdom,
the term 'Great Britain' is often used to refer to —
England, Scotland, and Wales alone

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,979
— with the intentional exclusion of Northern Ireland.

29
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,739
This is mostly, but not completely, true, as all three constituent countries have islands
that are not part of Great Britain:

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,999
such as the Isle of Wight (part of England),
the Welsh Isle of Anglesey,

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,519
the Scottish Hebrides, the Shetland Islands,
the Orkney Islands, and the Islands of the Clyde.

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,608
The second biggest island in the British Isles is Ireland.

33
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,779
It's worth noting, at this point,
that Ireland is not a country;

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,459
like Great Britain,
it's a geographical — not political — term.

35
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,499
The Island of Ireland contains, on it, two countries:

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,459
Northern Ireland, which we have already discussed,
and the Republic of Ireland.

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,979
When people say they are 'Irish,'
they're referring to the Republic of Ireland

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,868
(which is a separate country from the United Kingdom).

39
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,559
However, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union —

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,719
even though England, in particular, likes to
pretend that it's an island in the mid-Atlantic,

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,499
rather than 50 kilometers off the coast of France —
but that's a story for another time.

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,179
To review:

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,019
the two largest islands in the British Isles
are Ireland and Great Britain.

44
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,899
Ireland has, on it, two countries —
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland;

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,779
while Great Britain, mostly, contains three:
England, Scotland and Wales.

46
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,859
These last three, when combined with Northern Ireland, form the United Kingdom.

47
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,739
There are still many unanswered questions:
such as, why, when you travel to Canada,

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,319
is there British royalty on the money?

49
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,319
To answer this, we need to talk about empire.

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,399
You can't have gone to school, in the English-speaking world, without having learned that the British Empire

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,439
once spanned 1/4th the world's land
and governed nearly 1/4th the world's people.

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,199
While it's easy to remember the parts of the
British Empire that broke away violently,

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,579
we often forget how many nations gained independence through diplomacy, not bloodshed.

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,779
These want-to-be nations struck a deal with the Empire: where they continued to recognize the Monarchy

55
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,479
as the Head of State, in exchange
for a local, autonomous parliament.

56
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,768
To understand how they are connected,
we need to talk about the Crown.

57
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,548
Not the physical crown — that sits behind glass in the Tower of London, and earns millions

58
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:50,208
of tourist pounds for the UK — but the Crown as a complicated, legal entity,

59
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,048
best thought of as a one-man corporation.

60
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,328
Who created this corporation?

61
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,128
God did.

62
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:58,208
According to British tradition, all power is vested in God and the Monarch is crowned in a Christian ceremony.

63
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,479
God, however, not wanting to be bothered with micromanagement,

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
conveniently delegates his power his power to an entity called the Crown.

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,259
While this used to be the physical
crown in the Tower of London, it evolved,

66
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,519
over time, into a legal corporation; sole able to be controlled only by the ruling monarch.

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,919
It's a useful reminder that the United Kingdom is still, technically, a theocracy: with the reigning monarch

68
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,019
acting as both the Head of State and the Supreme Governor of the official state religion: Anglicanism.

69
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,259
Such are the oddities that arise when dealing with a thousand year-old Monarchy.

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,339
Back to Canada and the rest.

71
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,479
The former colonies that gained their independence through diplomacy, and continue to recognize
the authority of the Crown,

72
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,899
are known as the Commonwealth Realm.
They are, in decreasing order of population:

73
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,279
Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Jamaica, the Solomon Islands, Belize,

74
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,899
the Bahamas, Barbados, Saint Lucia, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada,

75
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,339
Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Tuvalu.

76
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,099
All are independent nations, but still recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State

77
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,379
(even though it has little
 real power within their borders).

78
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,759
There are three further entities that belong to the Crown, and these are the Crown Dependencies:
the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey.

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,879
Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they are not considered independent nations, but are granted

80
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,039
local autonomy by the Crown, and a British Citizenship by the United Kingdom

81
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,279
(though, the UK does reserve the right to over-rule 
the laws of their local assemblies).

82
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,599
Are we all done 𝘯𝘰𝘸?
Almost, but not quite;

83
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,919
there are still a couple of loose threads,
such as this place:

84
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,339
the tiny city of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain.

85
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,859
Famous for its rock, 
its monkeys, and for causing diplomatic
tension between the United Kingdom and Spain.

86
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,899
But what about the Falkland Islands:
which caused so much tension

87
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,819
between the United Kingdom and Argentina, that they went to war over them.

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,578
These places belong in the last group of Crown properties known as: British Overseas Territories,

89
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,338
but their former name,
'Crown Colonies,' gives away their origin.

90
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,119
They are the last vestiges of the British Empire.
Unlike the Commonwealth Realm,

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,299
they have not become independent nations and continue to rely on the United Kingdom

92
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,419
for military and, sometimes, economic assistance.

93
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,699
Like the Crown Dependencies, everyone born within their borders is a British citizen.

94
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,739
The Crown Colonies are,
in decreasing order of population:

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,459
Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands, 
Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Anguilla,

96
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,939
Saint Helena, the Ascension Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Montserrat, the British Indian Ocean Territory,
the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands,

97
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,199
the Falkland Islands, the British Antarctic Territory,
and the Pitcairn Islands.

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,199
For our final Venn diagram:

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,639
the United Kingdom is a country situated
on the British Isles and is part of the Crown,
which is controlled by the Monarchy.

100
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,299
Also part of the Crown and the British Isles are the Crown Dependencies.

101
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,919
The independent nations of the former Empire that still recognize the Crown are the Commonwealth Realm,

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,159
and the non-independent remnants of the former Empire and are the British Overseas Territories.

103
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,120
Thank you very much for watching!
