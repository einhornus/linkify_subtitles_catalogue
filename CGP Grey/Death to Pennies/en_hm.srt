1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,949
The story of the penny starts in the first
US Mint founded in 1792 which produced these

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,819
one-cent pieces along with other coins including
the Quarter, Dime, Half Dime and a mystery

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,599
coin that we'll get back to later.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,909
These pennies of the new republic were born
of 100% pure copper.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,229
But, two forces conspired to ensure this wouldn't
remain the case for long. The value of copper

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,889
went up and, because of inflation, the buying
power of the penny went down.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,009
This caused The Mint to reduce the amount
of copper in pennies, first from 100% to 95%,

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,018
and then to only 5% copper and 95% zinc.

9
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,189
Despite this debasement, in 2006 the value
of the metal in older pennies rose over 1

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,569
cent and suddenly they were worth more dead
than alive so people melted them to sell the

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,779
raw copper for profit.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,279
In a rational, efficient world, the story
of the penny would have ended here with the

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,678
Government realizing that they weren't worth
Minting and happy that its citizens were removing

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,678
them from circulation.

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,908
But, instead the Government made melting U.
S. coins illegal and continues to manufacture

16
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:52,389
4 million pennies each year.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,109
Which is idiotic as it costs the US Mint about
1.8 cents to make a each 1 cent penny.

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,939
But, even if pennies were minted from something
more representative of their true value -- like

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,128
plastic or lint -- it wouldn't fix the fundamental
problem that pennies are bad for people and

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,129
the economy.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,129
Here's why:

22
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,449
The purpose of physical, cash money is to
make it easy to transact the everyday business

23
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,449
of buying stuff.

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,728
A shopkeeper has stuff and you want that stuff.
Rather than bartering like savages for it,

25
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,679
you use cash as a medium of exchange.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,919
To get the price just right the cash must
be divisible into pieces so that you don't

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,919
overpay.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,218
But it isn't divided forever, because at some
point the value it represents is too small

29
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,259
to buy anything or bother with. Which brings
us back to the penny.

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,408
In the olden days, pennies could actually
buy stuff, no more. Now, if you want to spend

31
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,559
pennies, you're going to have to put in some
effort.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,908
For example, try to pay for 20 bucks worth
of groceries with 2,000 pennies weighing 11

33
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,599
pounds and see how that works out.

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,209
So you have to get rid of them by using exact
change.

35
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,118
But, because the United States doesn't include
sales tax in prices -- unlike more civilized

36
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,089
countries -- and you can't multiply by 8.875%
in your head, you can't get your change ready

37
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,879
before you reach the register like a good
Samaritan would.

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,389
The pennies you inevitably fiddle with after
discovering the true cost of your goods add

39
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,339
two seconds to each cash transaction on average
which is less than the value of your time,

40
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,039
and the time of everyone behind you, which
is why most normal people don't bother messing

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,948
with change and the usual penny-counting culprits
are those with nothing better to occupy their

42
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,948
day.

43
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,039
If you want to spend pennies without being
an inconsiderate jerk who wastes other peoples'

44
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,848
time perhaps you can find a machine that will
accept them.

45
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,749
Good luck with that. Vending machines won't
take pennies, neither laundry machines or

46
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,458
toll booths or parking meters or anything
else -- because pennies aren't worth the time

47
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,689
and effort to count, store and transport them.

48
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,848
In fact there is only one machine that takes
pennies: Coinstar -- a leach on the economy

49
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:35,318
that eats 10% of your money while providing
nothing in return except the ability to spend

50
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,889
cash that was already yours.

51
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,179
The difficulty of spending pennies is why
they end up in jars, dead to the economy after

52
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,119
a short, useless life where they failed at
their only job, to facilitate exchange and

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,798
instead did the exact opposite by being a
literal dead weight on every cash transaction.

54
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:50,939
They must be eliminated.

55
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,878
But, you might think, won't prices rise and
charities lose money without the penny?

56
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,878
No.

57
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,379
New Zealand got rid of their 1 cent coin,
as did Oz. Finland and the Netherlands ditched

58
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,889
the 1 euro cent coin as well. Though that
might have been because of how absurdly small

59
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,249
and frustrating 1 euro cent is.

60
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,639
These countries round to the nearest 5 cents
for cash transactions and none of them saw

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,089
prices rise or charitable donations drop.

62
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,339
And anyway, the United States has already
gone through this process before without trouble.

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,159
Remember the mystery coin from the beginning?
That was the half-cent. Seen one lately? Of

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,589
course you haven't. It was discontinued in
1857 for being worth too little.

65
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,298
But when the half-cent met its fate, it had
more buying power than today's dime so perhaps

66
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:31,408
the list of modern coins to kill could even
be larger.

67
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,579
There is one last, irrational problem with
getting rid of the penny.

68
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,809
Everybody loves Lincoln -- well almost everyone.
After booting off Lady Liberty and the Chief,

69
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,299
the US sure has Lincoln-ified the penny within
an inch of its life.

70
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,259
But ditching the penny won't erase him from
history.

71
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,899
Lincoln, and his monument, are still on the
5 dollar bill which isn't going away.

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,268
And, even if you think it's unpatriotic or
disrespectful to retire Presidential coinage,

73
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,899
allow me to direct you to a little organization
known as the United States Military.

74
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,779
Where, in overseas bases, they've already
abolished the penny by automatically rounding

75
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,359
to the nearest five cents.

76
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,279
Sooner or later even the most ardent Lincoln
lovers will have to give up the penny: they

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,029
cost more to make than they're worth, they
waste peoples' time, they don't work as money,

78
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,919
and because of inflation they're less valuable
every year making all the other problems worse.

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,250
Sorry Abe, but it's time to kill the penny.
