00:00:00,947 --> 00:00:04,915
There is no greater human joy than waking up to a winter wonderland

2
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:08,263
that with its frosty magic also cancelled school.

3
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:09,703
Well, no more.

4
00:00:09,704 --> 00:00:12,343
Because schools are cancelling snow days.

5
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:17,482
Some school systems have decided

6
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,026
This way when there's too much snow

7
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,731
to physically drag students in,

8
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,897
we can still mentally drag them in.

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:39,882
[Grey]
Wha..? Who di...? How...? What kind of villains are you?

10
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:43,032
[Grey]
Gah! We don't all agree. This is horrifying!

11
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,251
Internet, where are you?

12
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,032
Where's hashtag SaveSnowDays to protect us?

13
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,854
[Boring Bureaucrat]
Shhhh, we don't need that.

14
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:52,146
[Grey]
No! You can not take away the human experience of being

15
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:55,875
on a dark winter's night unable to face the next day.

16
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:59,931
Then when thin clouds appear on the horizon giving you faint hope.

17
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:04,485
You beg with all of your belief to make it happen.

18
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:09,857
And when it does happen, it is the most epic experience of low to high

19
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:13,537
combining the triple joys of snow and freedom and

20
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,869
gettingoutofsomethingthatyoutotallyshouldnthave.

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,977
There are only so many of days of such great glory in a human life.

22
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:25,106
But, say some school boards,

23
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:28,909
And I fear this snow day cancellation pestilation will spread

24
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,346
because the school system with its bureaucracies

25
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:34,029
and committees loves its checkboxes checked,

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,919
its percentages maxed, and its attendance punch cards punched.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,654
Snows days mess all that up.

28
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:40,725
So the system,

29
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,408
wielding the ultimate banality of evil,

30
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,959
cancels snow days.

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,522
Look, I'm just going to say it.

32
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:52,626
Yes, I am going to play the won't somebody please think of the children card.

33
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:55,205
[under his breath]
teenagers, I know you hate this, but its in your best interest to roll with it.

34
00:01:55,206 --> 00:02:00,823
But seriously, protecting snow days is what this card was made to play.

35
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:02,423
Those who want to cancel snow days

36
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:06,214
should be forced to look into the wide, excited eyes of a little girl,

37
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:09,819
waking up to experience her very first snow day and tell her,

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,091
[Boring Bureaucrat]
No! you can't play outside.

39
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:12,848
[Wide-eyed little Girl]
Why?

40
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,580
[Boring Bureaucrat]
Because it's super important that today,

41
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:16,454
right now,

42
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:19,777
you learn about what a newspaper frontage, in England,

43
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:22,023
three hundred years ago, thought was important

44
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:30,275
and you also must know the French conjugation of the verb "to have fun."

45
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,879
[Boring Bureaucrat]
This... this is what matters.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,869
[Grey]
If you can do that,

47
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,869
while thinking you are doing good,

48
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,854
you are a heartless monster extinguishing the light of a child.

49
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:43,771
A child who, while on their kiddie conference call,

50
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:48,503
with their ikkle headset, listening to a teacher tell them

51
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:53,568
will resolve the cognitive dissonance by deciding

52
00:02:53,569 --> 00:03:02,897
And with a sigh say,

53
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:05,494
No! This shall not pass.

54
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:07,106
Don't cancel snow days.

55
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:09,549
Cancel kill joy committees.
