1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,989
Every human used to have to hunt or gather to survive. But humans are smart...ly lazy so

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,679
we made tools to make our work easier. From sticks, to plows, to tractors we’ve gone

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,139
from everyone needing to make food to, modern agriculture with almost no one needing to

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,399
make food — and yet, we still have abundance.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,079
Of course, it’s not just farming, it’s
everything. We’ve spent the last several

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,579
thousand years building tools to reduce physical
labor of all kinds. These are mechanical muscles.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,139
Stronger, more reliable, and more tireless
than human muscles ever could be.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,659
And that's a good thing. Replacing human labor
with mechanical muscles frees people to specialize

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,369
and that leaves everyone better off - even those
still doing physical labor. This is how economies

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,609
grow and standards of living rise.

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,229
Some people have specialized to be programmers
and engineers whose job is to build mechanical

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,119
minds. Just as mechanical muscles made human
labor less in demand so are mechanical minds

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,099
making human brain labor less in demand.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,808
This is an economic revolution. You may think
we've been here before, but we haven't.

15
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,499
This time is different.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,129
## Physical Labor

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,619
When you think of automation, you probably
think of this: giant, custom-built, expensive,

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,449
efficient, but really dumb robots blind to
the world and their own work. They were a

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,449
scary kind of automation but they haven't
taken over the world because they're only

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,309
cost effective in narrow situations.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,288
But they're the old kind of automation, this
is the new kind.

22
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,319
Meet Baxter.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,199
Unlike these things which require skilled
operators and technicians and millions of dollars,

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,038
Baxter has vision and can learn what
you want him to do by watching you do it.

25
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:41,578
And he costs less than the average annual
salary of a human worker. Unlike his older

26
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,648
brothers he isn't pre-programmed for one specific
job, he can do whatever work is within the

27
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,398
reach of his arms. Baxter is what might be
thought of as a general purpose robot and

28
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,578
general purpose is a big deal.

29
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,848
Think computers, they too started out as highly
custom and highly expensive, but when cheap-ish

30
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:02,748
general-purpose computers appeared they quickly
became vital to everything.

31
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:07,428
A general-purpose computer can just as easily
calculate change or assign seats on an airplane

32
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:13,179
or play a game or do anything just by swapping
its software. And this huge demand for computers

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,169
of all kinds is what makes them both more
powerful and cheaper every year.

34
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,319
Baxter today is the computer of the 1980s.
He’s not the apex but the beginning. Even

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,959
if Baxter is slow his hourly cost is pennies
worth of electricity while his meat-based

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,899
competition costs minimum wage. A tenth the
speed is still cost effective when it's a

37
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,609
hundredth the price. And while Baxter isn't
as smart as some of the other things we will

38
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,599
talk about, he's smart enough to take over
many low-skill jobs.

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,289
And we've already seen how dumber robots than
Baxter can replace jobs. In new supermarkets

40
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,539
what used to be 30 humans is now one human
overseeing 30 cashier robots.

41
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,819
Or take the hundreds of thousand baristas employed
world-wide? There’s a barista robot coming

42
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,959
for them. Sure maybe your guy makes the double-mocha-whatever
just perfect and you’d never trust anyone

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,259
else -- but millions of people don’t care
and just want a decent cup of coffee. Oh, and

44
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,299
by the way this robot is actually a giant
network of robots that remembers who you are

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,039
and how you like your coffee no matter where
you are. Pretty convenient.

46
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,649
We think of technological change as the fancy
new expensive stuff, but the real change comes

47
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,359
from last decade's stuff getting cheaper and
faster. That's what's happening to robots

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,229
now. And because their mechanical minds are
capable of decision making they are out-competing

49
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,729
humans for jobs in a way no pure mechanical
muscle ever could.

50
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,669
## Luddite Horses

51
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,179
Imagine a pair of horses in the early 1900s
talking about technology. One worries all

52
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,169
these new mechanical muscles will make horses
unnecessary.

53
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,419
The other reminds him that everything so far
has made their lives easier -- remember all

54
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,209
that farm work? Remember running from coast-to-coast
delivering mail? Remember riding into battle?

55
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,929
All terrible. These city jobs are pretty cushy, and with so many humans in the cities there

56
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,399
will be more jobs for horses than ever.

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,199
Even if this car thingy takes off - he might say - there will be

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,679
new jobs for horses we can't imagine.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,239
But you, dear viewer, from beyond 2000 know
what happened -- there are still working horses,

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,649
but nothing like before. The horse population
peaked in 1915 -- from that point on it was

61
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,649
nothing but down.

62
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,898
There isn’t a rule of economics that says
better technology makes more better jobs

63
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:24,598
for horses. It sounds shockingly dumb to even
say that out loud, but swap horses for humans

64
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,388
and suddenly people think it sounds about
right.

65
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,459
As mechanical muscles pushed horses out of
the economy, mechanical minds will do the

66
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,098
same to humans. Not immediately, not everywhere,
but in large enough numbers and soon enough

67
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:42,098
that it's going to be a huge problem if we
are not prepared. And we are not prepared.

68
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:46,098
You, like the second horse, may look at the
state of technology now and think it can’t

69
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:50,309
possibly replace your job. But technology
gets better, cheaper, and faster at a rate

70
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,089
biology can’t match.

71
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,519
Just as the car was the beginning of the end
for the horse so now does the car show us

72
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,709
the shape of things to come.

73
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,998
## Automobiles

74
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:05,998
Self-driving cars aren't the future: they're
here and they work. Self-driving cars have

75
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:09,418
travelled hundreds of thousands of miles up
and down the California coast and through

76
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,198
cities -- all without human intervention.

77
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,869
The question is not if they'll replaces cars,
but how quickly. They don’t need to be perfect,

78
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,579
they just need to be better than us. Humans
drivers, by the way, kill 40,000 people a

79
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,978
year with cars just in the United States.
Given that self-driving cars don’t blink,

80
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,959
don’t text while driving, don’t get sleepy
or stupid, it's easy to see them being better

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,778
than humans because they already are.

82
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:39,149
Now to describe self-driving cars as cars
at all is like calling the first cars mechanical

83
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,089
horses. Cars in all their forms are so much
more than horses that using the name limits

84
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,709
your thinking about what they can even do.
Lets call self-driving cars what they really

85
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,288
are:

86
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:55,128
Autos: the solution to the transport-objects-from-point-A-to-point-B
problem. Traditional cars happen to be human

87
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:59,668
sized to transport humans but tiny autos can
work in warehouses and gigantic autos can

88
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,538
work in pit mines. Moving stuff around is
who knows how many jobs but the transportation

89
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,318
industry in the United States employs about
three million people. Extrapolating world-wide

90
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,468
that’s something like 70 million jobs at
a minimum.

91
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:15,269
These jobs are over.

92
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,369
The usual argument is that unions will prevent
it. But history is filled with workers who

93
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,869
fought technology that would replace them
and the workers always lose. Economics always

94
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,388
wins and there are huge incentives across
wildly diverse industries to adopt autos.

95
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,748
For many transportation companies, humans
are about a third their total costs. That's

96
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:39,438
just the straight salary costs. Humans sleeping
in their long haul trucks costs time and money.

97
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,068
Accidents cost money. Carelessness costs money.
If you think insurance companies will be against

98
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:48,688
it, guess what? Their perfect driver is one
who pays their small premiums and never gets

99
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:50,098
into an accident.

100
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:54,109
The autos are coming and they're the first
place where most people will really see the

101
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,489
robots changing society. But there are many
other places in the economy where the same

102
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,859
thing is happening, just less visibly.

103
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,939
So it goes with autos, so it goes for everything.

104
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,579
## The Shape of Things to Come

105
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,739
It's easy to look at Autos and Baxters and
think: technology has always gotten rid of

106
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,399
low-skill jobs we don't want people doing
anyway. They'll get more skilled and do better

107
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,899
educated jobs -- like they've always done.

108
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,579
Even ignoring the problem of pushing a hundred-million
additional people through higher education,

109
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,008
white-collar work is no safe haven either.
If your job is sitting in front of a screen

110
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,109
and typing and clicking -- like maybe you're
supposed to be doing right now -- the bots

111
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,538
are coming for you too, buddy.

112
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,598
Software bots are both intangible and way
faster and cheaper than physical robots. Given

113
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,959
that white collar workers are, from a company's
perspective, both more expensive and more

114
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,128
numerous -- the incentive to automate their
work is greater than low skilled work.

115
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:51,008
And that's just what automation engineers
are for. These are skilled programmers whose

116
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,758
entire job is to replace your job with a software
bot.

117
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,938
You may think even the world's smartest automation
engineer could never make a bot to do your

118
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,668
job -- and you may be right -- but the cutting
edge of programming isn't super-smart programmers

119
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:08,588
writing bots, it's super-smart programmers
writing bots that teach themselves how to

120
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,748
do things the programmer could never teach
them to do.

121
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:15,528
How that works is well beyond the scope of
this video, but the bottom line is there are

122
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:20,248
limited ways to show a bot a bunch of stuff
to do, show the bot a bunch of correctly done

123
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,968
stuff, and it can figure out how to do the
job to be done.

124
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:28,098
Even with just a goal and no knowledge of how
to do it the bots can still learn. Take the

125
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:33,678
stock market which, in many ways, is no longer
a human endeavor. It's mostly bots that taught

126
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,158
themselves to trade stocks, trading stocks
with other bots that taught themselves.

127
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,038
As a result, the floor of the New York Stock
exchange isn't filled with traders doing their

128
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,779
day jobs anymore, it's largely a TV set.

129
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,969
So bots have learned the market and bots have
learned to write. If you've picked up a newspaper

130
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,239
lately you've probably already read a story
written by a bot. There are companies that

131
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,939
teach bots to write anything: sports
stories, TPS reports, even say, those quarterly

132
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,729
reports that you write at work.

133
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,679
Paper work, decision making, writing -- a
lot of human work falls into that category

134
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,509
and the demand for human metal labor is these
areas is on the way down. But surely the professions

135
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,999
are safe from bots? Yes?

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,539
## Professional Bots

137
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,889
When you think 'lawyer' it's easy to think
of trials. But the bulk of lawyering is actually

138
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,379
drafting legal documents, predicting the likely
outcome and impact of lawsuits, and something

139
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,729
called 'discovery' which is where boxes of
paperwork gets dumped on the lawyers and they

140
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,609
need to find the pattern or the one out-of-place
transaction among it all.

141
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,699
This can be bot work. Discovery, in particular,
is already not a human job in many law firms.

142
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,419
Not because there isn't paperwork to go through,
there's more of it than ever, but because

143
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,719
clever research bots shift through millions
of emails and memos and accounts in hours

144
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,749
not weeks -- crushing human researchers in
terms of not just cost and time but, most

145
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,809
importantly, accuracy. Bots don't get sleepy
reading through a million emails.

146
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,339
But that's the simple stuff: IBM has a bot
named Watson: you may have seen him on TV

147
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,589
destroy humans at Jeopardy — but that was
just a fun side project for him.

148
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,809
Watson's day-job is to be the best doctor
in the world: to understand what people say

149
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,249
in their own words and give back accurate
diagnoses. And he's already doing that at

150
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,709
Slone-Kettering, giving guidance on lung cancer
treatments.

151
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,699
Just as Auto don’t need to be perfect -- they
just need to make fewer mistakes than humans --

152
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,929
the same goes for doctor bots.

153
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,099
Human doctors are by no means perfect -- the
frequency and severity of misdiagnoses are

154
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,239
terrifying -- and human doctors are severely
limited in dealing with a human's complicated

155
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,939
medical history. Understanding every drug
and every drug's interaction with every other

156
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,939
drug is beyond the scope of human knowability.

157
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,449
Especially when there are research robots
whose whole job it is to test thousands of new

158
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,029
drugs at a time.

159
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,199
And human doctors can only improve through their
own experiences. Doctor bots can learn from

160
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,929
the experiences of every doctor bot. Can read
the latest in medical research and keep track

161
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,189
of everything that happens to all their patients
world-wide and make correlations that would

162
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,759
be impossible to find otherwise.

163
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,349
Not all doctors will go away, but when the doctor
bots are comparable to humans and they're

164
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,849
only as far away as your phone -- the need
for general doctors will be less.

165
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,349
So professionals, white-collar workers and
low-skill workers all have things to worry about

166
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:21,259
from automation. But perhaps you are unfazed because
you're a special creative snowflake. Well

167
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,619
guess what? You're not that special.

168
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,679
## Creative Bots

169
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,679
Creativity may feel like magic, but it isn't.
The brain is a complicated machine -- perhaps

170
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,929
the most complicated machine in the whole
universe -- but that hasn't stopped us from

171
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,219
trying to simulate it.

172
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,049
There is this notion that just as mechanical
muscles allowed us to move into thinking jobs

173
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,509
that mechanical minds will allow us  to
move into creative work.

174
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,449
But even if we assume  the human mind is magically creative -- it's
not, but just for the sake of argument --

175
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,939
artistic creativity isn't what the majority of jobs
depend on. The number of writers and poets

176
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,629
and directors and actors and artists who actually
make a living doing their work is a tiny,

177
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,549
tiny portion of the labor force. And given
that these are professions dependent

178
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,609
on popularity they'll always be a very small
portion of the population.

179
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,799
There can't be such a thing as a poem and painting
based economy.

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,269
Oh, by the way, this music in the background
that you're listening to? It was written by a bot.

181
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,789
Her name is Emily Howell and she can
write an infinite amount of new music all day for free.

182
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,049
And people can't tell the difference between her and human composers

183
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,999
when put to a blind test.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,079
Talking about artificial creativity gets weird
fast -- what does that even mean?

185
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,799
But it's nonetheless a developing field.

186
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,389
People used to think that playing chess was
a uniquely creative human skill that machines

187
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:43,519
could never do right up until they beat the
best of us. And so it will go for all human talents.

188
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,219
## Conclusion

189
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,219
Right: this may have been a lot to take
in, and you might want to reject it -- it's

190
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,609
easy to be cynical of the endless and idiotic
predictions of futures that never are. So

191
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,199
that's why it's important to emphasize again that
this stuff isn't science fiction. The robots

192
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,529
are here right now. There is a terrifying
amount of working automation in labs and warehouses

193
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,469
around the world.

194
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,949
We have been through economic revolutions
before, but the robot revolution is different.

195
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,989
Horses aren't unemployed now because they
got lazy as a species, they’re unemployable.

196
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,439
There's little work a horse can do that do
to pay for its housing and hay.

197
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,619
And many bright, perfectly capable humans
will find themselves the new horse: unemployable

198
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,219
through no fault of their own.

199
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,009
But if you still think new jobs will save
us: here is one final point to consider. The

200
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,619
US census in 1776 tracked only a few kinds
of jobs. Now there are hundreds of kinds of

201
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,869
jobs, but the new ones are not a significant
part of the labor force.

202
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,879
Here's the list of jobs ranked by the number
of people who perform them - it's a sobering

203
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,369
list with the transportation industry at the
top. Continuing downward, all of this work existed

204
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,449
in some form a hundred years ago and almost
all of them are targets for automation. Only

205
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,659
when we get to number 33 on the list is there
finally something new.

206
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,339
Don't that every barista or white collar worker need lose their job before things are a problem.

207
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,009
The unemployment rate during the great depression
was 25%.

208
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:17,359
This list above is 45% of the workforce. Just
what we've talked about today, the stuff that

209
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,519
already works, can push us over that number
pretty soon. And given that even in our modern

210
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:28,209
technological wonderland new kinds of work
aren't a significant portion of the economy,

211
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,989
this is a big problem.

212
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,869
This video isn't about how automation is bad
-- rather that automation is inevitable. It's

213
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,959
a tool to produce abundance for little effort.
We need to start thinking now about what to

214
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,519
do when large sections of the population are
unemployable -- through no fault of their own.

215
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,220
What to do in a future where, for most
jobs, humans need not apply.
