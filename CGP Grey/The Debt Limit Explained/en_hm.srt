1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,249
The debt limit is kind of a financial weapon
of mass destruction chained to the United

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,449
States government by the United States government.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,449
Confused?

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,659
Then it's time for The United States debt
limit Explained.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,678
To understand the debt limit you need to know
the US splits financial responsibility between

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,359
the president and congress.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,809
The president has two jobs when it comes to
money:

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,809
1.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,929
Collect taxes and...
2.

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,989
Spend those taxes to run the government.

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,558
This might give you the impression that the
president, with regards to money, is all-powerful.

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,118
Especially when you hear news reports on 'the
president's new budget' or his plan to 'raise

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,459
taxes on haberdashers' or 'lower taxes on
apiarists'.

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,459
But reality is just the opposite and the president
is the one who takes orders.

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,599
From whom?

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,599
Congress.

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,659
Congress has the jobs of setting the tax level
and determining how much the government will

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,488
spend by writing a budget.

19
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,858
So while the president does get to submit
budgets to congress, and asks for changes

20
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:52,078
in the tax level, these are just requests
that congress doesn't have to pay attention

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,078
to.

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,779
Congress can add or subtract anything they
want from the president's budget or throw

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,019
it out entirely and write a new one.

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,339
The same goes for the level of taxes.

25
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,169
So congress decides what it wants: bridges,
tanks, buildings, courts, robots on Mars,

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,979
robots on Earth, National Parks, whatever
and approves a budget with that stuff in it.

27
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,019
Once approved the president's is required
by law to spend the money Congress listed

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,089
in the budget and pay for it using the taxes
that congress set.

29
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,099
As long as more taxes come in than spending
goes out everything is fine.

30
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,699
But, almost always, Congress puts more stuff
in the budget than they cover with taxes which

31
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,508
means the president must borrow money to cover
the difference.

32
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:33,469
In most countries the story ends here because
if their legislatures approved more spending

33
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,599
than they have income, they've also implicitly
approved the necessary borrowing -- but not

34
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,599
in America.

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,798
Here Congress *also* limits the total amount
of debt the United States can have.

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,099
A debt limit sounds like a good idea until
you see the real-world consequences of these

37
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,449
two branches of government interacting.

38
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,459
As the total amount borrowed gets closer to
the limit, Congress usually points to the

39
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,118
president and acts shocked, *shocked* that
his reckless spending has brought us so close

40
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,868
to the debt limit that they, reasonable, prudent
Congress have set.

41
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,279
And while it's technically correct that the
president has borrowed this money, congress

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,659
has forced him to do it, by approving a budget
that the president is legally obligated to

43
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,449
spend without also approving the necessary
taxes to cover that spending.

44
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,279
So the debt limit fight is essentially the
government version of the playground favorite:

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,219
'stop hitting yourself' except with added
terror for everyone watching.

46
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,829
For, it's important to note, the debt limit
is not about future spending -- it's not a

47
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,869
credit card on which the limit will be raised
so a crazy government party can be thrown

48
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,749
-- the debt limit is about paying bills already
incurred.

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,249
For example, the government hires a company
to repave a federal highway.

50
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,989
But if the US is at the debt limit, when the
company asks to be paid after the work has

51
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,749
been done, the government can't.

52
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,949
This shakes trust in the US and since large
parts of the global economy depend on the

53
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,469
dollar being trust worthy, messing with that
trust is a big deal.

54
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,349
But there is a way out: Congress can raise
the debt limit and, because of the aforementioned

55
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,999
terror, they always have.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,289
So… if not raising the debt ceiling is potentially
disastrous and the solution is simple and

57
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,699
always taken in the end: *why does this debate
last months‽*

58
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,699
Because: politics.

59
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,729
The debt limit isn't in the constitution,
congress created it themselves and from their

60
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,619
point of view, the debt limit is awesome because:

61
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,619
1.

62
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,909
It creates a problem that
2.

63
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,679
Congress can (technically) blame on the president
who

64
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,679
3.

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,889
Needs the solution that only they can provide

66
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,849
Congress gets to use the threat of mutual
financial self destruction as leverage in

67
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,039
negations that they benefit from extending
until the last… possible…

68
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,900
second.
