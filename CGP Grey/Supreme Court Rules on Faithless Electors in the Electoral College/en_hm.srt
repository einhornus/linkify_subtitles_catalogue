00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,947
Hello Internet.

2
00:00:00,948 --> 00:00:04,789
Time for a quick update regarding everyone's favorite voting system:

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,336
The Electoral College.

4
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:11,049
America'sâ€¦ *idiosyncratic* method of picking her president.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,652
It's been unchanged (mostly) for centuries, but this video exists because,

6
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:20,941
in July 2020, there was some Supreme Court popcorn about faithless electors,

7
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:24,052
one of the most controversial mechanisms of the system.

8
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:26,132
Lightning quick Electoral College recap.

9
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:29,927
The states get votes for president proportional-ish to their populations.

10
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:33,732
For most citizens, how many votes their state gets is all they need to know.

11
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,359
But for you watching this video,

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,179
you want to go down a level below to know what the deal is with

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,359
faithless electors, and the NaPoVoInterCo plan, and this new ruling.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,759
So the level below is that the state votes aren't really votes.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,709
They're people.

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,369
After the national election, a state doesn't cast their number of votes,

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,179
but rather appoints that number of people to vote for president in their capital,

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,819
and it's all of these people in their respective state capitols who are the electors.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,019
And it's their votes that truly decide the president.

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,239
Side Note: at this point everyone always asks, "Who are these people?"

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,339
And the answer is they're chosen in advance by the parties and they're usually local party officials.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,109
Each party picks their own group of electors,

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,509
and so the national election is really a way each state decides which of the

24
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,349
pre-approved groups will do the real voting for president.

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,799
Anyway, here's where faithless elector's come in.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,469
These electors are supposed to vote for the official candidate of the party that picked them.

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,329
But they don't have to.

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,639
Back in the 1700s, the idea was that by the time all the electors got together,

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,369
there was going to be a lot more they could know about the candidates

30
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,499
and the current political situation than voters back home could ever have known.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,919
Remember, communication at the time wasn't with smart phones or with telegraphs,

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,189
but with letters carried by a dude on a horse.

33
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,349
So if you wanted to be up-to-date on politics, you had to be in the capital where it was happening.

34
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,669
Which is why the electors had to meet in person.

35
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,439
And also why it took place weeks later.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,239
Because there were no trains either.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,179
All this is to say that if you were an elector in 1796, by the time you got to the capital,

38
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,339
and caught up on the news,

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,909
there might be good reasons you'd want to switch your vote and become a faithless elector.

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,789
Though it turned out over the centuries this rarely happened,

41
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,489
and never in enough numbers to change the president,

42
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,389
but the possibility of a post-national-election, pre-inaguration presidential switch has always been present,

43
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,279
either as a final gambit from the losing side,

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,749
or because a disagreeing faction on the winning side was glad to have won,

45
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,389
but not glad about the candidate they won with and so would would like to swap.

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,329
Either of these faithless coups would, in modern times, doubtless cause citizen outrage,

47
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,699
but would nonetheless be a-okay with the Electoral College rules.

48
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,079
That's faithless electors.

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,399
Which if you believe most news headlines, the Supreme Court has just banned.

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,399
But of course, not exactly.

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,019
In their 2020 decision, the Court ruled states *may* pass laws preventing faithless electors.

52
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,559
And that's it.

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,549
The Supreme Court herself hasn't prevented anything.

54
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,729
In fact, this case is a bit of a nothing burger.

55
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,629
A unanimous decision that states can tell their electors what to do.

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,549
Based on this line in the Constitution, the Court interpreted

57
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,969
as "conveying the broadest power of determination" over electors and their actions.

58
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,659
That interpretation is not from the 2020 case, by the way, but from an 1892 case.

59
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,109
The Court just reaffirmed it.

60
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,559
So the states telling their electors what to do is nothing new.

61
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,909
Which is why, at the time of the 2020 Court decision, 32 states already had laws preventing faithless electors.

62
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,169
This modern decision is just the Supreme Court giving a casual thumbs up.

63
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,659
As for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Plan (explained here),

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,009
this ruling has no strong feelings one way or the other.

65
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,609
It's entirely about binding electors to their party.

66
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,609
And not at all about how a state picks which group of electors to send,

67
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,739
which is the whole basis of the NaPoVoInterCo plan,

68
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,369
and will yield plenty more Supreme Court popcorn if it ever gets enacted.

69
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,839
But for now, absolutely nothing has changed.

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:29,880
[soft chill music]
