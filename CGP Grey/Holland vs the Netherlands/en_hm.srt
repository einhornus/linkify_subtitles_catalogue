1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:04,528
Welcome to the Great nation of Holland: where
the tulips grow, the windmills turn, the breakfast

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,939
is chocolatey, the people industrious, and
the sea tries to drown it all.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,059
Except, this country isn't Holland.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,059
It's time for:

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,819
The Difference Between Holland, the Netherlands
(and a whole lot more)

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,319
The correct name for this tulip growing, windmill
building hagelslag eating, container ship

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,909
moving, ocean conquering nation is the Netherlands.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,679
But confusion is understandable -- the general
region been renamed a lot over a thousand

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,339
including as: The Dutch Republic, The United
States of Belgium, and The Kingdom of Hollande

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,979
But it's not just history that makes this
country's name confusing because the Netherlands

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,128
is divided into twelve provinces:

12
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:36,178
* Groningen
* Drenthe

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,238
* Overijssel
* Gelderland

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,488
* Limburg
* Brabant

15
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,729
* Zeeland (Which, by the way, is the Zeeland
that makes this Zeeland, new)

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,669
* Friesland (With adorable little hearts on
its flag)

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,358
* Flevoland
* Utrecht, and here's the confusion:

18
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,638
* Noord (North) Holland and
* Zuid (South) Holland

19
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:52,748
These provinces make calling the Netherlands
'Holland' like calling the United States 'Dakota'.

20
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:56,349
Though unlike the Dakotas, which are mostly
empty, save for the occasional Jackalope,

21
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,509
the two Hollands are the most populated provinces
and have some of the biggest attractions like,

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,048
Amsterdam and Keukenhof.

23
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:05,919
Chances are if it's Dutch, and you've heard
of it, it's in one of the Hollands.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,779
Even the government's travel website for the
country is Holland.com -- officially because

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,139
it sounds friendlier, but unofficially it's
probably what people are actually searching

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,139
for.

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,489
Confusion continues because: People who live
in the Hollands are called Hollanders, but

28
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,839
all citizens of the Netherlands are called
Dutch as is their language.

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,288
But in Dutch they say: Nederlands sprekende
Nederlanders in Nederland which sounds like

30
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:29,209
they'd rather we call them Netherlanders speaking
Netherlandish.

31
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,478
Meanwhile, next door in Germany, they're Deutsche
sprechen Deutsch in Deutschland.

32
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,839
Which sounds like they'd rather be called
Dutch.

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,499
This linguistic confusion is why Americans
call the Pennsylvania Dutch Dutch even though

34
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,608
they're Germans.

35
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:43,398
To review: this country is the Netherlands,
its people are Dutch, they speak Dutch.

36
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,828
There is no country called Holland, but there
are provinces of North and South Holland.

37
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:48,828
Got it?

38
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:49,908
Great, because it's about to get more complicated.

39
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,788
The Netherlands is part of a Kingdom with
the same name: The Kingdom of the Netherlands

40
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,798
-- which is headed by the Dutch Royal Family.

41
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,228
The Kingdom of the Netherlands contains three
more countries and to find them we must sail

42
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,269
from the icy North Sea to the Caribbean and
Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten.

43
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,818
These are no territories, but self-governing
countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands

44
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,029
and as such they have their own governments,
and their own currencies.

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,619
Geography geek side note here:

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,829
While Aruba and Curaçao are islands, Sint
Maarten is just the Southern Half of a tiny

47
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,039
island also named Saint Martin the other half
of which is occupied by France and also named

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,039
Saint Martin.

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,249
So despite being separated by Belgium on the
European map, The Kingdom of the Netherlands

50
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,349
and the French Republic share a border on
the other side of the world on an island so

51
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,109
nice they named it thrice.

52
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,159
But why does the Kingdom of the Netherlands
reach to the Caribbean anyway?

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,609
Because, Empire.

54
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,359
In the 1600s the Dutch, always looking to
expand business, laid their hands on every

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,919
valuable port they could.

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,119
For a time, America's East Coast was 'New
Netherland' with its capital city of New Amsterdam.

57
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,289
There was New Zealand, as mentioned previously,
and nearby, the king of the islands, New Holland.

58
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,769
Though the empire is gone, these three Caribbean
nations remain.

59
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,349
And while four countries in one kingdom, isn't
unheard of, it doesn't stop there, because

60
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,759
the country of the Netherlands, also extends
its borders to the Caribbean and three more

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,309
islands: Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba.

62
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,099
These are not countries in a Kingdom, but
are cities of the Country of the Netherlands

63
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,479
and they look the part.

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,149
Residents of these far-flung cities vote in
elections for the Dutch government just as

65
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,309
any Hollander would.

66
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,559
Though, weirdly, they don't belong to any
province and they don't use the Dutch currency

67
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,039
of Euros, they use Dollars instead.

68
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,999
It's kind of like if Hawaii wasn't a state,
but technically part of the District of Columbia,

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,719
all the while using the Yen.

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,959
These cities of the Country of the Netherlands
and these countries in the Kingdom of the

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,489
Netherlands, are together are known as the
Dutch Caribbean.

72
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,309
And their citizens are Dutch citizens.

73
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,319
Which, because the Kingdom of the Netherlands
is a member of the European Union, means these

74
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,629
Dutch Caribbeans are also Europeans.

75
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,369
So in the end, there are 6 Caribbean islands,
four countries, twelve provinces, two Hollands,

76
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,870
two Netherlands and one kingdom, all Dutch.
