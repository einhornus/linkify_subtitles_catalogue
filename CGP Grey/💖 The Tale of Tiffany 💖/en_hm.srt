1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,179
Tiffany, is a very neon 80s name, and not
without reason,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,929
it exploded in popularity during the decade.
But despite Tiffany's modern sound the name

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,309
wasn't born in the 80s.
Tiffany is at least, 80 decades old.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,199
["OMG that's like, positively medieval." "How
is that? And then why is this?"]

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,729
Well, let me tell you the tale of tracking
Tiffany through time.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,788
It starts in the year 300, with this guy,
Eusebius.

7
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:29,929
A historian and bishop in the Holy Land.
He wrote a treatise *On The Divine Manifestation,*

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,509
and the word for that in the Greek he wrote
was *Theophania*.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,189
In ye olden days religious virtue names were
totally a thing

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,488
and Theophania became a name given to children
born on the feast of The Epiphany.

11
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:45,249
Though no five syllable name can go unnicked,
so for some rhyming sage a Tiffany Epiphany

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,049
was inevitable.
The name, thus born in the Holy Land,

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,428
then spread with the Greek language.
The most famous example appears in 972

14
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:55,999
with the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire,
who's name is written this way and

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,709
probably pronounced *tay-off-ahnu*.
Ancient pronunciation isâ€¦

16
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,459
a whole other thing that we are going to skip
(becauseit'sunknowable)

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,389
and it doesn't help that the Empress's name
is listed in different ways,

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,089
so it's impossible to know if she want by
[Tay-off-ahnu or Theophania, or Tee-o-phania]

19
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,559
which are all close to Tiffany, but not quite.
Who knows. Maybe she shortened it and her

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,239
title was
[Tiff, Empress of the Empire. The top Tiff.]

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,449
But that's just speculation.
When this word first became a Tiffany name

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,389
precursor
isn't exactly known.

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,239
[Spoiler for History]
Pre-printing press, there's not a lot of written

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,949
evidence, for anything
and lot's of documents that did exist got

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,728
lost.
So to tell the totality of the tale takes

26
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:36,398
trusses of trust
betwixt islands of evidence.

27
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,569
It's time to try to find the true old-time
Tiffs.

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,839
By working backwards through hundreds of years
of census books,

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,869
and if you did that in English, you wouldn't
find much,

30
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,648
thanks for nothing *Doomsday Book*.
But if you also looked in French you could

31
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,599
find Tiphaine Raguenel,
born 1335, about whom all information is delightful.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,179
A noble lady astrologer who lived in
France's fairy tale castle Mont St Michael

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,699
and used her astrological powers to predict
the outcome

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,849
of her husband's knighting battles.
[Hey honey, maybe don't go to that one.]

35
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,787
And she was righter than wronger
because he survived to ascend to become the

36
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,479
[Grand Constable of France, First Officer
of the Crown.]

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,479
On the island there's still a little museum
to her, and her husband.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,279
Though the one thing you won't find in that
museum is her skull,

39
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,179
which was turned up just a few years ago
in a reliquary box in town of Dinan

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,429
with a note on it saying *this is the skull
of Tiphaine Raguenel*

41
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,969
and given anonymously to the local library.
So, that's a thing that happened.

42
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,909
Wait, why are we talking about this?
Oh right, because this is oldest Tiffany,

43
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,369
that's pretty much spelled Tiffany,
and about whom details of her life are known.

44
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,208
But were you to keep going backwards through
the census books

45
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,729
you'd also strike a Trio of Tiffanies in Paris
in 1313,

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,149
but all that is known about them is their
listed professions:

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,559
wax maker, washer woman and spinster.
A woman who spins wool into thread.

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,629
Thus this foursome of French Tiffany's written
records are the proof

49
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,919
that Tiffany is totally neon medieval.
Though you might be wondering exactly

50
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,289
how did a Greek name from here,
end up on a Fancy French Tiffany over here?

51
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,279
ME TOO!
So if you kept looking through every old document

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,548
that might be a list of names for,
hundreds of hours.

53
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,329
If you were lucky you would eventually stubble
on the

54
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,068
*Transcripts of Charters relating to Gilbertine
Houses* from 1161

55
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,149
containing a single Tiffany,
well Tephany with an e p h,

56
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,939
but that's close enough to count,
who lived in Fotherby, England.

57
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,518
How did she get there?
Well, we must across another Truss of Trust,

58
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,169
but Tephany had a Grandfather named Hugh,
who was at just the right time and place

59
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,109
to travel to the Holy Land in
the First Crusade.

60
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,559
And going through the surviving records of
Crusaders from the time

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,969
there are candidate Hughs,
and while I can't prove the Tephany/Hugh connection

62
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,568
100%,
which *kills* me.

63
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,458
I'm still calling it that Grandpa Hugh on
his travels

64
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,109
came across an Epiphany Tiffany
and brought the name back to middle England,

65
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,268
and the English language.
As did also French Crusaders to France.

66
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,469
It all fits!
But it does leave the question,

67
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,568
if Tiffany in its modern form is near a millennia
old,

68
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,089
why don't we think of it that way?
Probably just historical happenstance.

69
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,958
A lack of famous Tiffany's.
There were no queens born on the Epiphany

70
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,628
to be named Tiffany
leaving Theophanu as the most prominent Tiffany,

71
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:10,109
except not exactly a Tiffany,
and Tiphanie Raguenel isn't particularly famous,

72
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,908
until hopefully now, that is.
If you go on your own french Tiffany Crusade,

73
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:17,838
be sure to tell 'em Grey sent you.
So, aside from these two, the name never landed

74
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,699
on fame to pop in popularity like it would
later.

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,139
Just sporadically showing up in written records
in the late 17 and 1800s.

76
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,420
Which, as an alternate history side note,
it does mean that at the time when

77
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:31,069
Jane Austen was writing *Emma*,
the name Tiffany was infrequently around

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,169
with its exact modern spelling.
So if the authoress was looking for an underused

79
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,409
name
with literary potential,

80
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,029
she could have picked Tiffany
and turned the Georgian and Victorian eras

81
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,529
neon as well.
And, I mean, come on, the name Tiffany Woodhouse

82
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,929
is tots perfect for the character.
But sadly, it didn't happen,

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,139
and Tiffany remained a name, without fame.
She would get there,

84
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,139
but jumping backwards,
she first she needed to transform.

85
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,979
In 1629, Tiffany does appears on an English
census,

86
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,379
*finally*
this time, for the *first* time

87
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,719
as a last name with one Mr. Henry Tiffany,
who lived and died in Hackney London.

88
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,549
Ok, so he wasn't born a Tiffany.
Were you to track down his christening,

89
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,159
you'd find he was Henry Tiffin at the time,
but once grown up and married,

90
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,579
the record now shows him as the first of the
family of Tiffany.

91
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,979
Why the name change?
It probably wasn't one.

92
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,609
Consistent spelling in the English language
totally wasn't a thing back then.

93
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,499
None other than Tiffen/Tiffany's contemporary
William Shakespeare

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,249
never spelled his signature the same way twice.
English was [and still kind of is] very

95
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,559
*whatever* with the written word.
So Henry Tiffan became Tiffany randomly,

96
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,799
and because the world is just too perfect
sometimes,

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,149
I'm *also* calling it that this Mr. Tiffany,
the first to appear with the last name in

98
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,159
English language,
is directly responsible for *this* explosion

99
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,309
of Tiffany's
400 years later.

100
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,159
Come with me.
So Henry Tiffany had a son in 1630,

101
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,019
Humphrey Tiffany who moved to the shiny New
England

102
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,839
sometime before 1660.
Humphry Tiffany took the name to America,

103
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,119
and simultaneously removed it from England
as a last name

104
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,549
as he was Henry Tiffany's only surviving son
who would also have a son.

105
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,059
James Tiffany in 1666.
From there James Tiffany Jr., 1697

106
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,809
to Ebineezer Tiffany, 1734
to Comfort Tiffany, 1777

107
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,159
to 1812 Charles Lewis Tiffany.
Which has caused some bulbs in the audience

108
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,079
to light.
But to follow though.

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,019
Charles Lewis Tiffany, with some friends,
established a stationary and fancy goods emporium

110
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,339
shop named
Tiffany, Young and Ellis, in 1837.

111
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,819
Charles Lewis Tiffany eventually took control
of the company,

112
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,099
changed the name to *Tiffany & Co*
to focus on jewelry exclusively,

113
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,659
well except for that period during the Civil
War

114
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,519
when he switched to manufacturing swords as
the Tiffany's Experience,

115
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,659
but after that, back to jewelry.
From the late 1800s this New York City store,

116
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,749
for Tiffany was her most prominent placement,
since the Empress or the Astrologer,

117
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,589
and it remained so until 1958 when Truman
Capote walked by.

118
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,969
The name caught the author's attention
as underused with literary potential.

119
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,689
And he wrote and published the Novella
*Breakfast at Tiffany's*.

120
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,959
Prior to this moment Tiffany as a first name
was holding on, but barely.

121
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,839
Averaging under ten babies a year.
After the Novella, there's a slight uptick

122
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,159
in the name,
but that could be a coincidence,

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,589
but what definitely isn't is in 1961,
the novella became a movie staring Audrey

124
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,369
Hepbun,
and it would not be understatement to say

125
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,719
that this role
turned her into time-transcending Hollywood

126
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,009
icon,
forever connected with the name in the title.

127
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,709
Tiffany had found her fame.
And the following year the Tiffany's, quintupled!

128
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,189
Setting a solid base for an exponential explosion,
and grew over the next twenty years

129
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,379
as children grew, having seen the movie,
to have children of their own.

130
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,439
Bringing us to 1979 and there are almost 10,000
Tiffany's a year.

131
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,329
Now, we are still on a Truss of Trust for
this Tiffany Theory,

132
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,729
maybe isn't wasn't the store, turned story,
turned movie.

133
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,329
It could have been a coincidence.
If you look at enough random events

134
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,409
you can always draw some convincing correlations.
But, remember, that in ye olden days of the

135
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,559
60s and early 70s
movies could only be seen in theaters.

136
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,349
But by the late 70s there was a new invention.
VHS.

137
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,989
The video home system
So you could watch movies, any time in glorious

138
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,039
480 pixels.
And well, guess what?!?

139
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,879
*Breakfast at Tiffany's* happens to be the
first

140
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,899
Audrey Hepburn movie released on VHS in,
wait for it,

141
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,219
1979.
And one year later total Tiffany's doubled.

142
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,239
Rolling into the 80s torrent of Tiffanies,
where the name was Top Twenty for nine out

143
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,209
of ten years.
The Tiffany ascendancy that had started with

144
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,409
Theophany, in prehistory.
And that is the tale of Tiffany.

145
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,689
She's carried her neon torch though the ages.
And long make she carry it into the future.

146
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,060
To Tiffany.
