1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,959
Before this video loaded you probably watched an ad and/or one will appear right about...

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,459
 

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,359
now.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,899
How did this exact ad get on this video?

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,839
And, what you really want to know, how much money do these things make?

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,899
Okay, there are three players in this game.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,079
Creators who create videos, advertisers who make the ads, and YouTube, who plays matchmaker matchmaker making the match.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,739
Now, unlike old dying media where a dude in a room could place ads on predictable known content at a leisurely schedule,

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,239
YouTube doesn't work like that. Can't work like that, because on YouTube, there is no schedule.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,139
At any moment a wild viral video can appear.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,359
On a normal day 65 years' worth of video are uploaded to YouTube,

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,819
and people watch a billion hours of video.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,979
It's an endless waterfall of random content that just keeps growing.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,259
Hiring enough humans to categorize all of those videos and match ads to them would be impossible,

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,999
This, is a job for bots.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,319
The moment each new video is uploaded, YouTube's bots get to work, looking at the title, the keywords, the captions, the comments, the controversy,

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,779
All to make their best guess as to what category it belongs in.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:12,239
Meanwhile, advertisers tell their own bots what category of videos they want their ads to run against, and what kind to avoid.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,599
And here is where YouTube earns their money: between when you click on a video and when it plays, a YouTube bot holds an auction,

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,759
announcing the categories it's guessed the video is in, opening the floor to all interested advertiser bots to place their bids.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,739
The winning advertiser bot is the one with the ad that will most likely make YouTube and the creator the most money at that instant.

22
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,319
But that's not necessarily the highest bidder -- different ads pay in different ways.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,199
For example,

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,479
skippable video ads, the advertiser doesn't pay if the viewer skips as soon as they can.

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,259
The advertiser only pays if their ad is clicked or watched.

26
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,679
A super high bid means nothing if the ad is super boring.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,899
No clicks equals no dollars for YouTube or the creator.

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,019
So, there's a bias against boring: the auctioneer bot will prefer a lower bid for an ad with a higher click rate,

29
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,319
than a higher bid for an ad with a lower click rate.

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,719
But boring is in the eye of the beholder,

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,999
so in addition to YouTube's bots trying to guess what the video is about,

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,159
there are bots that try to guess what the viewer is about.

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,299
Looking at their watch history and device and activity to try and guess their age, chromosomes, income, location, and interests.

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,179
This information, too, is part of the auction,

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,199
and the advertisers can instruct their bots to only bid to specific demographics in specific locations in specific categories,

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,199
and only up to specific amounts.

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,999
So whatever ad you saw before this video didn't plan to be there, it was the result of

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,159
bot guesses about the video, and bot guesses about you, and bot bids for your attention at that exact millisecond.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,479
Watch videos from this channel on the device of someone demographically different and you'll see different kinds of ads.

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,399
You should try it with this video on at least two or three or four...

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,419
look watch this video on a lot of different devices.

42
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,979
Anyway,

43
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,999
If you want to know how much advertisers pay YouTube and creators, there isn't one answer.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,499
It's all an insta-auction and varies wildly by video category,

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,999
the viewers, the time of year, advertising budget, how many auctions are happening at that exact moment,

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,039
and how full they are.

47
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,579
It's millions of matches a minute of supply and demand.

48
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,859
Channels with prized demographics may earn five times as much per view as other channels.

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,319
But....

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,399
You and I both know there's still some kind of average number.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,479
Something to use as a ballpark, and that's what you want to know.

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,539
On average,

53
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,679
this number,

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,179
how many Benjamins?

55
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,379
Okay, a reasonable estimate is one view is worth

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:30,879
one quarter

57
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,179
one quarter of one penny,

58
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,659
one quarter of one penny, split between YouTube and the creator.

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,639
which is the first time a penny has proven too great a measure of value.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,119
So, a better way to think about it is 1000 views generates about $2.50 of advertising dollars.

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,259
YouTube then splits that money between the creator and themselves, fifty five - forty five

62
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,459
About $1.40 for the creator and $1.10 for YouTube.

63
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,539
Or, if you want to think big about it,

64
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,799
every million views is $1,400 for the creator, and $1,100 for YouTube.

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,299
again,

66
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,419
On average.

67
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,359
Particular channels might be splitting 50 cents per thousand or 4.50 per thousand.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,839
It all depends on the auction.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,079
So that's how it works.

70
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,459
A Niagara of content, sorted and sold by bots, to bots, for humans to watch.

71
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,759
* background music moves to foreground *

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:34,340
* end slate music *
