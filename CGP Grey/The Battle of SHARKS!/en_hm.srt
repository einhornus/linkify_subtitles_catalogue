1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,435
While riding my bike around London, I stumbled upon this and was like

2
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:09,419
Surprise sharks raise questions that need answers.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,699
So once back home, to Google I went,

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,402
with a search query that would turn

5
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:16,005
the next six weeks of my life real weird

6
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,497
with phone calls and legal consultations and

7
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:21,414
hundreds of pages of documentation about zoning,

8
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:23,672
but it started with "I'm feeling lucky"

9
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:26,860
which landed me on a Guardian newspaper article about the sharks.

10
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,583
They're part of an art competition.

11
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:30,989
Apparently shark art has a history in England.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,539
Okay, I guess…

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,472
But the article said the sharks were next to

14
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:36,657
a warehouse in the London Borough of Hackney

15
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:39,186
but I found them next to a boat club in Islington.

16
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:41,229
Well, can't just let a thing like that go!

17
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,328
[Oh, ah, haha.  Give me a second.  Been at this for awhile.]

18
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,528
Okay, so back to Google, where I found Antepavilion,

19
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,700
the warehouse hosting the art competition,

20
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,891
with a giant balloon outside?

21
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:56,017
Okay, dontgetdistracted, you're here for the shark art competition!

22
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:58,897
But wait, Hackney Fight?  What's this?

23
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,202
And so it began.

24
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:02,509
It seemed like because of the sharks, Hackney Borough

25
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,854
was trying to get this warehouse/artist studio place shut down.

26
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:08,848
But the more I read, the weirder it got.

27
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:11,463
Like this Correspondence with the Police?

28
00:01:11,464 --> 00:01:16,257
About their forced entry into the warehouse to stop a ballet performance…

29
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:17,131
What?!

30
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:18,540
Okay.  Too much.

31
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,506
Stop.  Back.  Back.  Back to the original competition,

32
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:40,922
which had asked art entrants to consider quote,

33
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:42,503
One entrant? SHARKS!

34
00:01:42,504 --> 00:01:43,869
Five of them, full-scale

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,008
(the big one's a megalodon)

36
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,639
leaping from the water, singing.

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,789
The title of this piece SHARKS! with an exclamation mark.

38
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,155
What could compete with that?  Nothing.

39
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,869
Which is why SHARKS! won and construction began.

40
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:59,162
Cool, but like, what's the deal with the beef in this brief?

41
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:03,642
Well, now weeks later and after way more hours of stress

42
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:05,937
than I ever expected from this project,

43
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,662
I can now tell you a very simplified version of

44
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,482
what happened for comprehensibility reasons.

45
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,783
And legal reasons.

46
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,808
It starts five years ago, when Antepavilion

47
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:18,755
held their first art competition with winner H-VAC.

48
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:22,688
A sitting area atop the warehouse roof from which to admire the canal.

49
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,411
It's disguised... disguised... as an air duct

50
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,762
to hide from Hackney and planning permission.

51
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:31,488
The next year's winner was an inflatable yellow barge.

52
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:32,565
That's what this is.

53
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,789
Also, did you notice H-VAC the first time?

54
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,848
[gleefully]
Admit it, you didn't, cuz it's disguised.

55
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,509
Anyway.  The barge inflated so it could be a pop-up transportable venue space

56
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,635
that could deflate and disappear at a moments notice.

57
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:47,075
And also so it could fit under London's many tiny canal bridges

58
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,439
like the ones on either side of the warehouse.

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,460
The year after's winner

60
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,789
(I swear this is all connected)

61
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,829
the Potemkin Theater.

62
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,629
It's just one wall, nothing to see here,

63
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,743
but also serves as the backdrop for a stage on the roof.

64
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:00,934
It was this last art erection,

65
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:03,002
the opposite of incognito,

66
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:05,826
that drew the attention of the London Borough of Hackney.

67
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:46,725
"Oi," Said Hackney.

68
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,909
Thus, these three arts are the history of how the Hackney hatchet came down.

69
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,605
But Antepavilion didn't remove their art,

70
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:56,337
instead basing their brief on these events,

71
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:59,408
and picking the purposefully provocative Sharks! as the winner.

72
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,183
Now as their construction finished and installation approached

73
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:04,632
what happened next is... debated.

74
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:07,137
Antepavilion says The Guardian approached them to do

75
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,645
an article about Sharks!.

76
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:11,340
A telephone interview conducted and an article written.

77
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:14,663
The very article I would find months later, after publication.

78
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:18,422
But pre-publication, according to Antepavilion, the article contained,

79
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:21,223
"defamatory misquotes" and "deliberate misrepresentations."

80
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:25,223
Antepavilion requested it be changed and wanted a copy of the recorded interview.

81
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,223
The Guardian refused to change anything,

82
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:30,823
didn't comment on the recording, instead asking for what the misquote was,

83
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:33,839
leading Antepavilion to ask for the recording of the interview

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,968
and around and around it went.

85
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:38,712
Anyway, The Guardian's article, which did get published as written

86
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,451
and may or may not have misrepresented Antepavilion,

87
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:44,454
may or may not have tipped off the London Borough of Hackney

88
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,515
that Antepavilion was art-ing again,

89
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:50,786
soon to install the extremely impossible-not-to-notice Sharks!

90
00:04:50,787 --> 00:04:53,580
Hackney packed the paper in their little briefcase to use as evidence

91
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:58,719
as they ran to a London judge to grant an emergency injunction to stop Sharks!

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,432
They had to run because that very morning the sharks were being loaded into the canal.

93
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,679
One shark in the water.

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,697
[epic electronic music]

95
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:10,042
Two sharks in the water.

96
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,202
[epic electronic music]

97
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,565
Three sharks in the water.

98
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,731
[epic electronic music]

99
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:17,666
[Grey]
Four shar...

100
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,429
[Hackney]
Shop that shark!

101
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,149
[Hackney]
INJUNCTED!

102
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,639
[Antepavilion]
Wait, let me see that. Oooh, this is very confusing.

103
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,309
I need to check with my lawyer about what this means.

104
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,609
Four sharks in the water.

105
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,688
[Hackney]
No seriously!

106
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,115
IN-JUNC-TED!

107
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:33,315
[Grey]
And thus Hackney blocked the final shark and halted Antepavilion

108
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:37,045
from doing anything without express planning permission until further judgment.

109
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,851
[Hackney]
Look here, you're in a conservation area, you can't just do what you want.

110
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:41,586
[Grey]
But, four sharks had escaped.

111
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:44,011
And the injunction didn't require their removal.

112
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:46,085
So, in the canal they stayed.

113
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:49,500
While trapped inside, the final fifth looked on.

114
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,079
Thus in this moment, the halted Sharks!

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,869
became the pitch perfect presentation of

116
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,863
planning permission versus artistic freedom

117
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:58,645
as the paperwork grew from injunctions to

118
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:01,168
witness statements, permission applications, briefs,

119
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,365
reports on the history of art on the site,

120
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:06,177
what "in keeping with the conservation area" means,

121
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:08,768
queries of if Sharks! block the canal traffic,

122
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,819
[Hey, wait!  Who actually controls the canal?]

123
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,749
and arguments about if the very existence of the conservation area is,

124
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,919
like an abuse of power, or a scam?

125
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,577
[I have no legal stance here please don't sue me.]

126
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:23,469
I can't say a tenth of what I've heard, but, well,

127
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,719
the two bridges are conserved, the canal is a conservation area,

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,682
but the conservation area also happens to swoop up to include this one warehouse,

129
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,423
and it's Hackney who can block building in a conservation area

130
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:41,586
and it's also Hackney that gets to draw where the conservation area is.

131
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:45,235
I mean, it's a lovely warehouse but... hmmmm.

132
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:47,642
However, the thing is, to Antepavilion,

133
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:51,432
all of these literally hundreds and hundreds of pages

134
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:56,149
of legal documentation and countless human hours of everyone involved

135
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,731
in a fight over shark sculpture are part of art of Sharks! itself.

136
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:04,645
Even the judges dragged into this make comments in their dry way,

137
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:07,272
about what a tangled pain this case is.

138
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:10,257
Sidenote: I particularly enjoyed how since the title of Sharks!

139
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,592
includes an exclamation mark,

140
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:14,282
so too must all these legal documents,

141
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,319
which was funny every time I read it.

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,131
Sharks!

143
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,448
Okay, back to the story.

144
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,682
For months, Sharks! chilled outside the warehouse while the paperwork rained down,

145
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:27,088
though Hackney did eventually get them double injuncted and forced back inside.

146
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:30,842
Meanwhile, up the canal happens to be the Islington Boat Club,

147
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:34,417
members of which apparently chugged by sometimes to watch the ballet,

148
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:37,279
and who developed a soft spot in their heart for Sharks!

149
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,832
and they had water rights in their section of the canal

150
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,657
and so decided to offer their club as a new home.

151
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:44,737
Antepavilion agreed to move the sharks

152
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:48,140
contingent on the Boat Club promising to tell Antepavilion about any

153
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:50,559
bureaucratic paperwork problems that might arise.

154
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,589
[Antepavilion]
Are you guys sure you have rights to the water?

155
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,103
[Grey]
As all those future papers would be part of the art of Sharks! too.

156
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:58,842
The Boat Club agreed, and the sharks were brought up the canal

157
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,688
to where they currently reside,

158
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,214
delightfully right in full view of a primary school,

159
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:06,454
that doubtless all the kids there now call shark school,

160
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:09,279
and right next to a public playground where Sharks!

161
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,940
is already inspiring the next generation of English shark artists

162
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:16,602
and where you too can go see them in their full sharkyness.

163
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:21,242
But, if you do want to see them, you better hurry while you can.

164
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,912
See, sometime after the relocation,

165
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:26,491
the Islington Boat Club told Antepavilion,

166
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,491
[Islington Boat Club]
Look you need to take your sharks back, mate.

167
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:29,186
[Antepavilion
Why?

168
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:31,039
[Islington Boat Club]
Ahhhhh, we won't tell you.

169
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,906
[Antepavilion
But why?

170
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:35,691
[Grey]
And then the Boat Club ghosted Antepavilion never to give a reason.

171
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:40,085
What happened is unknown, but if one were to speculate

172
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,777
[I have no legal stance here please don't sue me.]

173
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:43,308
the Boat Club seems…

174
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,208
underdeveloped for the value of the property it's on,

175
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,749
and the appearance of Sharks! could have thrust them

176
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,408
into a lot of bureaucratic trouble they weren't expecting

177
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,355
about what exactly their rights to the water are.

178
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:55,451
But who knows?

179
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,943
Well, the Boat Club knows, but they're not saying anything other than

180
00:08:57,944 --> 00:08:59,697
[Islington Boat Club]
Time to go, Sharks!!

181
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:02,583
[Grey]
They must be removed before the end of this month.

182
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,115
Put back into the warehouse,

183
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:07,303
held behind bars of planning permission paperwork,

184
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:12,786
never to see the water again.

185
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:14,626
Although.

186
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,737
There's always that barge.

187
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:21,395
Perhaps, Sharks! could ride again, technically not in the water,

188
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:27,469
but upon it, able to travel up and down London's canals, looking for a new home.

190
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,171
Sharks!
