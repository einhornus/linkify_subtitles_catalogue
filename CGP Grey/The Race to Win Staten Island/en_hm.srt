1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,859
Back in the long, long ago, New York and New Jersey fought over the islands betwixt them.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,579
Were they New York or were they New Jersey?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,118
To determine what was whose, New York proposed a race!

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,159
All islands that could be encircled in less than 24 hours would belong to New York.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,839
Those not, to New Jersey.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,459
Staten Island was the big prize -- then described as "the most commodiousest and richest land".

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,679
New Jersey wanted it and given the island is huge and back-in-the-day boats were slow,…

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,419
…New Jersey thought the island impossible to encircle in under a day, and so it would be hers.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,478
But young New York, determined to expand her empire state, thought she had the man for the job.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,119
Captain Christopher Billopp.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,259
The clever captain, lashed empty barrels to his ship, to help catch the wind and make haste,…

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,499
…and ‘twas this that made the difference, winning the race against time, …

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,359
…and encircling the most commodiousest island of Staten for New York in just over twenty three hours.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,999
This delightful deed earned Billopp historical immortality in books and articles and on Wikipedia …

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,759
… and the embiggened New York gifted the captain an estate, on Staten Island of course, …

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,819
… that still stands today, a historical museum and park for the local Staten Island Yorkers that, ...

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,059
… were it not for Billopp, would find themselves Jerseyites instead.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,479
What a cute story!

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,119
So *perfect* for the video about New York and New Jersey's border disputes I'm working on.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,359
But wait, was the 24 hour race around *each island individually* or *all islands at once*?

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,859
This wording isn't clear.

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,679
Might as well ask the museum about the route.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,019
I’ve always found that hometown historians happily honor hometown heroes.

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,639
Well, no reason to just sit around, let's follow the footnote trail.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,379
New York Times, 1913.

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,919
[microfilm fed to microfilm reader / mouse clicking]

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,219
Ok, Billopp gets inspired to put the barrels on his ship.

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,799
There's great suspense as people await their resident state fate…

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,259
… and Billopp took “a little over twenty three hours” to complete his journey.

30
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,799
That's less than helpful and it's a newspaper: no sources are listed, just the journalist’s name.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,559
But she did write a book six years later containing much the same story.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,219
(though the onlookers go from suspense to *throbbing suspense*)

33
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,979
And, unlike a newspaper, there is a Bibliography (yay!) but it's not broken down by chapter (boo!).

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,039
I really don't want to go through this. Please tell me the museum wrote back.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,899
Hmmmm

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,699
Wait a minute: More than two hundred years ago?

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,559
The article says almost three hundred years ago.

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,499
That’s nearly a hundred years apart. When did this race even happen?

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,939
Almost three hundred years ago from 1913 would be 1620-ish.

40
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,579
But New Jersey only became New Jersey in 1664 via a royal charter.

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,399
Which… does that thing even mention Billopp?

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,099
Why do so many organizations put up these tiny, unreadable gif versions of their *founding documents*?

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,899
Then there's no mention of Billopp, or even Staten Island, so the race had to happen *after* the charter.

44
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,459
Which means it's no more than 249 years before this article. That's the *oldest* a source could be.

45
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,559
What's the *youngest* reliable source that might mention the race?

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,299
Well, the Supreme Court dealt with New York and New Jersey island ownership in the 90s.

47
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,579
Does that mention Billopp?

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:03:02,699

(Grey)
What was I doing?? Oh right…

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,159
Nothing about Billopp here, but they do mention another 1880s Supreme Court situation.

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,199
But that also makes no mention of Billopp.

59
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,039
Meanwhile the museum *still* hasn't gotten back and I'm getting suspicious they’re avoiding me.

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,479
But there is a history section on the site, saying the house was built about 1680, …

61
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,739
… and Christoper Billopp was a filthy royal loyal …

62
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,999
…. and his home the site of a failed peace talk …

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,859
… between the righteous revolutionaries and the conquerous crown.

64
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,939
A traitor for the video! Sweet.

65
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,919
Wait, that's a hundred years apart again…

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,779
Oh, damn it!  There's two of them!

67
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,039
Captain Christoper Billopp (two l's, two p's)

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,579
and Colonel Christoper Billop (two l's, one p)

69
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,539
The later the great grandson of the former.

70
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,859
Both living on Billopp Manor, Staten Island.

71
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,579
This has caused much confusion….

72
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:22,339
But Billopp the Captain died in 1726, so the race had to happen between 1664 and then.

73
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,099
Ok, I give up. Let's dive into this.

74
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,719
NOTHING IS CONSISTENT!

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,339
Look, look: on Wikipedia and in the New York Times, the race took a little over 23 hours.

76
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,439
But The Staten Islander, 1911, says the race took exactly 23 hours and 37 minutes.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,279
Where did that come from??

78
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,019
And the ship.

79
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,059
Sometimes she’s an Atlantic-crossing vessel with cannons.

80
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,539
And sometimes she's Billopp's personal plucky boat.

81
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,419
Or the manor.

82
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,459
In the earliest versions of the story, Billopp already lived on the manor.

83
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,839
But in later versions, it was a prize for his victory.

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,859
Or the barrels. *The barrels*!!

85
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,579
In A History of Thomas and Anne Billopp Farmar and Some of their Descendants (1907), …

86
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,759
… there's this paragraph about the exact location where Billopp billowed the barrels.

87
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,259
But that detail is nowhere else ever mentioned. Just here.

88
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,219
But in the earlier Morris's Memorial History of Staten Island (1898) …

89
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,259
“It is said that he covered the deck of his vessels with empty barrels, thus gaining considerable sailing power.”

90
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,799
The "it" in “it is said”…

91
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,259
(a weaselly phrase if there ever was one)

92
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,379
… is J. J. Clute, who wrote The Annals of Staten Island twenty years earlier, …

93
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,039
… telling the tale with no barrels a'tall.

94
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,319
And Clute starts his ‘history' book saying he spoke to a bunch of old-timers …

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,419
… right before they died and got stories out of them, …

96
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,039
… to add to The Forest of All Knowledge, that otherwise would have been lost.

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,699
Which is a polite way of saying: “This is oral history."

98
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,939
Which is a polite way of saying: “This is hearsay."

99
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,659
Which means: “This is a hear story.”

100
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,059
Which means: “This isn't history.”

101
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,459
And so it is revealed.

102
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,919
The tale of the race is cute and perfect because it's a Lady Godiva story.

103
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,239
(told long after it supposedly happened)

104
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,919
And survived the centuries by being clever and cute.

105
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,499
And evolving to be clever-er and cuter-er as it passed along.

106
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,299
It’s Ye Old Meme.

107

[Grey sighing]

108
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,619
So much time wasted… chasing ghosts.

109
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,759
Time to fix the record and time to let this go.

110
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,959
[tapping fingers on desk]

111
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,859
But… whose ghost?

112
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,139
Tall tales take tellers.

113
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,159
Who told this story for the first time?

114
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,619
Reaching across the centuries to steal hours from my life, for the lulz?

115
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,139
OK. I've picked up a trial that predates J.J. Clute.

116
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,019
There's a New York Evening Post article from 1873…

117
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,319
(with the race, without the barrels, and where Billopp already owned the land, by the way)

118
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,099
… that lists the prime culprit: Reverend Disosway.

119
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,699
The 'local chronicler' who told the story.

120
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,199
I’m pinning him as the old-timer Clute spoke to for his book that got the story going.

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,399
There’s references to Disosway writing articles for The Richmond County Gazette …

122
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,479
… about this race that never happened.

123
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,999
And Staten Island’s Historical Archives have digitized *hundreds* of volumes.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,719
But having gone through *them all*, there’s no articles by Disosway.

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,339
But there are some missing volumes.

126
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,059
Now, look.

127
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,999
I don't want to get all conspiratorial here…

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,339
About a History Museum that never wrote back.

129
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,339
Or a Staten Island Historical Archive that just so happens to be missing the couple parts I’m looking for.

130
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,179
But I’m in… so deep now.

131
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,639
I’ve tracked down the only place on earth with surviving physical copies…

132
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,459
… of the Richmond County Gazette.

133
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,379
The New York Public Library.

134
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,259
Who just so happens to also list the vital volumes as missing.

135
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,199
But are they really?!

136
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,039
Perhaps, somewhere in their archive of old and rare books are the missing editions.

137
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,419
But alas, I live thousands of miles away.

138
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,639
The trail ran cold, but I have the culprit’s name.

139
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,619
Disosway (1798 to 1868) is the first tall tale teller.

140
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,639
But the first written records are lost to history.

141
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,639
Time to let it go.

[traffic noises]

146
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,159
I couldn't let it go.

147
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,179
I came to the New York Public Library to see for myself that Disosway's first story…

148
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,919
… about Billopp in the Richmond County Gazette really is missing.

149
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:12,339
[loud foot steps on the marble stairs]

150
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,199
Ohhhhh… This is it. The last place with answers.

151
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,519
The Rare Book Room.

[Grey knocking on door]

153
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,759
(Grey, whispering loudly)
It's really over now.

154
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,599
I tried to talk the librarians into letting me into their rare books crypt.

155
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,319
And, to my great surprise, they said… “No.”

156
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,239
(librarian)
Shhhh!!

157
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,139
(Grey, to librarian)
Sorry.

158
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,298
(Grey, whispering more quietly)
But I did get to talk to someone who might just be the world's expert on the The Gazette…

159
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,579
… and confirmed to me (quite firmly) that the lost volumes really are lost.

160
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,199
So…this is it. The end of the footnote trail. There’s nowhere left to go.

00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,859
… and talk to the historians who never got back to me.

165
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:12,819
(chuckling)
Ignore my emails? I might just show up!

166
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,819
You've got to be kidding me. They closed it!

167
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,359
I came all this way and they closed it?!?!

168
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,079
[Grey chuckling turns into crazed laughter]

169
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,139
Well… at least I know the building is real.

170
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,259
Though when and why it was built isn’t exactly nailed down.

171
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,239
And… as far and I can know…

172
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,499
Captain and Colonel Christopher Billops were real people, …

173
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,199
… connected to the founding and freedom of the country.

174
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,879
And these hooks on reality probably helped Disosway’s tale survive over the centuries.

175
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,639
From his mouth to Clute's ear and book, onward to others.

176
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,399
And eventually the New York Times, to be sourced in the Wikipedia, …

177
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,899
… to be found (I wish it had never happened) by me.

178
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,559
But here, on the southern tip of Staten Island, …

179
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,299
… alone and locked out of Billopp's house, it’s really the end of the story.

180
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:08,039
Nothing else waits on this island for me, but ghosts and graves.

181
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,959
Oh!!

182
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,899
Where is it??

183
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,499
[loud thunder crashes over rain sounds]

184
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,999
I know you’re here somewhere!

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:26,759
[rumbling thunder and rain sounds]

186
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:36,539
[softer rain sounds]

187
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,219
Ahh, hahaha. Oh, it’s amazing!

188
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,360
[soft thunder dying out]
