Hello Internet.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,119
While working on a future video, I offhandedly wrote, “Venus, the closest planet to Earth.”

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,539
But later, while editing, I thought, “You know, let me check that.”

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,199
Which led to me to this video by Dr. Stockman explaining how, no, Venus is not the closest.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,239
This blew my mind and I contacted the author to adapt his video into the one you probably just watched.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,559
It blew my mind, not just because it was surprising,

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,079
but also because I taught physics for years and probably said

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,119
“Venus is the closest planet” dozens of times without ever thinking about it.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,359
How does that happen?

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,759
First, asking the precisely right question is vital.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,759
"Which planet is closest?" is *not* the precisely right question.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,839
Because it’s really made of four parts:

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,919
Which planet ever gets the closest?

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,719
Which planet is the closest for the longest time?

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,359
Which planet has the shortest average distance to Earth?

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,759
Which planet takes the least amount of time to travel to?

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,599
The answer to the first one is Venus.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,039
The second two?  Mercury.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,039
The last?  It's complicated, get a physics degree.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,319
Literal rocket scientists think mostly about that last question

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,399
and the rest of us are probably vaguely asking about the first when we say

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,679
"Which is the closest?" because we're not thinking about the planets in motion.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,519
If we were, we'd ask something closer to questions two and three,

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,279
which is what the main video is about.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,759
Mercury, on average, has the shortest distance to all the other planets,

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,959
and for the inner planets, it’s also the closest planet most of the time.

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
But to get an answer that precise requires a precise question.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,519
Unlike the way things are done in school, where questions yield knowledge,

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,999
it's knowledge that yields questions, which yield knowledge.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,759
Now, it's hard to think about the raw knowledge of everything all at once,

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,239
so we condense down part of what we know into a model to help us think,

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,119
like with the line of the planets.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,439
But, as with fuzzy questions, models can trick us too:

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,959
“Which planet is the closest?” looks like a simple and easy question

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,799
when the solar system is shown this way.

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,319
Like even when you know that isn't *really* how the Solar System looks.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,759
Can't possibly be.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,159
In my old video about Pluto

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,199
(where I sound like a completely different person)

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,638
I covered this exact point as I've often done in class:

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,918
(past Grey)
"If we take this diagram

42
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,799
“and adjust for the correct sizes of the planets, it looks like this.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,479
“Think about it.

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,599
“If Jupiter was this close to Earth, it wouldn’t look like a dot in the night sky,

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,119
but would be rather overwhelming.  So it must be really far away.“

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,119
(present-day Grey)
Still, the model gets into your head in ways you don't notice

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,639
and lets you ask imprecise questions, easily, but insufficiently answered.

48
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,719
The result is something that's retroactively obvious can hide for a long time.

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,479
The fact about Mercury being the closest on average feels like something Newton could have noticed.

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,279
But it wasn't published until *this year*.

51
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,799
Which is crazy.  It's a property of concentric circles.

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,039
(Something Pythagoras, were he not so obsessed with triangles, might have noticed.)

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,239
So, I love this fact about Mercury being the closest planet,

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,319
(depending on exactly what you mean by closest)

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,599
because it’s a fantastic example of how if you can get rid of old or incorrect models

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,839
from you head and think clearly in a way to ask a precise question,

57
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,759
the universe awaits with new knowledge for you to find.

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,519
Isn't that great?
