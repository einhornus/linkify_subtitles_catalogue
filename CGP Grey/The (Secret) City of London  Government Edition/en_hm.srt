1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:05,889
The City of London is a unique place -- it's
the city in a city (in a country in a country)

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,759
that runs its government with perhaps the
most complicated elections in the world involving

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,899
medieval guilds, modern corporations, mandatory
titles and fancy hats, all of which are connected

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,419
in this horrifying org chart.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,499
Why so complicated?

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,689
Though the new Skyscrapers might make you
think the City of London is relatively young,

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,529
it's actually the oldest continuous government
on the Island of Great Britain.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,239
The City of London predates the Empire that
Victoria ruled, the Kingdoms Anne united and

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,158
the Magna Carta that John, reluctantly, signed.

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,479
While the London which surrounds the city
only got to electing its first Mayor in 2000,

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,459
the list of Mayors who've governed the City
of London is almost 700 people long going

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,738
back more than a thousand years.

13
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:50,639
The City of London's government is so old
there's no surviving record of when it was

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,898
born -- there are only documents, like the
Magna Carta, which mention the pre-existing

15
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,058
powers the City of London already had at that
time.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,889
While a government like the United States's
officially gets its power from the people,

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,969
and Parliament gets its power from the Crown,
(which in turn gets it from God), the City

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:14,059
of London gets its power from 'time immemorial'
meaning that the City is so old, it just is.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,099
And that age brings with it unusual and complicated
traditions, the most notable of these, perhaps,

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,968
is that in city of London elections, companies
get votes.

21
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:27,599
Quite a lot actually, about 3/4th of the votes
cast in City elections are from companies

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,949
with the remaining 1/4th from residents.

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,449
The way it works is that the bigger a company
is the more votes it gets from the City of

24
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,449
London.

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,149
The companies then give their votes to select
employees who work, but do not live, within

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,809
the city and it's these employees who do the
actual voting at election time.

27
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,569
The result is that the Common Council, the
bureaucratic beating heart of the City of

28
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,069
London, has about 20 common councilors elected
by residents of the city and about 80 elected

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,639
by companies of the city.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,188
The reasoning behind this unusual tradition
is that for every 1 person who lives in the

31
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,718
City of London, 43 people commute in every
day.

32
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:07,709
In total that's 300,000 commuters using City
services and whose employment depends on the

33
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,219
City of London being business friendly.

34
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,549
The man in charge of the common council and
who heads The City's government is The Right

35
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,889
Honorable, the Lord Mayor of London.

36
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,359
Now, suppose *you* want to be Lord Mayor,

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,749
Surely, just as in that other London all you'll
need do is

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,889
a) Be a British, Commonwealth, or EU citizen,
who has

39
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,110
b) lived in the city for a year, and who

40
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:28,639
c) wins the election

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,639
Right?

42
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,309
No, in The City of London, that's not nearly
enough.

43
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,249
Ready for the qualifications list?

44
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,719
Before you even run for Lord Mayor you need
have been a Sheriff of The City of London.

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,969
But before you can be Sheriff, you need to
be an Aldermen.

46
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,969
What's an Aldermen?

47
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,489
Well, the City of London is divided into 25
wards, and each Ward elects one Aldermen to

48
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,199
represent it on the Court of Aldermen -- a
sub-section of the common council.

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,199
Before you can run for Alderman, you need
to gain Freeman Status... and who gives out

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,299
freeman status?

51
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,909
Why none other than the very Court of Aldermen
you're trying to get elected to.

52
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,879
Which might just seem like a conflict of interest.

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,119
Luckily there is another way to get the freeman
status -- join one of the City's Guilds -- sadly,

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,699
they aren't called guilds, they're called
Livery Companies (a name which is both more

55
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,449
boring and less descriptive), but the remnants
of medieval guilds many of them are and within

56
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,819
the City there are 108 of them to choose from
including, but not limited to,

57
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,819
The Apothecaries

58
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,819
The Fishmongers

59
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,819
The Masons

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,819
The Mercers

61
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,819
The Scientific Instrument Makers

62
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,819
The Bankers

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,819
The Shipwrights

64
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,819
The Wheelwrights

65
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,819
The Butchers,

66
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,819
The bakers,

67
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,819
*Two* different candlestick makers,

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,819
and the most exciting of all: The Chartered
Accountants!

69
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,399
Many of these guilds, like the Fletchers,
have become charities, but some are still

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,479
active, such as the Goldsmiths who test the
quality of British coinage and the Hackney

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,119
carriage drivers who license taxi drivers.

72
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,209
To join one of these guilds you'll either
need to meet the professional requirements,

73
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,939
or for the charities like the Haberdashers
you'll need the approval of two existing members,

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,939
others won't tell you how to become a members.

75
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,289
If, you meet none of the Livery Companies
membership requirements, but you think you'll

76
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,729
be a clever clogs and start your *own* Livery
Company and grant *yourself* freeman status,

77
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,039
tough luck because new Livery Companies need
to be approved by, you guessed it, the Court

78
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,039
of Aldermen.

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,149
But let's assume one way or another you get
the official freeman status certificate, now

80
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,669
you can finally run for Aldermen of a Ward
-- after the Lord Chancellorâ€™s Advisory

81
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,398
Committee also approves of you.

82
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,189
But, that small barrier passed, you can win
election as Aldermen in either one of the

83
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,429
4 wards where people live or the 21 wards
where companies live.

84
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,209
Once on the court of aldermen to continue
your path to the Mayor's Office in Guildhall,

85
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,219
you must now be elected as sheriff, but this
time it's the members of the Livery Companies

86
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,499
who pick the sheriffs.

87
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,289
So *if* the Livery Company members elect you
as Sheriff, *after* you have successfully

88
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,589
completed your term *then* you can finally
run for Mayor.

89
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,559
But, surprisingly the, residents of the City
of London don't vote for the Mayor, our old

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,839
friends on the Court of Aldermen do.

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,009
So in summary, once you get freeman status
from either the court of aldermen or the livery

92
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,759
companies and after your ward elected you
as alderman and then the livery companies

93
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,839
elect you as sheriff and after your term as
sheriff ends but while you're still on the

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,749
court of aldermen then you can run for Mayor.

95
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,249
And -- assuming the other aldermen select
you, finally take your place as **The Right

96
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,069
Honorable, The Lord Mayor of London** -- for
one year, with no salary.

97
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,039
And you have to cover your own expenses, which
will be quite considerable as your new job

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,179
consists mostly of making hundreds of speeches
a year around the world promoting city business.

99
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,960
But you do get that fancy hat, which just
might make it all worth while.
