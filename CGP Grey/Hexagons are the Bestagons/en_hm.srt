00:00:00,000 --> -1:59:59,999
[playful instrumental synth music fades slowly]
You know...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,959
You know...

3
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,751
Hexagons are the bestagons.

4
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:04,428
Why?

5
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:05,722
Because bees.

6
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:06,835
Bees are the best

7
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:09,300
and build only the bestagon, the hexagon.

8
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,529
Now, I know what you’re thinking.

9
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,939
Bees build hexagons because they're hexapods

10
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,129
with hexagon eyes.

11
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,759
How could they do otherwise?

12
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,709
Excellent point.

13
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,819
But the humble bumble has an engineering problem to solve.

14
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,159
She makes two things: honey and wax.

15
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,169
The former to eat,

16
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,029
and the latter to contain the former.

17
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,459
To make but a little honey,

18
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,569
she must visit a lot of flowers.

19
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,149
And to make one unit of wax,

20
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,769
she needs eight units of honey.

21
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,859
Wax is costly for bees in flower terms,

22
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,859
and honey is drippy in food terms,

23
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,299
so to make a hive that contains the maximum honey

24
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,319
while using the minimum wax is royally vital.

25
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,159
Thus, a honeycomb conjecture.

26
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,769
Which shape works best?

27
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,469
To answer, we need to talk tiles.

28
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,439
Tiling is covering a surface with a pattern of polygons.

29
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,579
There's lots of options

30
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,219
because there's lots of polygons.

31
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,519
Even the regulars go on and on-agon.

32
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,919
Now for bees picking patterns,

33
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,069
the more complicated ones

34
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,509
obviously use more lines than necessary.

35
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,159
That’s what complicated means.

36
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,879
And thus a honeycomb of that tile

37
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,699
would use more wax per honey.

38
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,159
So sticking to the simple regulars,

39
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,239
there are just three that tile tightly.

40
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,849
Triangle, square, and hexagon.

41
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,259
Pentagons are broken hexagons leaving gaps.

42
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,399
Same with septagons.

43
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,549
Octagons are alright,

44
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,829
but they're no hexagon.

45
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,479
Which leaves the tiling trio which tile differently.

46
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,189
A square is a square of squares,

47
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,189
which is a square of squares, and so on.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,419
Squares tile tidily by basically cheating.

49
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,029
Covering an infinite plane with an

50
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,029
infinite number of parallel lines.

51
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,809
Like, wow, that's what a plane is.

52
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,749
Boring!

53
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,179
Triangles pull the same trick,

54
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,549
dividing themselves down into infinite nothing.

55
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,999
But not the hexagon!

56
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,529
The only regular polygon

57
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,019
to tile a plane without resorting to debasing self-division,

58
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,789
unlike some squares I could mention.

59
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,209
At least triangle is trying to be

60
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,209
more geometrically interesting than square,

61
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,339
teaming up a bit to…

62
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,809
one, two, three, four, five, six.

63
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,689
Wait, hexagon!

64
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,019
The other shapes can't help it.

65
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,109
They just want to be the bestagon.

66
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,299
Even some of the irregulars,

67
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,139
like rhombus, tile by hexagoning.

68
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,679
Same with your triakis tilis,

69
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,289
[with difficulty]
and deltoidal trihexagonals,

70
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,329
[with continued difficulty]
and your, ah, kisrhombille,

71
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,609
[with laughter]
and floret pentagonals.

72
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,979
Look, they're all just hexagons.

73
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,159
Even Cairo tiles

74
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,149
(poor pentagons)

75
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,259
tile up as best they can to form a lumpy hexagon.

76
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,029
The rest just can't compete with the best.

77
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,839
The hexagon,

78
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,409
nobly indivisible,

79
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,789
is the bestagon.

80
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,029
Uhh, where were we?

81
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,269
Oh right, honeycomb conjecture.

82
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,479
Max honey.  Min wax.  Three options.

83
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,479
Okay yes there's the circle.

84
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,289
A shape defined by the least perimeter for the most area,

85
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,199
but that only works when you need just one.

86
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,779
Pack circles and this is the best they can do.

87
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,199
Look at all that wasted space!

88
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,499
And even if you pack the gaps,

89
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,969
you still use more wax.

90
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,319
And, again, the way these circles,

91
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,299
arrange themselves …

92
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,039
it's almost like… 

93
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,009
onetwothreefourfivesix 

94
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,969
hidden hexagon!

95
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,389
Bees use the hexagon

96
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,209
because no shape is better to create

97
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,689
the maximum area for the minimum wall.

98
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,689
And this min-max stat of hexagon

99
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,689
is one of the many reason they show up everywhere.

100
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,329
Including in the aforementioned bee's eyes.

101
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,649
Each hexagon is a long tube that leads

102
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,499
to the light-catching cells at the bottom.

103
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,119
More light equals better vision and

104
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,289
hexagons let the most light in

105
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,319
using the least amount of wall.

106
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,599
So why aren't your eyes hexagons?

107
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,769
Au contraire mon ami,

108
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,259
they are l'Hexagone.

109
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,089
[intensely]
Not on the outside, but on the inside.

110
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,929
Your light-catching cells are at the back of your eye,

111
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,909
in a hexagonal grid for the same reason as bees.

112
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,529
Max light, min wall.

113
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,039
Your window to the world,

114
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,719
is but through the hexagon.

115
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,719
Does that not make it the bestagon?

116
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,589
Okay, maybe hexagon as min-max-agon

117
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,869
doesn't catch your fancy.

118
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,669
Then how about a little mystery, oui?

119
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,509
Let us travel to Saturn.

120
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,459
Yes, the rings are attention-grabbing,

121
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,739
but leave the equator,

122
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,529
travel north and here lies the unexplained.

123
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,529
The Great Hexagon of Saturn.

124
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,579
Need something for scale?

125
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,959
Well, here's the Earth.

126
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,189
Oh, here's six the Earths.

127
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,719
Saturn's hexagon is pretty big.

128
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,589
What is it?

129
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,249
Well, you might be thinking it's a geological formation.

130
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,979
An enormous basalt column

131
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,189
like the smaller versions you find on Earth.

132
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,769
But no.

133
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,069
Saturn is a gas giant.

134
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,699
There is no surface or geology to speak of.

135
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,299
So the great hexagon is composed of shapeless clouds

136
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,219
somehow keeping shape and changing color.

137
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,829
It's a magnificent solar system mystery.

138
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,829
And, while I'm no space archeologist,

139
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,809
if I was looking for an alien-gifted monolith,

140
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,549
on the most “look at me” planet,

141
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,768
under a hexagon beacon with earth-sized sides,

142
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,249
[tongue click]
that's where I would start.

143
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,659
After all, what aliens would want to make

144
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,909
first contact with the nearby monkeys

145
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,729
before they became enlightened

146
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,729
to pursue the universal truth.

147
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,799
Hexagon is the bestagon.

148
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,529
From the largest down to the smallest.

149
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,359
Say, for example, this tiny snowflake I happen to have,

150
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,199
that has six sides, as all snowflakes do.

151
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,719
Gee, what could cause that to be?

152
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,209
Let's zoom down to the atomic realm and see.

153
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,689
When water molecules join together to make a flake,

154
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,239
the sturdy shape they prefer is the hexagon.

155
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,649
As more molecules join,

156
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,419
they extend the flake fractally up.

157
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,809
The beauty of the snowflake on the monkey scale,

158
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,559
is but an extension of  the hexagonal perfection

159
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,819
on the atomic scale.

160
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,729
Okay, yes*.*

161
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,059
You will sometimes find snowflakes with twelve sides,

162
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,649
but this happens when two growing snowflakes

163
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,429
get stuck together, so it still counts.

164
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,429
And the hexagon isn't just for snow,

165
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,069
but for all ice 1H,

166
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,229
which means basically all ice on earth.

167
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,699
Yeah, there's a little ice 1C

168
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,599
which we don't talk about

169
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,819
because it's made of cubes,

170
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,069
and cubes are boring. 

171
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,429
And there's a bit of ice 9.

172
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,179
No, don't touch that.

173
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,629
But if there is ice in your drink,

174
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,219
give thanks to the hexagon for keeping it cool.

175
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,279
And it's not just water.

176
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,479
Lots of atoms use hexagons because…

177
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,359
(take a note)

178
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,359
hexagons are the bestagons.

179
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,659
Oh, using a pencil?

180
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,659
Get ready to have your mind blown

181
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,439
about the hexagon here too.

182
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,339
The lead.

183
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,339
Well, it isn't lead lead, it's carbon.

184
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,799
And you know what carbon atoms think is the bestagon?

185
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,309
[snap]
The hexagon.

186
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,159
Pencil graphite is a whole bunch of hexagonal carbons,

187
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,159
and when they happen to be in a straight sheet,

188
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,239
that's graphene,

189
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,259
which happens to be the strongest

190
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,599
atomic material in the universe.

191
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,379
Some of which is in that pencil.

192
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,939
To tear a sheet of graphene apart,

193
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,189
you would need a hundred times more force

194
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,699
than to do so with steel.

195
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,629
Hexagon is strong-a-gon.

196
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,579
This is because when hexagons come together,

197
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,769
they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart.

198
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,329
This, for the least material,

199
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,729
is the most mechanically stable arrangement.

200
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,659
Pull on one joint,

201
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,499
and the other two equally pull back,

202
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,079
push in, and the other two are the

203
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,079
most able and stable to resist.

204
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,079
Now look anew at a tiling of hexagons

205
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,839
and you see it is composed of nothing

206
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,289
but these max stable joints,

207
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,659
each arranged perfectly to help the others

208
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,119
be stronger and stabler.

209
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,419
This is another reason hexagons show up everywhere.

210
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,609
The universe blesses stability in her physics,

211
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,209
from those basalt columns,

212
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,149
to bubbles which,

213
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,149
as soon as they can,

214
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,079
ditch their spheres to become

215
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,879
as close to hexagonal perfection as they can.

216
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,949
That's so cool.

217
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,559
Oh right, yes.

218
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,239
So if your pencil lead contains

219
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,639
some of the strongest material in the universe

220
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,699
how can you write with it?

221
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,429
Okay, okay.

222
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,009
This is going to get even more exciting.

223
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,289
While hexagons are super strong this way,

224
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,189
they aren't super strong this way.

225
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,039
On a small scale,

226
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,719
that means your pencil can break off

227
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,189
in layers to leave a mark.

228
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,299
But on a big scale,

229
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,589
hexagons can be flexible while keeping their strength,

230
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,679
letting us construct some totally unreal materials.

231
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,789
Print out a grid of hexagons in whatever,

232
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,969
from aluminum to cardboard,

233
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,969
make a little sandwich,

234
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,749
and pow!

235
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,229
You've got honeycomb paneling.

236
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,759
A ridonkulously tear-resistant material

237
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,969
that's also super light and flexible.

238
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,419
It's used everywhere 

239
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,309
but particularly in aviation.

240
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,309
Rockets need to be strong yet light.

241
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,479
Same for aircraft.

242
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,479
With wings that really can't tear

243
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,979
but also need to bend.

244
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,109
And only the magic of the honeycomb panel

245
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,429
can do both as well.

246
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,179
Give thanks to the hexagon for blessing our flight.

247
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,049
And we still haven't yet discussed

248
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,829
the most important application of the hexagon.

249
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,539
Games!

250
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,919
For centuries there has been great debate over boards,

251
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,769
squares or hexagons?

252
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,209
Spoiler... hexagons win.

253
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,609
Square boards are the first thing

254
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,609
an unenlightened species would think of.

255
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,189
They look sensible and are easy to implement,

256
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,269
but they are terrible,

257
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,889
ineffective boards that cause spatial suffering.

258
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,609
On a square board move horizontal

259
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,669
or vertical one space

260
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,419
and you've moved one space,

261
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,759
but move diagonal

262
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,319
and the distance is the square root of two spaces.

263
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,139
Gross.

264
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,629
Diagonals warp the distance pieces move.

265
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,699
Square boards look even and tidy,

266
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,529
but it's deceit.

267
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,049
Their diagonals corrupting the meaning of space and time,

268
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,489
and of course they must,

269
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,639
because a square only has four true neighbors.

270
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,439
Hexagons, however, have six

271
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,619
which is more than four,

272
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,279
which is better!

273
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,479
And the distance from one space to the next

274
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,199
is the same in every direction.

275
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,249
One space.

276
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,569
Just as it should be.

277
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,029
If you're a game based on squares,

278
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,019
I'm so sorry.

279
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,359
But there is hope.

280
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,539
With thought and effort,

281
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,548
you can hexagon yourself into a better place.

282
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,428
As we all should aspire to do,

283
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,069
spreading order and hexagonal enlightenment

284
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,729
for, hexagons are the bestagons.

285
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,369
And now that you agree, with your eyes will see

286
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,949
their six-sided perfection in all things.

287
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,559
And you will say to yourself,

288
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,839
as part of the order

289
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,399
hexagons are the bestagons.

290
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,149
Uhh, thanks for stopping by for communicator coffee.

291
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,979
Now, go.  Share the enlightenment of the order with others.
