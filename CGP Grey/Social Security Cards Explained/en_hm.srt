1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,019
Americans love their independence...

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,279
a nation of pioneers living out from under the eye of government ...

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,679
(except for all the government).

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,679
As such, unlike many other countries, Americans don't have a national ID card...

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,499
...and even the idea of creating one is a political hot topic every election cycle.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,619
The results are always the same: we don't need no ID card.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,739
But suspiciously, US citizens do already have this:

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,419
a card with a unique number that many places will ask for to prove who you are.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,199
This is the Social Security card and number...

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,079
...and it has become a quasi ID / unique password to identify citizens...

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,439
...though that was never its intended use.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,519
For Americans, keeping this number secret is super important...

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,959
because it's the key to the government and banks to identifying you as you...

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,199
… and losing control of it is the worst kind of identity theft that can happen.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,859
So how did Americans end up with a national ID number…

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,399
… that isn't one and a card terribly unfit to identify?

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,219
It all started in the great depression of long long ago…

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,479
… when the government created the social security program, …

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,199
… a kind of mandatory pension:

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,518
Citizens would be required to pay in during…

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,839
… their working lives and withdraw in their retirement.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,319
The idea being that even if past-you didn't save…

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,999
… for the sunset years of future-you, the eventually old current you…

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,899
… would still have something to live on.

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,239
Now if you want to think of social security as a benefit…

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,659
… the government provides or as a bank account that's yours …

27
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,579
… is… controversial, but either way this number was created …

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,119
… to track what you put in and what you take out.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,664
Now, because this was just one government program…

30
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:31,719
related only to your working life, you only needed to apply…

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,699
…for a social security card when you actually started working.

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,899
But over time, that changed and the younger you are,

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,119
…the more likely you've had one from the moment of your birth…

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,499
…despite babies' worthlessness as child laborers.

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,419
So why?

36
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,719
Well it goes back to Americans' having no national identity card…

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,559
…with a national number, which makes it harder for institutions…

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,899
… to keep track of people over their lives.

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,679
With hundreds of millions of citizens,

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,439
names and birthdays aren't unique,

41
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,079
people move, people marry, people change names.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,299
And if you're trying to keep track of everyone,

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,659
as say the United States Tax department might want to do,

44
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,619
it can be a real problem, particularly in the pre-computer days.

45
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,159
"Hey, wait a minute, look, at *this* number just lying around,"

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,699
the tax department said.

47
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,539
"It's not supposed to be used as an ID number,"

48
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,719
said the social security department.

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,999
"There are security reasons you shouldn't--"

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,499
"Yoink!"

51
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,659
Thus the tax department piggy-backed off of the work

52
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,979
the social security department did assigning working adults a number,

53
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,139
which made tracking taxes easier

54
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,119
… and they highly encouraged parents to get a social security number…

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,399
… for their children by tying it to a tax discount.

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,759
Crazily, counting children for tax rebates used to run on the honor system.

57
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,219
The US Tax Department told people:

58
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,779
1. We will give you a discount on your taxes for each child you have.  And:

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,219
2. Write down your number of children, …

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,139
…please be honest, we don't have a way to check.

61
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,919
Which was just asking, nay, begging people to lie.

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,899
Which they did, birthing on paper millions of phantom children.

63
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,619
But after requiring each kid to have a social security…

64
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,059
… account number connected to a birth certificate…

65
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,619
… before the parents could get the tax discount, …

66
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,099
… all those phantoms faded away.

67
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,259
This turned the social security number into a unique number…

68
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,799
… that all citizens had right from the start, …

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,499
and that made it easy for lots of other places like banks …

70
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,339
... and schools and companies and landlords …

71
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,779
… to also piggy back on the number as an easy way…

72
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,119
… to keep track of people without having to come up…

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,999
… with their own systems and to be able to exchange information…

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,219
… about people between institutions.

75
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,179
This is super useful for institutions, so, …

76
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,159
…the desire of Americans to not have a national identity card led, …

77
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,359
…somewhat inevitably, …

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,879
…to the nearest thing available being used as a substitute…

79
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,279
… which ended up being worse because the social security number…

80
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,559
… was never designed to be used this way in the long, long ago.

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,179
And you can tell because it has no security built into it.

82
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,559
Ok, so there's this neat trick that most ID numbers use…

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,399
...where they can check themselves to see if they're invalid.

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,479
The simplest way is to have the last couple digits…

85
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,919
… match the sum of the others.

86
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,039
All kinds of ID cards and bar codes do this because it makes it impossible…

87
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,499
… to enter an incorrect number in a computer, …

88
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,339
… and makes it harder for fraudsters to guess valid numbers.

89
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,699
This is why if you try to buy something online by guessing…

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,659
… a credit card number, the website knows it's invalid…

91
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,279
… before you even click buy.

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,759
But because the Social Security number started life…

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,398
… in the long, long ago, it's just a number…

94
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,939
… with no self-checking security built in.

95
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,719
Worse, if you're born pre-2011 it's not that hard to just guess …

96
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,679
…most of the number: the first three digits are the state where the …

97
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,919
parents applied for the card and the last four digits just count up in order, …

98
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,759
… and the middle digits follow a regular pattern.

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,239
So you can take your number, subtract one and that's a valid number…

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,319
… of someone who was probably born in the same hospital…

101
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,239
… as you around the same time.

102
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,059
Thus a fraudster who knows your time and location of birth…

103
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,879
… can probably get the first five digits by just looking them up on a chart.

104
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,539
Institutions ask for the last four digits as a code to identify you as you…

105
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,539
… which means it's not that hard to put together your number…

106
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,759
… from a security leak anywhere or just by connecting a few puzzle pieces.

107
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,599
The physical card itself is no help either:

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,699
… just a literal piece of cardboard, …

109
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,279
… depending on when it was issued, not even laminated.

110
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,959
The social security department used to print…

111
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,099
… 'not to be used for identification' on the cards…

112
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,259
… as a futile attempt to stop institutions for asking for them as IDs, …

113
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,079
…because there's nothing identifying a person on the card.

114
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,439
But eventually they gave up and removed these words…

115
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,539
… because, unlike passports or driver's licenses, …

116
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,139
… you can assume all Americans will have this one card.

117
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,799
All this means your social security card and number…

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,119
… probably have less security than your library card, …

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,559
…while being vastly more important.

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,939
So it fails at being a secure number, …

121
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,159
… it fails at being a good ID card, …

122
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,459
… but at least it is universal* which is why people use it.

123
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,999
Oh hello, asterisk, my old friend.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,899
No, of course not, this program isn't actually universal:

125
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,359
…not everyone has a social security account number, …

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,519
…and not everyone pays into the program.

127
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,439
If you want to get out of paying you'll just need to:

128
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,779
First: Never have received any social security benefits…

129
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,799
… and give up your rights to getting any in the future.

130
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,019
Which seems fair.  In addition you must also:

131
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,739
Be a member of a religion opposed to the idea of social security.

132
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,379
Usually because it’s a kind of insurance, and insurance is a kind of gambling.

133
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,079
That's harder, but you could always just start…

134
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,619
… your own religion if you were really serious about avoiding taxes.

135
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,259
But your new religion must also:

136
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,819
Provide for its elderly and dependent members.

137
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,019
Which means you have to re-create a social security program of sorts …

138
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,759
…in your religion (while also being against social security).

139
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,399
But if creating a contradictory religion doesn't daunt you…

140
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,719
Lastly, it must have existed continuously since 1950.

141
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,499
Which is a giveaway that this exception was written pretty much exclusively…

142
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,919
for the Amish and Mennonites, …

143
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,039
… and kills dead your plans unless you’re willing …

144
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,779
… to undergo a serious change in lifestyle.

145
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,199
It doesn't stop there:

146
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,619
…keep digging and you’ll find all sorts of other weird, weird exceptions:

147
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,819
… including some railroad workers, or firefighters, or police, …

148
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,479
… or teachers (but only in Chicago).

149
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,979
Usually these are groups that in the long long ago…

150
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,319
… were able to get out of the program at its creation date.

151
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,399
So nothing's ever straight forward.

152
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,199
And that's the deal with this social security card:

153
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,939
… containing a national number for citizens that don't want one, …

154
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,719
… on an identification card, that fails at identification, …

155
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,999
… given to all citizens -- except when it isn't -- …

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,820
…for a program that's universal, except when it's not.
