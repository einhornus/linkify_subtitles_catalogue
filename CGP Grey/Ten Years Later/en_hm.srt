[patriotic instrumental music, Edison Records phonograph cylinder - Rule, Britannia!]

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,959
Hello Internet.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,329
Well, here we are.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,259
One decade later.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,019
Ha!  I wish that was how it worked, but it is not.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,549
No, YouTube still feels like my new job

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,949
even though I've put in almost twice as many YouTube years

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,209
as teaching years at this point.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,799
What can I say?  Brains are weird.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,609
Sure.
[fingers snap]

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,149
Actually, back when I was a teacher,

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,419
I always kept a lava lamp on the desk for students.

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,779
Because when I was a student,

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,449
I always found it easier to listen and to think

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,109
without also having to make eye contact the whole time.

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:47,879
But you'd get chastised for looking up at the ceiling.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,489
Not fun.

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,359
I figured I couldn't be the only one like that,

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,499
so I didn't correct kids for looking away from me,

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,039
but also ceiling gets boring after…

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,279
thirteen years of compulsory schooling.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,259
Thus came onto my desk the endlessly hypnotizing lava lamp as focal point.

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,049
If you're a teacher watching this, give it a try.

24
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,098
It's good for a certain kind of student

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:14,039
and really chills the vibe of the room, man.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,479
Thinking about impact over the long run of human history,

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,519
it's pretty clear that impact tracks with tech and tech with time.

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,889
Ten thousand years ago, there was very little you could do to impact the world.

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,709
So I do expect the next ten years will be more impactful than the last.

30
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,709
And I will bet they're better than the last.

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,869
I'm less confident about that second part than I used to be,

32
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,129
but I still think it holds that, on average,

33
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,669
each decade is an improvement.

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,759
That is, until we accidentally stumble into an existential threat.

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,929
Which is game over.

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,579
Which is pretty... pretty bad.

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,669
If there's anything I've learned from thousands of spoken words,

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,059
it's that human communication is hard.

39
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,879
Way harder than people think.

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,029
Precisely because people think it's easy.

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,269
You just say the words

42
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,459
and the other person hears them and bam!

43
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,259
Understanding!

44
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,359
Alas, no.

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,189
Words are fuzzy things and

46
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,669
you don't realize how poorly you string them together

47
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,869
until you are forced to listen to yourself saying those words.

48
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,069
And even if you're happy with your string of words,

49
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,569
you just don't know how those fuzzy patterns of sound

50
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,719
will pattern match in someone else's brain.

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,939
Human communication is a dance,

52
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,879
and a dance requires partners.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,379
We all create content and I think we should all keep that in mind

54
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:31,489
and be much more willing to work with the intended intention of our interlocutors.

55
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,109
This is my biggest "I liked that band before they were popular" opinion,

56
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,769
but it finally dawned on me recently that Internet culture is the culture now.

57
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,759
Even just two Q & A's ago, I showed the Internet as The Wild West

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,119
but those days are long gone.

59
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,119
thrust aside by content mines or suburbs with homeowner's associations

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,119
fixated on real estate values.

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,189
I think Past-Grey was super naïve to imagine the Internet he loved

62
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:04,679
could possibly both 1) explode in size, and 2) remain the frontier.

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,199
Fantastic!

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,449
I thought that UK video would forever be my albatross, like:

65
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,189
So I was very happy when The Solution to Traffic topped the UK.

66
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,959
And if the day ever comes where something newer beats out Traffic,

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,789
I will be thrilled again.

68
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,409
Not really.

69
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,059
My YouTube colleagues are forever telling me

70
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,289
to be more strategic in the selection of topics.

71
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,119
To target content for growth and views and dolla dolla billz.

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,509
And I know I should but I just kind of can't.

73
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,489
Because the videos take so long from idea to completion,

74
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,289
the only thing that really matters is a topic

75
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,099
that I can stay interested in for months

76
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,939
and that just doesn't work with for me with strategic selection

77
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,309
or trying to have an underlying theme.

78
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,879
But I guess if you're looking for what's similar with all the videos,

79
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,829
one human personality slider is how much you are interested

80
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,369
in things versus how much you are interested in people.

81
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,949
Most people are "people people" but if you look at my videos,

82
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,189
one common connector is the near complete dearth of people.

83
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:08,089
What holds my interest tends to be very thing oriented.

84
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,879
Uhh, I hadn't thought about that possibility until now.

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,829
But if there are people who have watched my videos for the majority of their life,

86
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,359
uhh, say "Hi" in the comments?

87
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,539
Lots of people ask questions about sending letters forward or backward in time.

88
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,079
I wouldn't want to mess with the timeline going backward,

89
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,249
and sending letters forward is boring,

90
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,249
which is why I've never done that sort of thing.

91
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,919
Okay well actuallythatsnottrue, no.

92
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,029
One of my teachers in school had us do this.

93
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,039
To write a letter to ourselves for when we graduated high school and when I got it,

94
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,559
High-School-Me did not care about anything Grade-School-Me had to say.

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,019
And so it goes now.

96
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,129
I'm confident that Ten-Years-From-Now-Me

97
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,719
would be positively meh to get a letter from Current-Me,

98
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,339
in the same way Current-Me couldn't me more meh about

99
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,169
what Ten-Years-Ago-Me thought about anything.

100
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,559
The night time driving that I did in my road trip video!

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,019
I was at that point years out of practice driving.

102
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,679
I hadn't slept well the night before and had already driven all day

103
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,259
and then attempted to tackle both a super fast highway

104
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,979
and then a pretty sketchy road.

105
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,429
Statistically it is without doubt

106
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,129
the most dangerous thing I've done in the last ten years.

107
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:22,619
Even though people watch the video and go,

108
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,699
But the reality of Death is banality.

109
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,269
And it's not always visually obvious when Death is close.

110
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,389
For example, I was on an Indian Reservation for... a project

111
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,009
exploring a canyon and filming.

112
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,879
And it wasn't 'til a few days later, when reviewing the footage,

113
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,209
that I saw the solid ground I was standing on

114
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,099
was actually a bit of an overhang.

115
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,519
It didn't fall, obviously, but it's going to fall at some point,

116
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,089
and had it done so, well, the reservation was off the main path

117
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,879
and the canyon off the path from that,

118
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,569
and the path I was on was off the path in the canyon.

119
00:05:52,570 --> 00:06:01,909
So an untimely crack would doubtlessly have been Game Over.

120
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,559
[flippantly]
¿Por que no los dos?

121
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,069
I feel like that's more for the audience to decide what is,

122
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,039
for them, the blue period of Grey, or whatever.

123
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,599
Because the public perception of creation can often have very little to do

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,879
with the perception or intention of the creator.

125
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,739
Again, human communication is difficult and also art is not the artist.

126
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,269
But for me, there's really only one important era shift

127
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,309
and that's pre-Project Liberty and post-Project Liberty,

128
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,189
which was [wait for it] the Statue of Liberty video.

129
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,949
Which, I think almost no viewer would pick out as a big deal video,

130
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,559
but to me it's the biggest.

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,129
It's the video where I feel like I finally really got my own writing process,

132
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,109
personally accepting its advantages and disadvantages.

133
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,909
That may sound strange because I'd been writing videos for seven years at that point

134
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:54,969
but I think this is just part of what happens when you do something for a long time.

135
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,519
[pensively]
¿Por que no los dos?

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,459
Two clear trend lines: video games up, books down.

137
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,659
I've learned there's a huge number of books I just can't read,

138
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,439
because I'll want to turn them into videos and

139
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,999
I can read books faster than I can make videos,

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,799
so reading those would be just creating a huge pile of guilt for myself.

141
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,179
And, when your job is mostly writing and reading,

142
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,999
it's nice to turn that off and video games are basically

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,299
the only thing in my life that truly shifts my brain into neutral.

144
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,309
All that said, I think the drop in books has gone too far in the last, eh, five years.

145
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,349
I don't like making promises or predictions for my future self,

146
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,579
but one of the things I'd like to be able to say ten years from now

147
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,109
is that I've inflected the reading curve.

148
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,829
The most frightening video I've uploaded this decade was

149
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,849
the one where I asked you to support the channel directly

150
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,619
through membership instead of having sponsors.

151
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,469
Clicking "Upload" that day, I didn't know what would happen.

152
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,039
But I trusted in you and since then, together we have learned

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,379
the trouble with tumbleweed after flying across an ocean,

154
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,859
we've talked like a pirate,

155
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,729
gone through the Tekoi trilogy together,

156
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,259
and, of course, revealed the perfectagon of the hexagon and more.

157
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,429
It is you who let each video flow from start to finish

158
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,129
without me needing to pause and tell you about our sponsor in the middle.

159
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,389
It is you who supports me, my family, and my team.

160
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,919
It's you who allows me to explore the Forest of All Knowledge and share what I've found.

161
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,499
You sponsor my videos.

162
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,689
And thank you.

163
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,609
Thank you for everything, Internet.

164
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,419
Thank you for my whole life.

165
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,599
It's been a wild ten years.

166
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:50,120
