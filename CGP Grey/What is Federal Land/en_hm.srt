1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,639
The United States of America --

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,499
you too Hawaii, and Alaska,

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,879
to scale, for once.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,539
Ever since these states united to create America,

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,199
the federal government of America, …

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,539
… they and she fought mightily over the land --

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,439
-- which plains or forests or mountains or swamps to end up in each hand.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,639
On the map, it looks like states hold all the cards, but they don't.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,379
Just under one third of land in the United States is federal.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,979
But, that’s an average.

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,139
Looking at the percent of Federal Land in the states…

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,959
the 𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟 we go, the 𝑓𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑟 the land, and the less of the state that’s in each state.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,859
There's eastern states with under one percent Federal Land, …

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,939
… and five western states that control less than half of the land 'in their borders.'

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,239
How?  What?

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,939
First thing first: how did this happen?

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,399
America wasn't always the mighty united.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,319
Like us all, she started small, when states were young,

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,759
new, and few, giving away but little for her to play.

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,179
But then America grew:

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,439
Louisiana purchasing, Mexican cessioning,

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,519
and manifest destinying her way across the continent.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,339
But in this age of empires,

24
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,958
it won't do any good to say she owns the land…

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,399
… unless she gets her citizens out there to occupy the vast,

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,279
‘totally unoccupied’ continent.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,699
So America turns from hoarder to minimalist,

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,139
disposing of as much of the land to new states

29
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,799
and new settlers as she can.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,359
Sometimes giving it away in literal races, …

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,039
… where plots of land were drawn,

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,759
homesteaders waited at a starting line, and BANG!

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,379
First family to a plot owns that plot.

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,239
Says who?

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,379
Says America!

36
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,559
She's booting up a private property ladder

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,039
from virgin lands,

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,919
using contracts, and guns.

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,739
10% of all the land in the US was given away for free

40
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,599
just to get people out West.

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,219
See also: railroad companies,

42
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,219
which got the land either side of any track they could build

43
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,839
for the length of a continent.

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,059
If you could live on or improve the land in the 1800s,

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,839
America would probably give it to you.

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,099
But by the 1900s,

47
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,819
most of the states are mostly in place,

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,119
and the Age of Empires and Wagons Westward is over.

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,259
But America still had a ton of land

50
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,479
she didn't or couldn't give away.

51
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,759
And now that the states are settled, well...

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,819
What she has is all she will ever have...

53
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,639
She turns away from her gifting minimalism,

54
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,959
and becomes a curator of her collection of land.

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,999
This change was rather a shock to states

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,099
expecting the land in their borders

57
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,959
would be land in their borders, …

58
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,619
… that Federal Land would continue to be turned over

59
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,239
as it had for a century.

60
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,039
But, no.

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,319
Thus, this map and a lot of angry western states,

62
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,179
now up against a fully operational federal government,

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,279
altering the deal.

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,759
Some states, like poor Utah and Nevada,

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,959
found themselves with hardly any state

66
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,519
in their state or...

67
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,519
... Arizona: “Hey, hey!  What about the reservations?

68
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,399
Are you going to talk about them? ...

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,379
… Are they Federal Land?

70
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,479
Some of us have a lot of reservations in our state.”

71
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,219
CGP Grey: “Ahhh, the reservations.

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,079
Yes, what a great story for another time…

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,739
… Look, we can't do the reservations right now, we just can't!”

74
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,139
Okay, history aside, America has all this land now,

75
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,679
but like, what is it for?

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,159
What is it for? A lot.

77
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,219
Almost all of the following will have an

78
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,199
'in general' before it…

79
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,479
… because there are almost 2,000 separate bureaucracies

80
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,799
administering land that, …

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,179
… were it a single country,

82
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,479
would be in the top ten list of biggest countries.

83
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,559
But in general, most of the Federal Land falls under the control of the President, …

84
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,719
… to whom a dozen secretaries report,

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,679
of which we care about three, that run five departments.

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,259
First, the Department of Defense:

87
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,859
she runs military bases,

88
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,319
and nuclear silos, and all the toys of war.

89
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,859
America has to keep them somewhere,

90
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,879
and if sororicide taught her anything,

91
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,119
it's don't trust the states with weapons.

92
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,799
So keep them close on Federal Land she does.

93
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,639
While America's military is big,

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,999
the Department of Defense holds the least land of the top five.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,919
Next is: The National Park Service:

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,819
The Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone,

97
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,999
and Blue Ridge Mountains.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,119
If there's an epic vista
you've visited or heard of in America,

99
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,479
it's probably one of hers.

100
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,679
The National Parks
is the celebrity of the group,

101
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,599
and can really stand out.

102
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,999
Next biggest is the Fish and Wildlife Service.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,239
Much less known, except if you're in Alaska where 85% of her land is.

104
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,399
Fish and Wildlife is in the business of animal conservation,

105
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,519
keeping land for America's species under her aegis,

106
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,999
not to be developed.

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,619
Then, there's the Forest Service --

108
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,559
often confused with National Parks,

109
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,278
but not remotely the same.

110
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,219
There's many a breathtaking national forest
you can hike through,

111
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,479
but they're not parks.

112
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,839
They're more America's resource tiles,

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,139
leased for logging.

114
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,999
Plus, grassland tiles for grazing.

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,359
Forest Service's job is to balance extraction
with maintenance.

116
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,259
How well she does this
is an endless source of argument

117
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,959
between America and the states

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,839
and the companies that want
to use those resource tiles.

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,419
It's a job that guarantees

120
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,559
someone is always going to be angry.

121
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,239
Only you can prevent forest fires?

122
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,799
That's the Forest Service,
because she deals with these kind of fires,

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,959
as well as these kind of fires.

124
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,719
And it's a job she splits
with the last and the biggest:

125
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,039
The Bureau of Land Management.

126
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,019
She does it all,
from resolving cow disputes,

127
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,399
to leasing land for mining,
to building parks, …

128
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,779
… to preserving the coastal waters of California

129
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,399
(which, surprise California, are Federal Land!).

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,139
BLM does a lot

131
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,799
and is the biggest which can make it very confusing

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,559
about which agency does what, but think of it this way:

133
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,719
There are three goals:

134
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,679
Conservation, Recreation, Extraction.

135
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,719
BLM does all three.

136
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,359
FS does Conservation and Extraction.

137
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,799
F&W does Conservation.

138
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,439
And NPS does Conservation and Recreation.

139
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,559
Again, in general.

140
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,279
These four plus War control 97% of Federal Land.

141
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,299
The last three percent is miscellaneous:

142
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,659
used by departments like the Postal Service,

143
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,159
or NASA, or the Department of Energy or others.

144
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,219
OK, this is lovely,

145
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,359
but like what does it mean to say that land is federal?

146
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,279
Is it part of the state or not?

147
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,599
Well, this brings up the delicate and sensitive balance

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,679
of power between the states and America.

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,359
And there's an enormous amount of words words words

150
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,519
around the sovereignty of governments.

151
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,959
But, ultimately, Federal Land belongs to America

152
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,939
and she can do with it what she wants,

153
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,839
and the states have to just suck it.

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,639
Most starkly in Nevada, where Federal Land was used for nuclear bomb testing.

155
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,919
Yeah, that's a pretty big hole you punched in Nevada, America.

156
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,939
Oh, not just the once...

157
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,039
Oh... Oh... Oh...

158
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,319
When push comes to shove,

159
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,599
America can shove.

160
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,679
That's the most extreme example,

161
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,459
but Federal Lands will often have their own separate

162
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,079
federal law enforcement officers.

163
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,959
Like the Investigative Services Branch:

164
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,519
a kind of FBI for National Parks.

165
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,699
Though state borders do matter here, for lesser crimes,

166
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,879
federal officers will often dump suspects into the state courts to deal with.

167
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,439
Private citizens can't buy property on Federal Land.

168
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,119
There are Americans who will tell you they live in a National Park.

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,119
Cape Cod and Fire Island National Parks are examples of this.

170
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,959
But if you zoom into official maps,

171
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,599
you'll often find hilarious borders that swoop around

172
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,839
and in between developed and undeveloped areas.

173
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,959
There’s also military bases, which will have soldiers living in them,

174
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,679
but they can't own anything.

175
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,359
And because it's Federal Land,

176
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,619
the Department of Defense that builds the housing can ignore all of a state’s laws

177
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,159
about housing or health codes.

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,599
So, a state can't control in a meaningful way Federal Land in her borders.

179
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,959
Hundreds of acres of federal grassland might suddenly be filled with grazing cattle, …

180
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,199
… or POW! be declared a national monument and preserved forever, …

181
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,519
… or plumbed for oil and mined for minerals,

182
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,839
with the state just standing on the sidelines watching.

183
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,259
Thus, states can't build their own towns or parks or factories in Federal Land to,

184
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,359
you know, collect any taxes from the land.

185
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,559
Which, once America made her intention to keep Federal Land forever, …

186
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,179
… made the states with a lot of it start to grumble,

187
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,639
grumble, grumble, GRUMBLE.

188
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,434
America: “Fine.

189
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:47,559
I'll give you payment in lieu of taxes. Are you happy now?”

190
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,219
States: “Is this a joke?

191
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,379
Is this for real?”

192
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,799
Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

193
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,719
All of this means today there's a big political divide

194
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,099
between the states that have a lot of Federal Land

195
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,799
and the states that don't.

196
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,919
With Eastern States thinking of Federal Land as belonging to the nation as a whole, …

197
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,519
… which is easy to do when

198
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,239
you don't have a lot of it within your borders and Federal Land, to you,

199
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,919
means visiting Glacier National Park on vacation.

200
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,599
Meanwhile, Western states are getting nuclear bombs detonated in their back yards, …

201
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,139
… and compensation they don't think is fair

202
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,079
for land that affects them that they can't control.

203
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,279
There's a million more complications this simplification can't possibly cover.

204
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,240
But, the best way to think about Federal Land is that while it may be in a state, it is not of the state.
