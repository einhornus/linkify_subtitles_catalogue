1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,749
Queen Lion is looking to make the elections
in her animal kingdom more fair.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,789
Currently she divides her citizens into ranges
each of which selects one representative to

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,808
go to the jungle council which makes laws
for the kingdom.

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,709
But her citizens are unhappy, and it's easy
to see why: the council is full of monkeys.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,838
Of course some of her citizens are monkeys,
but not all of them.

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,629
This council doesn't fairly represent her
kingdom.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,479
Queen lion visits one of the ranges to find
out what's wrong and how to fix it.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,658
In this range there five monkeys, four tigers,
three owls, two lynx and one buffalo.

9
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:34,869
One of each runs for representative and all
citizens vote for their own species.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,909
The election rule is that the candidate with
the most votes wins, which is the monkey.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,959
But it's a pretty unsatisfying result considering
that 2/3rds of citizens in this range *aren't*

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,748
monkeys and wouldn't vote for monkeys.

13
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:50,439
This is the same across all the ranges of
the kingdom, the monkeys have more votes than

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,409
anybody else, so they win all the elections,
even though they are a minority of the total

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,409
population.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,049
Closer inspection reveals that the independent
advisors hired to draw the range boundaries

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,678
in the first place weren't as independent
as they first appeared.

18
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,629
The result is unhappy citizens who don't trust
the jungle council to make the fairest laws

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,319
for all, quite rightly.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,519
Now Queen lion wants to maximize the number
of citizens happy with the election results.

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,078
One way to do that is to abolish the ranges
and use a proportional system...

22
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,839
...But her citizens *want* local representatives.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,109
So Queen lion needs a system that both make
her citizens happier by having a more representative

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,429
council while keeping local elections in place.

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,339
After doing a little research she finds out
how: Single Transferable Vote.

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,429
The big change with STV is that ranges send
more than one representative, which may seem

27
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,589
weird, but queen lion decides to test it out:
she takes three ranges which used to each

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,328
send one representative and combines them
into one bigger range that will send three.

29
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,849
On election day citizens go to the polls and
the results in this new range are just the

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,339
same as they were in the old ranges: 34% for
Monkey, 33% for Owl and 33% for Lynx.

31
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,478
But this isn't most votes wins: with STV to
figure out the winners take the total votes

32
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,389
and divide by the number of representatives
needed, in this case 3 which gives 33% as

33
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,538
the amount a candidates needs to win.

34
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,788
So *all three* candidates go to the council
-- which accurately represents the citizens

35
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,829
in the range.

36
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,419
Whereas under the old system each range would
have sent a monkey.

37
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,939
Leaving 2/3rd of the citizens without representation.

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,579
A bigger range with more representatives allows
the range to be more proportional.

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,829
This test turned out well, but it was also
as simple as could be -- now Queen Lion wants

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,889
to see what happens in a race where not everyone
is a winner.

41
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,839
The next big range she tests has five candidates
running for office: Gorilla, Tasier, Monkey,

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,279
Tiger, and Lynx, three of which can be representatives.

43
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,579
Election day comes and goes, and here are
the results of citizens first choices:

44
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,499
Tasier gets 5%
Gorilla gets 28%

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,309
Monkey gets 33%
Tiger gets 21%

46
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,729
Lynx gets 13%

47
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,909
As before, a candidate needs 33% to win.

48
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,069
Monkey has that as so is immediately selected
as one of the three representatives.

49
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,829
But no one else reached the winning 33% so
how are the other two representatives selected?

50
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,789
Step one: get rid of the biggest loser.

51
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,229
Sorry tasier -- you really had no chance at
all.

52
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,969
Now, when the citizens voted, they could have
just put an X next to the candidate they liked

53
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,499
most but with STV they can also rank their
favorite candidates.

54
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,519
This is important because it shows how the
election would have turned out if one of the

55
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,029
candidates hadn't run.

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,719
Tiny and Worried Tasiers would have voted
for the big calm gorilla without tasier in

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,719
the race.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,049
So if their candidate can't win, they want
their votes to go to Gorilla instead.

59
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,369
This pushes gorilla up to 33% and he become
the next representative.

60
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,219
Ranking allows citizens to support their favorite
candidate without worry -- there's no point

61
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,729
in strategizing about how everyone else is
going to vote.

62
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,289
The system works to maximize voter happiness
with the result.

63
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,589
Back to the range: there's still one representative
to select, so the next biggest loser is Lynx.

64
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,169
His voters don't like simians, but they do
think tiger's interests are similar to theirs

65
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,249
and so if Lynx can't win they want him to
have their votes.

66
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,259
Tiger gets reaches 33% and becomes the third
and final representative.

67
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,009
The election result looks pretty good especially
considering citizens first *and* second choices.

68
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,569
Now more citizens have a local representative
they can feel comfortable approaching, whereas

69
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,479
using the old system, everybody gets a monkey.

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,509
Lastly queen lion wants know what happens
in a range with just two political parties.

71
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,078
Under the most-votes-wins systems, multiple
candidates from the same party would be a

72
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,898
disaster: they'd split their voters and hand
the win to their opposition.

73
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,239
Queen lion makes one last test range with
2/3rd tigers and 1/3 gorillas that as before,

74
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,008
needs three representatives.

75
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:33,468
Because with STV citizens rank their candidates
there can be more than one candidate running

76
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:36,359
at the same time without any problems.

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,138
The tigers run two candidates as do the gorillas.

78
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:52,929
White tiger becomes the first representative,
but what happens next?

79
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,869
While tiger seems to be the biggest loser,
it's also obvious that he would have gotten

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,249
way more votes if white tiger wasn't in the
race.

81
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,818
If a candidate has more votes than they need,
like white tiger does, the first step is to

82
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,758
give the extra votes to their second choice.

83
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,688
This gets tiger to 33% and he becomes the
next representative.

84
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,859
If that seems strange, there are two things
to consider:

85
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,609
1) If instead the extra votes were ignored,
and tiger eliminated then the gorillas would

86
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,089
get the remaining two wins, which would obviously
not be represent the range.

87
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,739
2) Ignoring these 'extra' votes is punishing
citizens who backed the popular candidate,

88
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,859
which makes voters start thinking about how
everyone else will vote, rather than what

89
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,089
they really want.

90
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,009
If a candidate gets extra votes in the first
place it also means that those who voted for

91
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,499
him are a big section of the population and
thus fairly should get more representation.

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,908
Right: after the extra votes go to tiger,
the election finishes as before: Silverback

93
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:52,969
came in last, is eliminated and his voters'
second choice is the younger candidate so

94
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,288
gorilla gets in.

95
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,788
And the results are fair.

96
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,879
Queen Lion has now seen STV work.

97
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,198
Whether a range has one party or lots the
process is still the same:

98
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,198
1.

99
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,549
Citizens rank their favorite candidates.

100
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,549
2.

101
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,299
Any candidate above the threshold wins immediately,
3.

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,499
'Extra' votes go to their next choice.

103
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,499
4.

104
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,679
If no winner, last place is eliminated, and
the votes to go their next choice.

105
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,679
5.

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,598
Repeat until all the winners are found.

107
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,658
This whole this process is designed to maximize
the number of citizens who are happy with

108
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,658
the result.

109
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:25,869
This process gives STV has many advantages
over the old, most-votes-wins system:

110
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,869
1.

111
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,628
Citizens can honestly vote for their favorite
candidate without worrying about what everyone

112
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,668
else is going to do.

113
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:31,668
2.

114
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:32,668
It's more proportional.

115
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,348
So monkeying with the borders matters less.

116
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,348
3.

117
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,189
Almost all citizens will have a local representative
they actually voted for.

118
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,969
In the end Queen lion decides to switch the
council's elections to Single Transferable

119
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,649
Vote to make a better jungle council for all.
