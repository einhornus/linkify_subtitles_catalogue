1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,119
A calendar year is made of three hundred and
sixty five days -- a number that refuses to

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,768
be divide nicely, which is why we end up with
uneven months of either 30 or 31 days.

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:12,579
Except for February -- the runt of the litter
-- which only gets 28... except when it gets

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,869
29 and then the year is 366 days long.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,869
Why does that happen?

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,639
What kind of crazy universe do we live in
where some years are longer than others?

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,189
To answer this we need to know: just what
is a year?

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,609
Way oversimplifying it: a year is the time
it takes Earth to make one trip around the

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,609
sun.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,319
This happens to line up with the cycle of
the seasons.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,729
Now, drawing a little diagram like this showing
the Earth jauntily going around the sun is

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,189
easy to do, but accurately tracking a year
is tricky when you're on Earth because the

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,429
universe doesn't provide an overhead map.

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,499
On Earth you only get to see the seasons change
and the obvious way to keep track of their

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,259
comings and goings is to count the days passing
which gives you a 365 day calendar.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,209
But as soon as you start to use that calendar,
it slowly gets out of sync with the seasons.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,078
And with each passing year the gap gets bigger
and bigger and bigger.

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,809
In three decades the calendar will be off
by a week and in a few hundred years the seasons

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,099
would be flipped -- meaning Christmas celebrations
taking place in summer -- which would be crazy.

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,099
Why does this happen?

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,099
Did we count the days wrong?

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,077
Well the calendar predicts that the time it
takes for the Earth to go around the sun is

23
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:06,188
8,760 hours.

24
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:10,669
But, if you actually timed it with a stopwatch
you'd see that a year is really longer than

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,879
the calendar predicts by almost six hours.

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,019
So our calendar is moving ever-so-slightly
faster than the seasons actually change.

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,629
And thus we come to the fundamental problem
of all calendars: the day/night cycle, while

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,748
easy to count, has nothing to do with the
yearly cycle.

29
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:26,188
Day and night are caused by Earth rotating
about its axis.

30
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,188
When you're on the side faceing the sun, it's
daytime and when you're on the other side

31
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,188
it's night.

32
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,388
But this rotation is no more connected to
the orbital motion around the sun than a ballerina

33
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:36,618
spinning on the back of a truck is connected
to the truck's crusing speed.

34
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,258
Counting the number of ballerina turns to
predict how long the truck takes to dive in

35
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:43,359
a circle might give you a rough idea, but
it's crazy to expect it to be precise.

36
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,478
Counting the days to track the orbit is pretty
much the same thing and so it shouldn't be

37
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,789
a surprise when the Earth dosen't happen to
make exactly 365 complete spins in a year.

38
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,309
Irritatingly, while 365 days are too few 366
days are too many and still cause the seasons

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,739
to drift out of sync, just in the opposite
way.

40
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,068
The solution to all this is the leap year:
where February gets an extra day, but only

41
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:03,438
every four years.

42
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,039
This works pretty well, as each year the calendar
is about a quarter day short, so after four

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,388
years you add an extra day to get back in
alignment.

44
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,388
Huzzah!

45
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,389
The problem has been solved.

46
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,539
Except, it hasn't.

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,739
Lengthening the calendar by one day every
four years is slightly too much, and the calendar

48
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,129
still falls behind the seasons at the rate
of one day per hundred years.

49
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,458
Which is fine for the apathetic, but not for
calendar designers who want everything to

50
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,679
line up perfectly.

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,739
To fix the irregularity, every century the
leap year is skipped.

52
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,539
So 1896 and 1904 were leap years but 1900
wasn't.

53
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,238
This is better, but still leaves the calendar
ever-so-slightly too fast with an error of

54
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,999
1 day in 400 years.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,029
So an additional clause is added to the skip
the centuries rule that if the century is

56
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,878
divisible by 400, then it will be a leap year.

57
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,159
So 1900 and 2100 aren't leap years, but 2000
is.

58
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,179
With these three rules, the error is now just
one day off in almost eight thousand years

59
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,568
which the current calendar declares 'mission
accomplished' and so calls it a day.

60
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,389
Which is probably quite reasonable because
eight thousand years ago humans were just

61
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,729
figuring out that farming might be a good
idea and eight thousand years from now we'll

62
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,548
be hopefully be using a calendar with a better
date tracking system.

63
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:06,149
But perhaps you're a mathematician and a 0.0001
percent error is an abomination in your eyes

64
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,149
and must be removed.

65
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,369
"Tough luck" says The Universe because the
length of a day isn't even constant.

66
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,359
It randomly varies by a few milliseconds and
on average and very slowly decreases by about

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,109
1 millisecond per hundred years.

68
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,969
Which means it's literally impossible to build
a perfect calendar that lasts forever.

69
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,089
In theory the length of a day will expand
to be as long as a curent month -- but don't

70
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,018
worry in practice it will take tens of billions
of years, and our own expanding sun will destroy

71
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,798
the earth long before that happens.

72
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,128
Sorry, not quite sure how we got from counting
the days of the months to the fiery unavoidable

73
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,298
end of all human civilization -- unless of
course we have an adequately funded space

74
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,348
program (hint, hint) -- but there you have
it.

75
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,408
For the next eight millennia Leap years will
keep the calendar in sync with the seasons

76
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,889
but in a surprisingly complicated way.

77
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,289
You can learn a lot more about orbits, different
kinds of years and supermassive black holes

78
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,289
and over at Minute Physics.

79
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,169
As always, Henry does a great job of explaining
it all in his new video.
