00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,060
In my animal misconceptions video I casually
mentioned that daddy long legs aren’t spiders

2
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:07,309
and received a ton of comments asking for
clarification or suggesting that it’s not

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,329
that simple, so I feel the need to clear things
up a bit, but first, a disclaimer:

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,489
If images of spiders make you uncomfortable,
1) you shouldn’t have clicked on this video

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,449
and 2) you should stop watching, right, about
now.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,089
Cutest, spider ever.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,089
Right?

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,009
When editing the video, I decided to cut out
a daddy-longleg discussion, and now you’ll

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,009
see why.

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,749
To answer the question ‘are daddy longlegs
spiders?’

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,839
we first need to know, what are spiders?

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,698
And for that we need the biological classification
system you should have learned in high school.

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,659
Spiders are in the animal kingdom – which
is a pretty broad class of life and not helpful

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,159
in narrowing things down.

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,699
The phylum that concerns us are the arthropods
which are a subset of animals with external

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,999
skeletons, segmented bodies, and jointed limbs.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,439
The arthropods with exactly eight legs and
two body segments are in a class called arachnids

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,799
– where the name arachnophobia comes from
– and while often used to mean fear of spiders,

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,999
there are plenty of arachnids that are not
spiders, such as scorpions and mites.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,169
The true spiders, are a subset of Arachnids
in the order Araneae.

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,488
What defines these as spider are their fangs
and the poison glands within them, their numerous

22
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,578
eyes and their spinnerets that allow them
to make webs.

23
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,488
Now that we have a spider checklist on to
the second problem: the name ‘daddy longlegs’

24
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,459
means different things in different places.

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,779
In Australia this cellar spider is called
a daddy longlegs – which as an eight-legged,

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,139
multi-eyed, web-spinning member of Araniee
makes it an official spider.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,709
It also produces venom, but then so does everything
in that bloody country.

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,408
Where I grew up this is a daddy longlegs (sometimes
called a harvestman).

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,669
They have just two, soulless eyes, can’t
web sling and lack fangs and poison glands

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,349
and so fail the spider checklist and are in
a different order called Opiliones.

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,569
It was these I had it mind while making the
video.

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,478
To make things more complicated, in my adoptive
UK the british call this Crane Fly daddy long

33
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,478
legs.

34
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,079
Unlike the closely related Opiliones and Araniee
the Crane Fly isn’t an arachnid but an insect,

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,658
the class of arthropods with six legs and
three body segments.

36
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:44,349
And, as if the name wasn’t ambiguous enough
at this point, there is also a plant called

37
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,539
daddy long legs.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,478
For taxonomical completeness the plant is
over here a different kingdom.

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,749
But, because of the way life works even this
plant is distantly related to those other

40
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,079
daddy longlegs because plants and animals
are both eukaryotes which means that their

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,779
cells have complex structures, most notably
a nucleus.

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,509
So, to fully the first question: there are
four daddy long legs, three animals, two arachnids,

43
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,060
but only one spider among them.
