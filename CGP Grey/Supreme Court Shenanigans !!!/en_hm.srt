1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,079
In the United States,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,079
the Supreme Court is the highest court,

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,875
given the final say on what laws really mean,

4
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:07,984
and if they're cool with the Constitution.

5
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:10,820
Well, this power was not given given, but taken.

6
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:12,675
Back in the day, the Supreme Court ruled

7
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:15,739
it is the duty of the court to say what the Law is.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,119
And everyone went with it.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,548
You might think the Law would say what the Law is,

10
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:21,911
but even the best, most well-intentioned legislators

11
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:24,719
cannot write a law that covers every possible edge case

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,991
for the rest of time,

13
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,991
nor be able to consider how this law

14
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,991
will interact with every other law.

15
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,108
So someone's got to make the final call on the Law

16
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:34,108
and the Supreme Court is that someone.

17
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,264
This makes the Supreme Court supremely important, 

18
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:39,860
constitutionally and politically.

19
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,708
While Congress gets to make the laws

20
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,708
and the president gets to enforce the laws.

21
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,719
It's the nine court justices that both referee

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,268
and adjust the laws.

23
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:49,839
So if you're playing the game for

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,224
pure maximum political advantage,

25
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:54,064
you want to influence the refs.

26
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:56,064
Now, to be above this influence,

27
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:57,664
each justice serves for life.

28
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:01,344
So appointing a new one is an irreversible* [hmmm] decision,

29
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,148
that will affect decades of law.

30
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,413
Only when a justice resigns or dies does a seat open.

31
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:08,166
Filling that seat starts with the president,

32
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,802
who the Constitution gives the sole,

33
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,013
absolute power to select a nominee,

34
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:15,446
with no restrictions whatsoever on who the nominee can be.

35
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:17,933
No prior judicial experience required.

36
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:20,740
But, particularly in modern history, presidents tend to

37
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:23,955
select federal judges with long and clear case rulings,

38
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:25,802
hoping the past predicts the future.

39
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:26,762
[Mr. President]
No surprises, please.

40
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:29,744
This is my chance to influence government long after I leave.

41
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:32,159
[Grey]
Of course, the whole point of justices serving for life

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,769
is so, once in, they are politically beholden to no one

43
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,493
and don't have to strategically plan

44
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:39,417
how their current rulings will affect their next career move.

45
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:42,253
Getting on the Supreme Court is the final move.

46
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,908
Now, while the president can nominate whoever they want,

47
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,089
Congress must approve the nominee.

48
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,995
Well, not the whole Congress.

49
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,806
The lower House of Representatives

50
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:53,686
with its hundreds of members gets to do... nothing.

51
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:55,548
It's just the exclusive upper house

52
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,206
with its two senators per state

53
00:01:57,207 --> 00:02:00,762
that historically decides with a two-thirds* [hmmm] majority.

54
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:01,795
Before the Senate votes,

55
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:04,268
it puts the nominee in front of the Judiciary Committee,

56
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:07,759
which conducts the world's most arduous job interview over weeks,

57
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,526
asking the nominee just about everything in their lives they've ever done

58
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:14,304
and their opinions on everything that could ever happen.

59
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:16,660
All broadcast for the country to watch.

60
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,613
Which is why nominees play their cards close to their chest.

61
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:22,937
Answering questions about what they would do in theoretical cases with:

62
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:25,780
[Nominee]
I couldn't possibly comment on a case not before me,

63
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:28,348
that would be unbecoming of a future justice.

64
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,631
[Grey]
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the FBI investigates

65
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:32,631
everything private about the nominee's life

66
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:35,239
they might not wish to discuss before the cameras.

67
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,351
When the Judiciary Committee inquisition is over

68
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:39,831
the whole Senate then gets to vote yay or nay.

69
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,729
Nay, and the nominee is rejected

70
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,122
and the president must pick someone new to start over.

71
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,573
But yay! And the Supreme Court has a new justice

72
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:48,420
to help uphold the Constitution.

73
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:50,006
[delightedly]
Yay! All done.

74
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:53,257
Thank goodness such a vital process doesn't have any asterisks

75
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,748
or political shenanigans…

76
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:56,442
[sadly]
Ohhhh

77
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,282
Alright.  Let's do this.

78
00:02:58,283 --> 00:03:01,584
First are the normal political shenanigans around election dates.

79
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:04,573
While the president can nominate as soon as a seat opens,

80
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:07,489
there's no timeline for when the Senate has to vote on the nominee,

81
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,031
and so can just… not.

82
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:10,159
Running out the clock,

83
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,569
gambling on the next election getting a president of a different color.

84
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,333
On the flip side,

85
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:16,086
there's no minimum time either,

86
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:18,115
so an aligned president and Senate,

87
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:20,500
with an unfavorable election looming,

88
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,679
can work together very quickly to appoint a new justice.

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,904
These are normal election-time shenanigans.

90
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,166
But shenanigans beget shenanigans.

91
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,377
So the Senate doesn't work all year round,

92
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,969
taking seasonal recesses,

93
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,868
often in the summer and in the winter.

94
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:36,566
Or, if it's pandemic season, it's recess time too.

95
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,613
If a Supreme Court seat opens while the Senate is on recess,

96
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:40,980
according to the Constitution,

97
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:43,162
the president gets to instantly appoint someone

98
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:44,391
straight into the Court

99
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:47,504
who gets to stay there through the current Senate recess

100
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:49,380
and the next Senate session.

101
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,024
This is a recess appointment.

102
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:53,569
And boy does the Senate not like them.

103
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,406
Even though the appointed recess justice is temporary,

104
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:57,940
they're still a real justice,

105
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:00,064
getting to vote on cases before the Court,

106
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,446
without Senate approval.

107
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,289
And recess appointments aren't just for the Supreme Court,

108
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,471
but all sorts of government jobs.

109
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,079
The constitutional idea being

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,682
that legislating the government isn't full-time work.

111
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,366
The Senate, for the first 140 years of its existence,

112
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,977
spent half or more of each year in recess.

113
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:18,790
But executing the government is a full-time job.

114
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,669
Stuff's got to get done even if the Senate is on vacation,

115
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,071
so the Constitution gave the president the ability to

116
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:25,831
temporarily fill vital positions,

117
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,206
for a minimum length of time,

118
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:28,791
even when the Senate's not around.

119
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,453
And the Senate will get its say later when they're back to work.

120
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:32,973
[Mr. President]
Seems reasonable to me.

121
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:34,544
[Senate]
Don't like it.

122
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:38,442
[Grey]
But for 230 years, the Senate did like their Senate recesses

123
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:41,809
and thus presidents got their temporary recess appointments.

124
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,948
[delightedly]
Until the shenanigans began!

125
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,220
If a seat opened while an unfriendly Senate was in session,

126
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,999
the president could just wait until they went on recess

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,293
to make the appointment and thus at least get their unalloyed favorite

128
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,802
on the court straight away for a few months.

129
00:04:55,803 --> 00:04:59,664
[Senate]
Well, if you're going to wait until we're on recess, then we'll never take a recess.

130
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,137
[President]
You want to work all-year-round? Go right ahead.

131
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:05,999
[Senate]
Oh no, we'll take our vacations, just not a recess.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,406
The Senate had found a constitutional loop-hole:

133
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:09,948
the pro-forma session.

134
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,737
I will now re-enact, word for word

135
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:14,529
a complete day in the Senate with a pro-forma session.

136
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,068
I will be playing two parts: the Clerk and the Senator.

137
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:18,653
Ahem.
[clears throat]
Begin scene.

138
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:22,042
[Senator]
Senate will come to order.  The clerk will read a communication to the Senate.

139
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:24,377
[Clerk]
To the Senate, under the provisions of rule 1,

140
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:26,579
paragraph 3 of the standing rules of the Senate,

141
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,319
I hereby appoint the honorable senator from

142
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,402
the Great State of Delaware,

143
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:30,799
to perform the duties of the chair.

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,399
Signed, President Pro Tempore.

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,359
[Senator]
Under the previous order,

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,122
I declare the Senate stands adjourned for three days. [Plop]

147
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:37,853
[Grey]
End scene.  That's it!

148
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,369
An entire workday complete in what is quite often

149
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,093
literally less than twenty seconds.

150
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:43,264
Okay, here's what's going on.

151
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:45,831
The President Pro Tempore of the Senate is the longest-serving senator

152
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:47,395
and who runs the Senate's procedures.

153
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:51,104
But they can temporally delegate that power to someone else.

154
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:54,028
This is what the letter the clerk reads into the record is doing.

155
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,719
Translation: "This senator is in charge today."

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,577
And then the senator now in charge performs one action.

157
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:02,922
[Senator]
"Hey everyone, go home.  Let's meet again in three days".

158
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:04,231
[Grey]
Why three days?

159
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,006
Because the rule in the Constitution is that

160
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,715
if the Senate wants to take a three-day break

161
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:09,548
it can do so any time it likes,

162
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,860
but a four-day break requires approval

163
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:13,609
from the House of Representatives.

164
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,722
But there's no rule against taking a

165
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:18,239
three day break every four days,

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,944
as long as something happens on the fourth day.

167
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,675
And the minimum possible something

168
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:25,184
is the pro-forma session that calls for

169
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,675
another three-day break.

170
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:28,406
Oh and by the way,

171
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:31,904
the senator in charge is the only senator in the room.

172
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,086
[gleefully]
All the others are on vacation.

173
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:37,344
How is this remotely legit when a quorum of 51 senators

174
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,700
is required before the Senate can, you know,

175
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:40,799
do anything?

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,031
Well the Senate itself has decided the rule is to

177
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:44,435
presume that a quorum is present

178
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:47,620
unless someone asks for a roll call to show otherwise.

179
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:51,351
So if the one senator who is present does not ask for a roll call 

180
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,751
who knows how many senators are in the room.

181
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:55,024
We'll just presume it's 51.

182
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:57,635
So the Senate takes just as many breaks as it ever did,

183
00:06:57,636 --> 00:06:59,860
but is never officially at recess,

184
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:02,726
so if a justice unexpectedly resigns or dies,

185
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:05,577
the president is blocked from making a recess appointment.

186
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:08,239
It's impressive rules-lawyering according to the Senate,

187
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,239
but shenanigans according to the president,

188
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,239
so it was inevitable that they would get hauled

189
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,806
before the Supreme Court to make the final call.

190
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,268
The executive position being:

191
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,060
if all the senators are back at home except for the one junior kid

192
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:22,180
with orders not to roll call and note to say the magic words,

193
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,733
then by no means is the Senate in session.

194
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:28,340
And, the Supreme Court, in a nine zero decision completely agreed.

195
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,439
With the Senate.

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,002
[Chief Justice]
Listen, Executive Branch, I know you're annoyed,

197
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:33,177
but you don't get to tell the Senate when they're in recess.

198
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:34,966
And also now we don't have to work with the temp.

199
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,682
[Grey]
And thus recess appointments,

200
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:39,228
while theoretically still part of the appointment process,

201
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:41,737
will practically never happen again as long as

202
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:44,035
the Senate keeps up their pro-forma sessions.

203
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,748
Even though, delightfully, the Senate's official website

204
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:50,057
still talks about taking their annual August recess.

205
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:53,060
Which is the political equivalent of one branch of government

206
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,966
sticking out its tongue at the other.

207
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,962
But shenanigans beget shenanigans.

208
00:07:57,963 --> 00:08:00,224
Now, of course, the Senate is not one thing,

209
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:03,315
but 100 separate senators who are or aren't members

210
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,155
of the same party as the president.

211
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:06,929
So while the Senate blocked recess appointments

212
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,075
to always get to perform their confirmations,

213
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:12,108
the shenanigan escalation was to get the number of senators

214
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:16,304
who need to agree with the president's nomination as low as it can be.

215
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:20,013
This top sneaky shenanigan paperwork plan had the exciting name:

216
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:21,308
The Nuclear Option

217
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:23,809
But it's so bureaucratically boring

218
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,246
the details will induce coma in the listener,

219
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:27,429
(speaking from experience)

220
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,137
so we'll skip the details and just get to the results.

221
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:31,999
The two-thirds vote needed in the Senate

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,257
to approve a Supreme Court justice was the historical starting place

223
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,817
but that got whittled down to three-fifths,

224
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,969
then dropped down to half plus one,

225
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,779
which in practical terms means just one-half exactly,

226
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,559
because when there's a tie in the Senate, the vice president

227
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,122
(who will obviously side with the president)

228
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,744
casts the deciding vote.

229
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,300
Through the nuclear shenanigans,

230
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:53,853
it's become much easier for the president's nominee

231
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:55,722
to get permanently on the bench

232
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:59,475
and now the confirmation of the Senate the Constitution requires

233
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:03,169
can literally mean exactly half of the senators disapprove.

234
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,595
Again, rules-lawyering or shenanigans, is a matter of opinion

235
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,464
but shenanigans beget shenanigans

236
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,868
and there are more nuclear options still just waiting to be picked up.

237
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,882
For example, imagine the president and Senate

238
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:15,271
get a justice on the court,

239
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:18,035
and then later, a government of a different color is elected.

240
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:19,693
Because justices serve for life,

241
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:22,268
there's nothing the executive and legislative branches

242
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,922
can do until a justice dies or resigns.

243
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,508
[maliciously]
Or is there?

244
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,802
Oh, what's this?

245
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:29,126
Judicial impeachment?

246
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:30,908
I didn't know that was an option.

247
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:32,384
It is.  Surprise!

248
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:35,773
Congress can impeach and remove Supreme Court justices.

249
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,911
Now, this has never happened… fully.

250
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:39,577
There was one impeachment hearing of a

251
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,304
Supreme Court justice back at the start of the 1800s,

252
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:44,384
but the vote to convict didn't pass.

253
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:46,842
The whole incident set the precedent that the Supreme Court

254
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:49,024
should be left out of partisan politics

255
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:51,897
and justices shouldn't be removed for political advantage.

256
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,751
But precedents aren't laws,

257
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:56,399
and this incident did leave a little unclear

258
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,617
what the reasons to impeach could be.

259
00:09:58,618 --> 00:10:01,431
So that nuclear option is lying around.

260
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:05,700
Another technically possible nuclear shenanigan is forced recess.

261
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,424
The Constitution does have this power

262
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:09,889
where the president can (quote) from time to time

263
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,708
force the Congress back to the capital,

264
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,289
presumably to sort out some emergency business

265
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,919
(like in a war or a pandemic)

266
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,253
and then can forcibly dismiss them when done.

267
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,260
Now the exact clause has this weird detail that

268
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,129
if the Senate and House don't agree

269
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,722
on how long their recess will be

270
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,329
the president gets to decide.

271
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,019
So, if the Congress was on recess and

272
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,300
if the president called them back to then immediately dismiss them and

273
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:34,219
if the houses disagreed on how long the recess would be

274
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,777
then the president could force a long recess and

275
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:39,409
make recess appointments till their heart's content.

276
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,722
It shouldn't take much imagination to see why

277
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,420
the forced dismissal of Congress by the president

278
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:46,617
would be the most truly of nuclear shenanigans

279
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:47,948
and the fallout would affect,

280
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,860
like every part of the government.

281
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,108
But that's the sort of thing that can happen when

282
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,108
shenanigans infinitely escalate.

283
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:57,140
And given the supreme importance of the Supreme Court,

284
00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:00,064
doubtless the rules-lawyers are always looking for more.

285
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:02,559
Two recurring nukes being either trying to get

286
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,304
term limits on the Supreme Court justices

287
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,006
(but only when it's politically advantageous)

288
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:08,551
(and also to make the justices more politically influenceable)

289
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:11,584
Or failing that, simply packing the court with more.

290
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:15,715
But, of course, if and when any possible nuclear shenanigans triggered

291
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,362
doubtless the Supreme Court will instantly get involved

292
00:11:18,363 --> 00:11:19,802
to make the final call.

293
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:22,435
And if their earlier decisions are anything to go by,

294
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,166
don't bet a lot of money on the Court

295
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,908
deciding to make it easier to mess with the Court,

296
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:27,889
but who knows?

297
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,464
In the meantime, the current, possible process

298
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:31,809
is pretty straight forward.

299
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,049
The Senate never goes on recess, officially.

300
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,675
So when a seat opens the president picks a nominee.

301
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,940
And half or more of the senate must confirm that nominee

302
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:42,669
to the highest court of the land.

303
00:11:42,670 --> 00:12:03,990
[soft sneaky music fades]
