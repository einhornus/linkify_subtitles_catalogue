1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,099
8) Lets talk about Lemmings

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,449
When you hear the word “lemmings” you
might think of two things:

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,279
This video game and some sort of small creature
that suicidally leap off cliffs when its population

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,279
grows too large.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,069
In case you didn’t know lemmings are real
and adorable and not suicidal.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,159
The origin of this myth is a bit unclear but
the video game lemmings may have done a lot

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,059
more to convince a younger generation that
lemmings are willfully suicidal – and extremely

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,519
frustrating to micromanage thus deserving
of mass extermination.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,479
7) Daddly Longlegs

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,258
These wispy-looking things have earned the
reputation as the most poisonous of any spider.

11
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:33,910
But they’re also pretty common so, you might
wonder why more people don’t die from daddy

12
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,519
longlegs bites every year.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,149
Like a good conspiracy theory, this myth,
covers its own tracks by also saying that

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,529
their fangs are too small to penetrate human
skin.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,429
You could score one for team human except
that this misconception is a triple whammy

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,429
of wrongness:

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,109
1) Daddy Longlegs don’t have fangs because

18
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,599
2) They don’t produce venom because

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,328
3) They aren’t even spiders

20
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,009
6) Ostriches

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,179
Let’s review the properties of these flightless
birds, shall we?

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,129
They’re up to nine feet tall, up to 340
pounds, aggressive, with sharp beaks and long

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,129
claws.

24
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,939
Essentially an ostrich is the closest thing
to a living raptor you’re ever going to

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,939
see.

26
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,779
(That is our genetic engineering technology
gets better – common dinopocapolipse!).

27
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,109
Anyway, keeping these facts in mind, if you
decide to threaten an ostrich do you really

28
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,459
think it’s going to stick it’s head in
the sand and wait to die?

29
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,069
No, of course not, if you’re lucky it will
run away at 40 miles an hour and if you’re

30
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,499
not, it’s fatality time for you.

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,048
Ostriches have no reason to hide and especially
not in the stupidest way ever.

32
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,139
If they did they would have survived about
as long and another species of flightless

33
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,139
bird.

34
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,408
While we’re talking about flightless birds,

35
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,559
5) Baby Birds

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,639
A mother bird won’t abandon her baby because
you’ve touched it any more than a human

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,089
mother would abandon her baby if a bird touched
it.

38
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,339
If you find a baby bird and can easily reach
the nest, it’s perfectly fine to put it

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,339
back.

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,629
4) Goldfish Memory

41
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,008
Goldfish do have memories longer than three
seconds or seven seconds or whatever other

42
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,059
made up number always accompanies this fact.

43
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,428
They can actually be trained and will remember
what they learned for months.

44
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:47,089
Which is more than can be said for many humans.

45
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,978
On an unrelated note, Goldfish are also delicious.

46
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,239
3) Dog Vision

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,449
Poor dogs, forever living in their sad, monochrome
worlds.

48
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,548
Except, they don’t.

49
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,748
Dogs do see color, but not quite like us.

50
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:01,918
Most humans see three primary colors, red
blue and green, but dogs are limited to two:

51
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:05,239
they can see blues, but the rest of the color
spectrum they can’t tell apart.

52
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,148
Which they don’t mind, until you buy them
a red toy and throw it into the green grass

53
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,138
and act like they’re stupid for not finding
it.

54
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,589
It’s easy for you to see because your ancestors
spent several million years foraging for red

55
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,790
objects on a green background and so got quite
good at it – unless they didn’t which

56
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:20,229
in that case they died – but canine eyes
are not monkey eyes and to your dog, if it

57
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,768
isn’t blue it’s all the same color.

58
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,289
So next time you’re at the pet store, get
rover a blue toy.

59
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,359
And, while we’re talking about vision lets
talk about

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,359
2) Bats

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,509
Which, if you’ve ever looked at one, it
should be immediately obvious they’re not

62
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,458
blind because they look right back and you
– with their eyes – that they use to see

63
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:34,458
things.

64
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,059
But they do one better by having an additional
sense called echolocation that allows them

65
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,468
to navigate the world in complete darkness,
something you can’t do.

66
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:43,089
So from the bat’s perspective you’re the
blind one.

67
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,848
1) You Can Boil a Frog to Death if you do
it very slowly

68
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,768
This one is true… sort of.

69
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,919
Friedrich Goltz, demonstrated that a frog
will remain blithely in a pot of water brought

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,408
to boil if the temperature is raised slowly
enough.

71
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,779
However, the rather salient fact that is often
left out of the retelling is that Goltz cut

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,529
out the frogs’ brains before placing them
in the pot.

73
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,158
Which rather puts them at a disadvantage.

74
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,529
Goltz also showed that if you don’t lobotomize
the frog first then – surprise – it jumps

75
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,529
out of the pot.

76
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,139
It seems likely – but please don’t try
this at home – that removing the brain of

77
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,259
any animal would rather hinder their instinct
of self preservation.

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,599
And also make them more gullible about common
misconceptions.
