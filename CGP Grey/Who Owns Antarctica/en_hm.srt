1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,739
Antarctica! Home to the South Pole - s, penguins,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,819
and about 5,000 people during the summers.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,979
But less than 1,000 during the ever-dark winter.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,539
No one lives on the continent permanently.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,639
So, who owns Antarctica?

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,579
Most stuff outside national borders -

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,579
the sea floor, the moon, really all of space,

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,199
is the Common Heritage of Mankind.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,559
It belongs to none of us, and all of us -

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,339
held in trust for future generations.

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,619
Which is nice, if perhaps a bit presumptive, to say that

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,199
the entire Universe is ours.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,599
And maybe someone will have something to say about that eventually.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,259
(Story for another time)

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,059
But still, well done humanity!

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,919
Except... it's never that simple.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,799
Because the paperwork on Antarctica sort of says 'Common Heritage of Mankind',

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,999
but it doesn't go all in.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,959
Here's why - explorers started landing in Antarctica in about the 1800's,

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,759
planting flags and making claims.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,759
But these claims were a bit hollow,

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,679
because, on the Civilisation tech tree,

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,899
Antarctica wasn't colonisable.

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,319
Nonetheless, like Monopoly, the optimal colonial strategy is

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,679
'Claim everything you land on'.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,859
In the early 1900's, the UK toyed with claiming *all* of Antarctica,

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,859
because scaling back her ambitions to just

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,659
the coastal parts she had explored to the South Pole.

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,799
France also claimed coastal explorations to the Pole,

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,099
followed by Norway, followed by the Nazis.

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,299
Mid century, Argentina and Chile claimed slices overlapping with the UK,

32
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,439
who they figured was rather too busy at the time to care,

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,499
but later she and her now independent colonies totally did.

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,099
This left the Antarctica a mess of competing claims,

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,559
at a bad time to have large territorial disputes.

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,939
Complicating things, the United States and the Soviet Union gave themselves the right to make a claim on Antarctica,

37
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,739
not now, but maybe later.

38
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,799
Given this, quite remarkably, in 1959

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,479
the US, and USSR, and ten other countries,

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,579
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, and the UK,

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,779
made a treaty to ease the tensions,

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,219
saying that on Antarctica, there would be -

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,699
no military, no mining, and no nuclear exploding.

44
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,799
The Antarctican paperwork is the first Cold War disarmament treaty,

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,139
and set aside the continent for science and nature.

46
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,999
By the way, because it's a nature preserve,

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,679
there's a rule about garbage, 'Leave nothing behind'.

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,579
Nothing.

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,459
Travel to Antarctica in the Summer, and you'll fly back with your poo in the Winter.

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,919
So, this looks pretty great,

51
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,159
what's the problem with the line about common heritage?

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,839
Well, no one actually gave up their claims on Antarctica,

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,939
because the only way to get everyone to sign was to include this clause,

54
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,599
which sidesteps the issue.

55
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,539
Basically saying countries will act *as though* Antarctica is the Common Heritage of Mankind,

56
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,699
and *as though* they have no claims,

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,759
but they aren't legally "for realsies" giving up anything -

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,699
which is why maps of Antarctica often include the current state of claim wedges.

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,199
This blank spot, by the way, is nobody's,

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,299
leaving it the largest territory unclaimed by any nation,

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,379
so far, anyway.

62
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,819
Now, unlike the colonial days,

63
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,679
countries have the tech to build permanently staffed bases on Antarctica,

64
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,199
and it just so happens that countries build their bases in their own claims,

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,539
leaving no clear answer to this question.

66
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,239
According to the Treaty, Antarctica belongs to everyone,

67
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,799
but the Treaty itself has an intentional hole.

68
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,019
So Antarctica exists in this quantum state

69
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,379
where the claims are real and unreal.

70
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,599
Some countries build within their "borders",

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,099
and some countries without claims, like China,

72
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,739
build their bases on the continent wherever,

73
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,919
because it belongs to everyone, right guys?

74
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,339
These claims don't really matter,

75
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,979
until they do in the 2040's,

76
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,379
when the mining ban comes up for review.

77
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,579
Oh, and there's possibly a lot of oil in Antarctica,

78
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,499
not to mention 70% of the world's fresh water,

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,659
which could be the more valuable resource in the future.

80
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,319
The US and the Soviet... er... Russia,

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,979
might just yet dust off those 'One-free-claim-because-I-say-so' tickets.

82
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,119
But for now Antarctica is as the Treaty intended -

83
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,119
a continental nature reserve, and scientific research haven.

84
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,419
