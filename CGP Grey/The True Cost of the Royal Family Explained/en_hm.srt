1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,678
Look. At. That.
What a waste. That queen, living it off the

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,049
government in her castles with her corgis.
(and gin) Just how much does this cost to

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,939
maintain?
The answer: 40 million pounds.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,079
That’s about 65 pence per person per year
of tax money going to the royal family.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,909
Sure, It’s still twenty-three pence short
of a complete shield, but it might be more

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,249
than you want to pay.
Any after all, those are your coins. Why does

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,559
the queen get to steal them?
Well, it’s a little complicated.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,089
The story starts with this guy: King George
the third, most well known as the monarch

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,249
who lost the United States for the Empire.
Less well known – but far more interesting

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,729
– is he likely suffered from a mental illness
called Porphyria which has the unusual side

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,289
effect of transforming your poop from it’s
normal boring brown to a delightful shade

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,359
of purple.
But I digress – back to the the reason the

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,058
Royals get tax money.
King George was having trouble paying his

14
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,459
bills and had racked up debt.
While he did own huge tracts of land, the

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,328
profit from their rental was too small to
cover his expenses.

16
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,828
He offered a deal to parliament: for the rest
of his life he would surrender the profits

17
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,379
from the rents on his land in exchange for
getting a fixed annual salary and having his

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,349
debts removed.
Parliament took him up on the deal, guessing

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,959
that the profits from the rents would pay
off long-term.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,958
Just how well did parliament do? Back to the
present let’s compare their profits and

21
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,888
losses by using a tenner to represent 10 million
pounds.

22
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,998
The cost to maintain the royal family today
is 40 million pounds per year.

23
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:18,188
But the revenue paid to the UK from the royal
lands is 200 million.

24
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:24,298
200 million in revenue subtract 40 million
in salary costs equals 160 million pounds

25
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,129
in profit.
That’s right: The United Kingdom earns 160

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,600
million pounds in profit, every year from
the Royal Family.

27
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:33,600
So stop all your moaning about the Royal family
and how much they cost and how worthless they

28
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:34,638
are. The Royal Family is Great for Great Britain.
Doing the individual’s math again:

29
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:39,778
160 million pounds divided by 62 million people
is about 2 pounds and 60 pence.

30
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:44,008
Because of the Royal Family, your taxes are
actually 2 pounds and 60 pence cheaper each

31
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,519
year than they would otherwise be.
But perhaps that’s not enough for you because

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,858
you’re a real greedy geezer. Why not kick
they royals out and keep 100% of the revenue.

33
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:55,699
Because it’s still their land. King George
the crazy wasn’t crazy enough to give up

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,468
everything, just the profits.
But it wasn’t only him: every Monarch since

35
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,078
King George the third has voluntarilyturned
over the profits from their land to the United

36
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,828
Kingdom. Again: Voluntarily.
If the government stopped paying the Royal

37
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,059
Family’s living and state expenses the Royals
would be forced to take back the profits from

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,869
their land. And your taxes, dear Monarchy-haters,
would go UP not DOWN.

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,139
Plus 160 million is just the easily measurable
money the United Kingdom makes from the royal

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,809
family.
Don’t forget their huge indirect golden

41
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,759
goose: tourists.
Annoying though they might be to the locals

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,599
by blocking the tube and refusing to stand
on the right, they dump buckets of money on

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,739
the UK to see the sights, travel ludicrously
short distances by public transport, and generally

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,389
act silly a long way from home.
Sure not everything they come to see is royal,

45
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,189
but the most expensive stuff is.
And who are the biggest spenders? The Yanks.

46
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,409
After they’ve finished buying maple syrup
& cheap, pharmaceuticals, Tijuanaian professional

47
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,969
services & illegal pharmaceuticals, where
do they go next?

48
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,740
The United Kingdom.
Americans fly across an ocean to see a land

49
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:52,489
filled with Castles that aren’t plastic.
And why do the Americans think Frances castles

50
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,989
are so boring and stinky and the UK’s castles
so awesome? Because real monarchs still use

51
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,519
them.
The tower of London is so stunning to visitors

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,299
because the Royal Crest on the Yeomen Warders
Uniform is real. It’s not a lame historical

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,859
re-enactment or modern LARPing.
It’s the embodiment of the living, breathing

54
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,159
queen.
Everywhere you look she’s sprinkled fairy

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,199
dust on banal objects to make them magically
attractive to tourists.

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,149
12 million of whom visit every year spending
7,000 million pounds.

57
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,809
Which suddenly makes those direct profits
look like rather small change.

58
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,619
But perhaps you don’t care than the monarchs
are a perpetual GOLD MINE for the UK. You’re

59
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,229
a Republican and you dislike like the royal
family because of their political power. After

60
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,689
all, the government gets all its right to
rule through the crown, not the people.

61
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,789
And yes, I’ll grant you that back in the
head-choppy days of yore, this was a legitimate

62
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,759
concern, but the modern queen isn’t a dangerous
political lion but a declawed kitten.

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,069
Her powers are limited to a kabuki theater
act of approving what parliament wants to

64
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,719
do anyway.
Remove the royal family from government and

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,568
fundamentally nothing would be different except
now you wouldn’t live in the magical United

66
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,969
Kingdom but the rather dull United Republic
of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

67
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,679
A.K.A URESWNI for short. Doesn’t quite have
the same ring to it.

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,199
But, maybe I’m wrong – perhaps the queen
is a political ticking time bomb, just waiting

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,979
for her chance to declare random wars and
devolve parliaments for the lulz.

70
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,490
But until that day comes.
God save the queen.�
