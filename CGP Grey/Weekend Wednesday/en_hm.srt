1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,010
The way the work week works is the worst.

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:04,409
Waking up on Monday, you've got

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,285
five days in a row of work or school.

4
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:08,532
It's too much.

5
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,285
For, but by Wednesday,

6
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:13,012
withered is your soul with two more days,

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,039
nay three more days, until the weekend.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,272
But, alas.

9
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:19,272
The weekend is also broken.

10
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:21,532
Two is the wrong number of days off.

11
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,252
Because the first day off is just a collapse

12
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:26,085
from the overly long work week

13
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:27,252
and the second day off

14
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:29,705
is tainted by the looming Monday.

15
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:33,512
The traditional weekend is, at best, 50% efficient.

16
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:36,519
It takes three days off just to feel like two days off.

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,212
And two days off feels like one day off.

18
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:41,165
But here is where it gets interesting.

19
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,952
Because one day off isn't none-day-off.

20
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:46,659
A day off never goes unappreciated.

21
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,339
Which brings me to a new schedule for new living:

22
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,005
Weekend Wednesday!

23
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:52,545
Take the last three work days,

24
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:54,225
slide them over one slot,

25
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:57,379
and bring the spare weekend day forward to Wednesday.

26
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,159
Now, when you wake up on Monday

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,059
there's only two days to go until Weekend Wednesday,

28
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,405
then just three more days 'til Sunday.

29
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:05,752
I've been working on this schedule,

30
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:08,029
and boy do I love it!

31
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,565
Here are the advantages.

32
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,719
Productivity goes down without breaks.

33
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,525
That's true on the scale of a day

34
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:14,839
to the scale of a year

35
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,772
(or a life)

36
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:18,392
and it's certainly true on the scale of a week.

37
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:21,439
Well-timed breaks equals a more effective you.

38
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,439
A two day push, followed by a break

39
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,585
then a three day push

40
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:25,145
and rest

41
00:01:25,146 --> 00:01:27,519
feels amazing on both cycles.

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,165
The days off are more relaxing

43
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,139
and the days on more concentrated.

44
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,652
If you're self-employed with control over your schedule,

45
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:36,512
or a student able to pick classes to keep days clear,

46
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,009
I strongly suggest you give it a try.

47
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,405
And if you're an employer

48
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:44,079
your employee is enthusiastically sharing this video with,

49
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,759
it's worth considering if everyone is on board.

50
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,619
Now, of course, Weekend Wednesday won't work for the whole world

51
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,659
and that's fine.

52
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,352
Better even, because that creates an

53
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:54,945
off-cycle advantage for those of us who are on it.

54
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:57,565
Having a free day when everyone else is working

55
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:01,999
makes so many things easier and faster and crowd-less.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,085
As for the Saturday,

57
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:05,505
you now have time to wrap up the work week

58
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:07,992
without interruptions from the rest of the world,

59
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:10,845
leaving Sunday as a true day of rest.

60
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:13,699
So that's the glory of Weekend Wednesday!

61
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,325
More frequent days off that feel 100%.

62
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:18,679
More concentrated and shorter work sprints

63
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,952
with a bonus off cycle advantage.

64
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,505
If those sounds intriguing, why not give it a try

65
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:26,569
and see if Weekend Wednesday works for you.

66
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:44,566
