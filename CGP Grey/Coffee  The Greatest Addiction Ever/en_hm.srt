1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,309
Every day the world consumes 300 tones of
caffeine -- enough for one cup of coffee for

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,139
every man, woman and child.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,969
The world's largest buyer of coffee, the US,
has to import nearly all of this as the coffee

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,989
trees from which caffeine is harvested will
only grow at commercial levels between the

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,109
tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn
in an area called the coffee belt. Only a

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,609
single state, Hawaii, is within the belt.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,448
However, the United States is only the largest
buyer because it's so populous. The most enthusiastic

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,528
coffee drinkers per capita are, in increasing
order, the Netherlands, Denmark, Iceland,

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,569
Norway and, the world champions, Finland,
where they drink three times as much coffee

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,199
a day as the average American. All of these
countries are outside of the coffee belt and

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,209
must import 100% of their caffeine supply.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,209
To get this caffeine, first bees must pollinate
the flowers of a coffee tree and these flowers

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,288
develop into bright red berries. Unlike more
cooperative domesticated plants, the coffee

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,218
tree does not ripen all its berries at the
same time so they need to be hand picked and

15
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,408
sorted.

16
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,678
Once picked, the coffee bean is removed from
inside the berry. This young seedling of the

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,228
tree is then dried, heated, ground and submersed
in boiling water to get out the precious,

18
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:01,138
precious caffeine. It takes about 40 coffee
beans to make one shot of espresso.

19
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:05,128
But why is caffeine in the coffee beans in
the first place? It's not like the coffee

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,228
trees want to have humans cutting bits of
them off and committing a holocaust of their

21
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:09,309
offspring.

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,309
Well, the trees, of course, don't want or
feel anything and originally evolved caffeine

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,658
for their own benefit. Caffeine is an insecticide
that effectively paralyzes or kills bugs chomping

24
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:18,658
on the tree.

25
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,508
Whether or not the insects go out experiencing
the greatest caffeine high ever is not known.

26
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:27,758
While caffeine is /technically/ lethal, it's
adapted for for 1g bugs, not monkeys 100,000

27
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,769
times more massive. So you'd really have to
try to win this Darwin Award.

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,288
But, if you must: to calculate the dose of
caffeine you'll need to ingest to have a 50%

29
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:39,819
of death, take your mass in kilograms and
multiply it by 150mg.

30
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,529
Or in terms of coffee, for every kilogram
of mass you have you need to drink one latte

31
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,059
to get a visit from the grim reaper.

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,478
That's a lot of coffee so it's not suprising
that there are no recored deaths in healthy

33
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,288
adults from this method and it's doubtful
that it's even possible. Because, while you're

34
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:56,508
busy getting the coffee in, your body is busy
getting it out by one way or another.

35
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,968
The rare recorded deaths from caffeine are
from diet pills, pep pills and crazy people

36
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,529
who eat the drug in its pure form.

37
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,809
Poison though caffeine is, you do still develop
addiction to the stuff. And it's is a real

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,728
physiological addiction not a wimpy psychological
addition like people claim for videos games

39
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,728
and the internet.

40
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,529
But caffeine isn't heroine -- rapid withdrawal
won't kill you -- it might make you cranky

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,929
and give you a wicked headache -- but since
caffeine releases dopamine to make you happy

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,219
and it gets rid of headaches there's really
no reason to ever stop using it.

43
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,629
And who would want to give up the stuff anyway?
I mean, aside from converts to Mormonism and

44
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,889
Rastafarianism. Caffeine is the world's most
used psychoactive drug -- and with good reason

45
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,309
it's pure awesome.

46
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,359
It increases concentration, decreases fatigue
and gives you better memory.

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,419
This isn't just a placebo -- these are real
effects replicable in a laboratory.

48
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,438
And, contrary to popular belief, drinking
coffee isn't a faustian bargain where the

49
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,179
devil gives you the ability to work faster
but in exchange makes your life shorter.

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,789
For normal, healthy humans there are no medical
concerns. Coffee and the caffeine within it

51
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,548
may even has medical benefits such as protection
from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and

52
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:53,869
Parkinson's.

53
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,839
Caffeine can even get rid of migraines, but
the amount required and the and method of

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,179
ingestion is... uncomfortable.

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,219
Moving right along...

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,729
You know what else you can thank caffeine
for? A little thing called the enlightenment.

57
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,389
In the 1600s people drank more beer and gin
than water. But with the introduction of coffee

58
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,979
and tea, people switched from a depressant
to a stimulant. It's not surprising then that

59
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,809
this time was an intellectual boon compared
to earlier centuries.

60
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,509
Ben Franklin and Edward Lloyd loved their
coffee for the same reason that modern workers

61
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,009
and students do. It's invaluable for staying
awake and concentrating when you need to finish

62
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,729
a TPS report or to get through that boring
physics class.

63
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,309
Coffee is the fuel of the modern world, so
go grab a cup guilt-free and get working smarter

64
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,939
and faster.
