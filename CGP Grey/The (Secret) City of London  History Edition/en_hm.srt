# The (Secret) City of London -- Part 1

2
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,938
The Great City of London, known for its historical
landmarks, modern skyscrapers, ancient markets

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,269
and famous bridges. It's arguably the financial
capital of the world and home to over eleven

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,549
*thousand* people.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,119
Wait, what? Eleven... thousand?

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,149
That's right: but the City of London is a
different place from London -- though London

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,838
is also known for its historical landmarks,
modern skyscrapers, ancient markets, famous

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:24,428
bridges and is home to the government, royal
family and seven million people.

9
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,078
But, if you look map of London crafted by
a careful cartographer that map will have

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,249
a one-square mile hole near the middle -- it's
here where the City of London lives inside

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,749
of the city named London.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,299
Despite these confusingly close names the
two Londons have separate city halls and elect

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,039
separate mayors, who collect separate taxes
to fund separate police who enforce separate

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,689
laws.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,009
The Mayor of the City of London has a fancy
title 'The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor

16
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,919
of London' to match his fancy outfit. He also
gets to ride in a golden carriage and work

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,739
in a Guildhall while the mayor of London has
to wear a suit, ride a bike and work in an

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,639
office building.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,799
The City of London also has its own flag and
its own crest which is awesome and makes London's

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,799
lack of either twice as sad.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,578
To top it off the City of London gets to act
more like one of the countries in the UK than

22
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,349
just an oddly located city -- for uniquely
the corporation that runs the city of London

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,959
is older than the United Kingdom by several
hundred years.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,228
So how did the UK end up with two Londons,
one inside of the other? Because: Romans.

25
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,079
2,000 years ago they came to Great Britain,
killed a bunch of druids, and founded a trading

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,728
post on the River Thames and named it Londonimium.
Being Romans they got to work doing what Romans

27
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:28,669
do: enforcing laws, increasing trade, building
temples, public baths, roads, bridges and

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,339
a wall to defend their work.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,459
And it's this wall which is why the current
City of London exists -- for though the Romans

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,009
came and the Romans went and kingdoms rose
and kingdoms fell, the wall endured protecting

31
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,548
the city within. And The City, governing itself
and trading with the world, grew rich.

32
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,548
A thousand years after the Romans (yet still
a thousand years ago) when William the Conqueror

33
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,559
came to Great Britain to conqueror everything
and begin modern british history he found

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,569
the City of London, with its sturdy walls
more challenging to defeat than farmers on

35
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,719
open fields.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,579
So he agreed to recognize the rights and privileges
City of Londoners were used to in return for

37
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,868
the them recognizing him as the new King.

38
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,548
Though after the negotiation, William quickly
built towers around the City of London which

39
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:10,317
were just as much about protecting William
from the locals within as defending against

40
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,949
the Vikings from without.

41
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,559
This started a thousand-year long tradition
whereby Monarchs always reconfirmed that 'yes'

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,409
the City of London is a special, unique place
best left to its own business, while simultaneously

43
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,318
distrusting it.

44
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,839
Many a monarch thought the City of London
was too powerful and rich. And one even built

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,419
a new Capital city nearby, named Westminster,
to compete with the City of London and hopefully,

46
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,779
suck power and wealth away from it. This was
the start of the second London.

47
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,629
As the centuries passed, Westminster grew
and merged with nearby towns eventually surrounding

48
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,629
the walled-in, and still separate City of
London. But, people began to call the whole

49
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,549
urban collection 'London' and the name became
official when Parliament joined towns together

50
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,199
under a single municipal government with a
mayor.

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,499
But, the mayor of London still doesn't have
power over the tiny City of London which has

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,389
rules and traditions like nowhere else in
the country and possibly the world.

53
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,878
For example, the ruling monarch doesn't just
enter the City of London on a whim, but instead

54
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,159
asks for permission from the Lord Mayor at
a ceremony. While it's not required by law,

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,909
the ceremony is, unusual to say the least.

56
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,488
The City of London also has a representative
in Parliament, The Remembrancer, whose job

57
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,689
it is to protects the City's special rights.

58
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,488
Because of this, laws passed by Parliament
sometimes don't apply to the City of London:

59
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:21,589
most notably voting reforms, which we'll discuss
next time. But if you're curious, unlike anywhere

60
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,679
else in the UK elections in the City of London
involve Medieval Guilds and modern companies.

61
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,059
Finally, the City of London also owns and
operates land and buildings far outside its

62
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,128
border, making it quite wealthy.

63
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,848
Once you start looking for The City's Crest
you'll find it in lots of places, but most

64
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,579
notably on Tower Bridge which, while being
in London is operated by City of London,

65
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,598
These crests everywhere when combined with
the City of London's age and wealth and quazi-independent

66
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,848
status make it an irresistible temptation
for conspiracy nuts. Add in the oldest Masonic

67
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,429
temple and it's not long before the crazy
part of the Internet yelling about secret

68
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,458
societies controlling the world via the finance
industry from inside the City-state of London.

69
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,229
(And don't forget the reptilian alien Queen
who's really behind it all.)

70
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,009
But conspiracy theories aside, the City of
London is not an independent nation like the

71
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,889
Vatican is, no matter how much you might read
it on the Internet, rather it's a unique place

72
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,799
in the United Kingdom with a long and complicated
history.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,458
The wall that began all this 2,000 years ago
is now mostly gone -- so the border between

74
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,518
London and its secret inner city isn't so
obvious. Though, next time you're in London,

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,668
if you come across a small dragon on the street,
he still guards the entrance to the city in

76
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:27,520
a city in a country in a country.
