00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,159
Hello Internet.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,919
When's the next Q&A with Grey?
-Discord21337

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,599
Right now!

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,999
What opinion have you held for a time and then changed radically?
-desvirtuado

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,219
Well, as mentioned the first time I talked about changing your mind,

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,519
This is always hard to discuss

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,099
because the specifics are often quite personal.

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,239
But the biggest non-personal thing
I've changed my opinion on is

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,919
breakfast.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,079
I used to believe breakfast was absolutely vital -

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,279
not just believe it -

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,639
I had evidence that skipping, nay even

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,619
delaying breakfast ruined everything.

14
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,179
But as I've tried to get healthier,

15
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,179
slowly and inconsistently,

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,839
I've experimented with various things and the one that shocked me the most is

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,259
breakfast is bulls**t.

18
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,439
After an admittedly rough adjustment period,

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,439
my body no longer needed breakfast,

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,939
and it's hard to describe

21
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,599
just how much of a huge quality-of-life improvement this has been.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,719
Simplifying my normal morning routine

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,859
and making early travel days easier.

24
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,799
While I'll still eat breakfast sometimes,

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,899
particularly on vacations,

26
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,699
because it's clearly the best of the three

27
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,239
(seven)

28
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,679
meals, it's no longer the necessary part of life I thought it was.

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,479
What do you want people to remember you for 500 years from now?
-Coolie2

30
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,179
I don't want to be remembered,

31
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,779
I want to be alive.

32
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,519
What is the most frivolous item you own?
-ClenchtheHenchBench

33
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,519
Man, that is a good question

34
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,059
that had me looking up exactly what "frivolous" means:

35
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,199
Not having purpose or value.

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,899
So, a thing I own which has neither purpose nor value.

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,839
I'm not really sure anything I own fits that description,

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,219
but I'll keep looking for you.

39
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,199
If you have an idea in the shower without phone or notebook present, what do you do?
-Hoepla

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,619
(Shower sounds)

41
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,239
Hey Siri!

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,219
Hey Siri!

43
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,259
(Siri pings)

44
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,379
Make a note;

45
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,979
must not forget

46
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,539
million - nay, billion dollar idea

47
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,739
(Siri pings)

48
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,699
Nice weather coming up for Paradise, Nevada, United States.

49
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,499
(Grey groans)

50
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,139
What do you think of jazz?
-Maxim_Potashov

51
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,999
Jazz is the opposite of everything I like in music.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,199
I want music to have patterns and repetition.

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,199
Patterns and repetition.

54
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,619
This is why I also don't like live music.

55
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,199
I view music as a brain manipulation tool, and to that end, jazz is anti-useful to me.

56
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,539
Do you speak dutch?
-Riobhain

57
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,379
(In Dutch) I don't speak Dutch, my mother is Dutch, but she never spoke Dutch with me.

58
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,379
(In Dutch) I grew up speaking just one language.

59
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,379
If you had control of a super-intelligence to which you could only give 1 command,

60
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,939
and it would execute it to the best approximation of what you intended, what would your one command be?
-DeepFriedJif

61
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,479
Min-max happiness and suffering.

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,019
Oh wait!

63
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,739
What's one thing that you're not satisfied with your life right now, and how do you plan to solve it?
-Living-stoneInAfrica

64
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,039
I've gotten into time tracking pretty deeply.

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,039
I used to just track my work hours, but I began to record how every hour of every day is spent.

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,219
And, let me tell you

67
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,199
no matter how well you think you spend your time, and no matter how well you do spend your time,

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,099
tracking all of your time is an unflinching look into a mirror, eternally uncomfortable.

69
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,139
So, I'm not thrilled with the way my pie chart for last year looks.

70
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,239
It was a year of chaos.

71
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,979
But, it's not possible to improve without knowing where you're starting

72
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,419
and one of the ways I'm working to make this better is simply to have the data about how I spend my time

73
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,459
more visible in more places.

74
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,399
I've just begun in the most baby steps way possible, but so far,

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,379
making life more visible seems like a good feedback loop.

76
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,419
How are you doing?
-MrEngineeringGuy

77
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,119
Good, thanks.

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,659
You?

79
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,139
If you had to enroll at a university tomorrow and had to choose one field of study which would you choose?
-rubinowitz

80
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,199
I'd like to say I'd take a programming course

81
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,059
but I'm pretty sure I couldn't pass at the university level.

82
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,019
Constants and functions and loops, oh my,

83
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,339
are fun and clear but once it gets to pointers,

84
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,139
it's a level too far.

85
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,239
So if I needed to pass I'd probably sign up for economics

86
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,839
I dropped out of that Master's course

87
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,039
as mentioned in a previous Q&A because it wasn't the right fit in my life at that time

88
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,839
but I'd be happy to give it a go again.

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,839
Of all the classes you've ever taken at Uni, what was your hardest?

90
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,819
What did you hate the most? Why?
-Negative-One-Twelfth

91
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,099
Well, the physics classes in my later years were the hardest and

92
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,419
were probably the hardest intellectual thing I've ever done or will do.

93
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,319
But that's the boring-er question.

94
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,459
More interesting question is which class I hated the most.

95
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,779
That was a required humanities reading class

96
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,369
It was one of those classes where

97
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,389
the professor had free rein to just select a bunch of books they liked and

98
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,439
force students to read them and write essays

99
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,429
agreeing with the professor or

100
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,299
disagreeing in a way the professor agreed with.

101
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,619
God, did I hate it.

102
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,199
I really think it's the kind of class

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,539
that professors make mandatory because they

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,939
like to teach it and it makes them look smart and

105
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,859
it's easy and not because it's remotely good for the students involved.

106
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,018
Anyway, it had to be done

107
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,819
and I had a pretty good idea in advance I would hate it

108
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,739
so at my college there was an option

109
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,779
to compress an entire academic year of these classes into one intense summer.

110
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,239
So I stayed at college over what was vacation for most people

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,279
to finish this class as fast as possible.

112
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,879
I've always been pretty good at reading a lot using an on-off schedule when I need to,

113
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,739
and it served me well here.

114
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,499
I think I read something like 30 stupid or boring or flowery or pompous books over that summer.

115
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,539
Anyway, it works so well it was a strategy I used every summer,

116
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,079
compressing as many dumb mandatory classes into as short a time as possible

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,639
If your school gives that as an option, I highly recommend it

118
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,719
so you have more time during the rest of the year to focus on more important things.

119
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,099
Raisins in chocolate chip cookies?
-interesting-__o__

120
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,219
Gross.

121
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,019
What noise do you wake up to?
-architecty

122
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,539
None. I used to use music to wake up to, because this

123
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,439
(wake-up alarm sounds)
is the world's most unpleasant sound.

124
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,599
But doing so trains yourself to dislike whatever song you use

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,099
and have it randomly cause you a sense of drowning anxiety

126
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,679
when you hear it in a different context.

127
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,159
I used to use a Sigur Rós song during my teaching years to wake me up,

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,799
and I still can't hear the opening few seconds

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,059
without feeling like I'm drowning, a decade later.

130
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,879
Of course, the sound may be none

131
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,319
but I currently use my Apple Watch to wake me up with a vibration.

132
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,979
And I know I'm in a good routine when I wake up naturally before it goes off.

133
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,079
If you could have one superpower (excluding the power to have all powers),

134
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,179
what would it be?
-jackmedrek

135
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,339
Invulnerability.

136
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,279
With an exit option.

137
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,379
Can you wear silly ties for the rest of the video?
-Nesogra

138
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,259
No, I spent years plotting and scheming how to escape the world of ties.

139
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,999
I will not go back to it now.

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,339
You are given the opportunity to permanently, and irreversibly, change one fundamental law of physics.

141
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,079
What would it be and why?
-Blarghenshnarf

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,719
On the panel of fundamental laws and constants,

143
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,459
I've draped a very big "do not touch" sign

144
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,659
How do I get over a crippling Factorio addiction?
-Ggecho_Swe_

145
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,319
You tell me, man. I'm over a thousand hours deep.

146
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,059
Do you feel that "Humans need not apply" needs ... updating?

147
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,259
Has anything changed since its creation that would change your message?
-DarkJohnson

148
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,719
Not really anything I would change.

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,879
I do enjoy that the debate around autos has switched from

150
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,399
"They'll never happen" to "Why aren't they here now?",

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,159
which is an interesting question.

152
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,809
At least in this moment, it feels like progress and self-driving cars is a bit of an s-curve,

153
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,659
so maybe I was over-optimistic about the rapid approach of commercially-available autos,

154
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,559
but I still think they're coming,

155
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,179
and if I can't buy or rent an auto within ten years of the publication of that video,

156
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,959
I'll be surprised and disappointed.

157
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,599
What is love?
-theheroinwaiting

158
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,179
What is love?

159
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,459
Baby don't hurt me,

160
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,919
don't hurt me,

161
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,920
no more.
