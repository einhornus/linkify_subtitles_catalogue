00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,568
What is reddit?

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:05,569
For much of The Internet reddit is the gateway
to everything interesting going on in the

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:05,909
world.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,089
Checking reddit.com is like reading the daily
newspaper except that reddit is

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,199
- timely
- interactive

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,489
- personalized
- participatory

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,768
- horrifilying absorbing at times

8
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,149
...basically, *good*.

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,059
The way it works is that people submit links
to reddit (blog posts or images or videos)

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,168
and other people vote those links up or down.
It's a simple idea but it makes reddit into

11
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:27,738
a list of the best stuff that people are reading
or watching on The Internet right now.

12
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,338
The name is a contraction of 'Read It' as
in: I already read it on Reddit, which if

13
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:35,238
you spend significant time on the site, is
what you'll say to everyone who tries to show

14
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:38,189
you anything. It's a kind of awesome curse.

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,229
Because there are no editors on reddit you
never know what you're going to find but you

16
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,919
can bet it's going to be funny or interesting
or enranging because 1,000s of other people

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,459
have already voted that it's something to
see.

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,729
Think of it this way: if Google is where you
go to search for things, then reddit is where

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,288
you go to see the things that people have
found.

20
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:58,319
But reddit is not just one list of stuff:
reddit is a beautiful fractal with sections,

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,439
called subreddits.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,819
If you just like politics or programming or
funny image captions or sports or world news

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,869
there are subreddits that list only that stuff.
And there's going to be a subreddit for your

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,899
city or country or region.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,329
Love a TV show that ended years ago? There's
a subreddit where people are still talking

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,009
about it as though it just aired.

27
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,099
Tech have geeks their technology and flag
geeks have their vexillology and -- and on

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,249
the off chance you're interested in something
the doesn't yet exist, just press a button

29
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,059
and a new subreddit is born.

30
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,719
Each subreddit works just like the main page:
an updating list of interesting stuff according

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,389
to the people interested in that stuff.

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,879
And when a subreddit grows large it can be
terrifyingly good at this: for example AWW,

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,949
a section devoted to adorableness, is a GLOBAL
24-HOUR-A-DAY BATTLE TO FIND THE CUTEST IMAGES

34
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,679
EVAR!

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,309
Turns out if you give people with baby animal
photos a place to have their baby animal photos

36
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,529
compete the result is the highest density
of cuteness human civilization has yet created.

37
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,019
But without editors running the site, how
does that sorting process work? There's no

38
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,669
time to get into the code, but you can think
of it like this:

39
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,439
Links people sumbit are balloons floating
up and down the list. When someone votes up

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,799
a link it adds a bit of helium and a down
votes sucks out little bit of helium. Periodically

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,239
reddit puts weights on all of the balloons
-- giving newer links that show up later a

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,379
chance to compete against the ones that have
been around longer.

43
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,529
This method is shockingly good at sorting
stuff, be it international politics or pictures

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,399
of computer setups.

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,149
Of course, when a website covers the whole
of human endeavor things get weird: like subreddits

46
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,979
for only photos of birds... with arms or only
photos of hitler... with socks and then there

47
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,969
are always the other kinds of photos humans
like to look at and sometimes collections

48
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,079
of horrifying things that cannot be unseen.

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,479
So yeah, this has taken a turn for the worse.
But remember reddit can be weird not because

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,309
reddit is weird but because humans are weird.
And the great thing about reddit is that it

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,479
changes to suite you: as you join subreddits
you like and leave those you don't the main

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,409
page becomes *yours*: listing all the best
stuff from all the subreddits you follow and

53
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,709
leaving out stuff from the ones you don't.

54
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,029
So reddit is lot like life: it is what you
make it.

55
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,818
But links are only the tip of the redditberg,
because people can discuss the links and this

56
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,029
is where the true heart of reddit lies.

57
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,989
Most forums on The Internet are hideous, but
Reddit ain't your grandma's bulletin board.

58
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,059
Just as that baloon sort method finds the
best links there's some math that's more complicated

59
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,259
(and less explainable) that finds the most
interesting comments in a discussion and brings

60
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,779
them to the top. And reddit displays comments
in a way that encourages back-and-forth discussions.

61
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,079
(Unlike some *other* comment systems).

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,239
This sorting and threading means that the
discussion of a link on reddit is always more

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,029
interesting than the link itself.

64
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,929
So there are subreddits that are nothing *but*
discussion: such as Change My View for debates

65
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,059
or Ask A Scientist where experts answer questions.
Or there1s 'IamA' where people say what they

66
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,339
are "I am a fireman" or "I am an Escort" or
"I am a prison guard" and answer questions

67
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,339
from the comments.

68
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,039
And because people on reddit are anonymous,
discussions are way more interesting and open

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,669
than if people were forced to use their real
names. ::cough:: YouTube & Google+ Integration ::cough::

70
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,818
 

71
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,929
Though, with anonymity you'll find that not
everyone's private thoughts exposed are beautiful.

72
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,958
And sometimes it can be uncomfortable to see
what the faceless group thinks about a topic.

73
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,469
But luckily reddit has a way to deal with
comments you think are unhelpful. And despite

74
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,109
people who act badly it's clear that reddit
can only exist because the majority of people,

75
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,149
even when anonymous, are good.

76
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,488
But this anonymity isn't required, however
so you'll also find Actors and Authors, Presidents

77
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,839
and prime ministers all on reddit answering
questions from the community.

78
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,439
And reddit really is a community with it's
own culture and history and that increasingly

79
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,419
has an effect on the physical world with things
like: meeting up in person and raising money

80
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,578
for charity and defending the Internet and
helping a family be with their sick child

81
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,168
and holding the word's largest secret santa
and sending teachers the supplies they need.

82
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,188
With its rapid-fire democracy and shocking
quick reactions, reddit can sometimes makes

83
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:32,489
you feel more like a citizen of the Internet
than a citizen of your own country.

84
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,938
But in the end it's hard to understand reddit
without just jumping in and commenting and

85
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:40,299
voting, which you really should. And once
you get the hang of the place, you'll wonder

86
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,899
how you ever Internetted before.

87
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:51,288
[After credits]

88
00:04:51,289 --> 00:05:06,929
P.S. If you are already a user of reddit and
love the site, you should consider buying

89
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,948
some reddit gold to support it. I was surprised
to learn while making this video that despite

90
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,369
its increasing popularity reddit still isn't
profitable. So if, like me, you use reddit

91
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,219
*all day* it's more than worth a couple bucks
a month.
