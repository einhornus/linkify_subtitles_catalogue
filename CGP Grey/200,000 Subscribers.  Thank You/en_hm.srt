200,000 Subscribers.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,749
Thank you.

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,749
Hi, YouTube.

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,749
Well, that was fast.

5
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,799
At the end of January, I made a video thanking
the first 100,000 subscribers for joining

6
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,379
my channel, and now, just three months later,
the subscribers have been doubled, which is

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,409
an unbelievable rate of growth, so thank you
so much to everyone who's joined up with me

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,449
on this little corner of the internet.

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,589
These last three months have been a crazy,
busy time for me, with too many projects going

10
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,619
on at once, and the next three months will
probably be the same, with more videos and

11
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,249
other stuff on the way.

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,198
One project that's finished now, thanks to
Hank Green, a man who himself runs so many

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,709
different things it's hard to keep track of
them all, is CGP grey shirt, which is now

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,928
available on the DFTBA store.

15
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,799
In case you're wondering, the proceeds of
the shirt will be used to purchase coffee,

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,139
that coffee will fuel the typing and clicking
needed to manufacture videos, videos which

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,369
may contain links to buy the very shirt that
brought them into existence, thus completing

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,509
the circle of life.

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,949
So, go grab one today if you'd like to support
the channel.

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,279
It's been amazing making videos for you, while
watching the channel grow, though now releasing

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,038
each video to so many people is slightly intimidating.

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,669
Even though I take far, far too long researching
each one, I still spend the first few minutes

23
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,239
after uploading living in fear that I've made
some unintentional error and waiting for the

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,828
inevitable comment pointing out where I made
a typo, and there are always typos.

25
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,669
But, terror of errors aside, the nice thing
about having such a large community is being

26
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,389
able to share not only my own stuff with you,
but also other people's videos, either through

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,609
hidden links on my own, or in separate playlists,
like the one I made this week.

28
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,199
Though, on these videos, I've noticed people
often leave comments like, Grey's army coming

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,889
through, and I'm not sure an army is the best
representation of who we are.

30
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,609
I'm more a science and technology guy who
likes reason and simple things that turn complex

31
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,649
in interesting ways, and since you're here
watching these videos, I assume you are as

32
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,649
well.

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,130
I'm not sure what the best collective noun
for this growing community is, but if you

34
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:33,008
have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

35
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,779
Anyway, I'm getting off topic.

36
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,439
You are the reason I can continue to make
these videos.

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,310
Thank you for watching, and thank you for
subscribing.
