00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
The main video is pulling a bit of a trick at this moment.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,019
The rate the advertisers pay per 1000 views is actually a lot higher than this

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,959
and if you own a YouTube channel you can look at your analytics and you'll see a number

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,219
listed that's much bigger per 1000.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,378
This is because there are lots of YouTube views where no ad is shown at all.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,619
If you find that hard to believe it's probably because you're

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,579
in a prime demographic that advertisers want, so you're always seeing ads on YouTube.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,239
But there are demographics that rarely see ads.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,179
Plus, YouTube normally doesn't show someone an ad when they first arrive on the site.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,839
Channels can have 30 or 40%, or as much as 90% of their views play

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,139
without an ad because viewers are in an age or location that fewer advertisers want.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,959
Or, just fewer advertisers happen to be around.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,299
But if you make a YouTube channel, the number you really care about

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,139
is the one that's the size of the check that you get divided by your thousands of views.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,759
This is the number creators compare with each other,

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
even though YouTube doesn't really want us to.
