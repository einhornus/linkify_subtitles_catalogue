1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,732
This is you, this is your family tree and

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,999
this is Your Family Tree Explained.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,365
You have parents, and your parents have

4
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:10,165
parents. These are your grandparents, who also

5
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,332
have parents - your great grandparents.

6
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,565
Keep adding parents, keep adding "greats".

7
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,832
For every "G" in the name there is one

8
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,499
generation in between you and that person.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,832
Grandparents? One "G", one generational

10
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:22,599
in-betweener.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,432
Great, great, great grandparents?

12
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,665
Four G's, four in-betweeners.

13
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,732
Continuing with the basics, you have siblings,

14
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,865
and so do your parents. These are your

15
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:31,832
aunts and uncles.

16
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,199
Up the tree, you may call these people your

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,499
great aunts and uncles, but your grandparent's

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,332
siblings are also your grand aunts and uncles.

19
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,065
Greats are reserved for the levels above grand.

20
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:45,065
Your great grandparents' siblings are your great

21
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:46,765
grandaunts and uncles.

22
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:49,065
Now down the tree, your siblings' children are

23
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:51,765
your nieces and nephews, collectively - niblings,

24
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,599
and you are their aunt or uncle.

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,699
Their children are your grand nieces and

26
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,299
nephews, and you are their grand aunt or uncle.

27
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,265
We've gone up and we've gone down, and it's

28
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,699
time to go sideways.

29
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,332
When you get married, you get everyone's

30
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,632
favorite in-laws. You are on the same level of

31
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,199
the family tree as your spouse's siblings.

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,499
You are kind of "pseudo-sibling". All the new 
families'

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,999
relationsips to you are the same as to your 
spouse,

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,832
but they get the in-law prefix [suffix].

35
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,632
It's pretty straightfoward except for one case:

36
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:20,765
Your spouses' siblings are your siblings-in-law

37
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:23,632
but are your siblings in-law spouses also your

38
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,899
siblings-in-law? It's a little unclear.

39
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,599
Alright, enough with the in-laws, it's onto the 
reason

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,365
you're probably watching this video. Cousins?

41
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,665
Your aunt's and uncle's chidren are your 
cousins, 

42
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,265
but there are many kinds of cousins and to

43
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:35,599
better understand them we need to

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,565
simplify this family tree, and think downward.

45
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,565
Here is you, your children and your 
grandchildren.

46
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:45,065
Your grandchildren are your first cousins to each 
other,

47
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:47,365
and their children, your great grandchildren,

48
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:50,065
are second cousins to each other, and so on.

49
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,799
The cousin number is the same as the "G" rule:

50
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,732
it tells you how many in-betweeners until the 
connection

51
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:56,899
on the family tree.

52
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,532
Fourth cousins? Four in-betweeners, and a 
shared

53
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,599
great, great, great, grandparent.

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,665
According to the rule, your first cousins

55
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,899
and you connect at your grandparent.

56
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,299
And second cousins share a great grandparent

57
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,865
connection.

58
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,632
Just match the cousin number with the number

59
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,932
of G's, and you are all set. Simple!

60
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,532
Side note here: Continuing this rule in reverse,

61
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,865
means that siblings can technically call each

62
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:20,865
other 0th cousins, which they totally should,

63
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:24,499
and you are your own -1 cousin? Weird.

64
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:24,799
(Side note end)

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,999
All done here now, nothing more to talk about ...

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,299
oh right, the once removed thing.

67
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,965
You may have noticed these cousins are on the 
same level.

68
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:35,499
Removed just describes how many generations 
apart people are.

69
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,999
For example: what's the family connection 
between these two?

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,632
Start by taking the smaller cousin number

71
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:44,232
first cousins, and count the levels apart, once 
removed.

72
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:47,432
These are 1st cousins twice removed, thrice removed.

73
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,065
And these are second cousins, once removed.

74
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:52,132
Doing all this on our simplified drawing of your

75
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:55,265
descendence is a bit too easy as most family 
trees look

76
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,432
more like this.

77
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:59,932
The rules are still the same - first cousins, second cousins and the removed,

78
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,999
but it is a bit harder to tell quickly who exactly is

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,999
your second cousin twice removed or your great grandaunts-in-law?

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,699
To help, there is a chart you can download

81
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,865
which will both make it much easier to figure out

82
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:13,532
what grandnibling or cousin removed are to anyone at

83
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:16,265
the next family reunion and obviously, show

84
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,632
how cool you are.

85
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:20,265
Now we're really done. Unless, you start thinking

86
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,765
about the math of all of these family members.

87
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,899
Just how many great, great, great, great granparents

88
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,732
do you have? 64?

89
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:31,899
And those ex-grandparents had kids giving you a whole lot of cousins.

90
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,265
This chart happens to stop at 10th cousins

91
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:37,032
of which you have more than 2,000?

92
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,132
Which seems like way too many,

93
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,432
but these numbers both have big, possibly unsettling asterisks

94
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,465
attached to them, which we will talk about more

95
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:47,099
in Part 2: Family Genetics Explained.
