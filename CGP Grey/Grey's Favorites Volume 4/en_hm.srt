Hello internet!

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,339
I spent the last week working on a video

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,019
about some of my thoughts on the future of education

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,319
and I'm not convinced I did a great job explaining myself

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,459
so I wanted to share with you

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,379
some excellent talks

7
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,919
that go both more broadly and more deeply

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,319
into the kinds of developments in the

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,459
world of education that interests me

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,399
I don't agree with everything in all of these videos

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,779
but I think they all point in the same direction

12
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,079
towards a more interesting future

13
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,059
so click the link to get started

14
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,579
and watch some excellent speakers

15
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,740
and let me know what you think at the end...
