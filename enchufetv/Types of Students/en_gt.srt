1
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:08,951
(The human species, curious by nature...)

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,520
(goes through a stage in its development
known for its harshness and cruelty)

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,018
(Where only the fittest survive.
This stage is known as: )

4
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,644
("the school")

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,695
(There is  a very common kind of
student that experts call "the toilet")

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,880
Teacher can't imagine the traffic there was,
but from tomorrow I swear I'll be there early

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,157
(He always carries an excuse with him)

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,240
My dog died!

9
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:41,670
Wasn't today Saturday?

10
00:00:42,0042 --> 00:00:44,507
Is that halfway I had
to return for the

11
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,180
backpack And the backpack?

12
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,679
(Brute, the backpack!)

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:47,312
M

14
00:00:48,0048 --> 00:00:49,0049
... Ángel Peréz?

15
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:49,925
Present

16
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,740
(A kind of extremely curious student
has been called "Halley's comet")

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,760
(His presence is an event
that few have seen

18
00:00:57,845 --> 00:00:58,885
) Sofía Albán?

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,660
Present

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,260
WHAT?

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,280
What present

22
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:05,0005
? You here?  But if you never come.
What's more, they put his picture all over the school

23
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:06,680
. How is that around here?

24
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:08,667
It's just that the internet went out at

25
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,299
home. Alex Heredia?

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,678
(Unlike the previous specimen,
this one is easy to identify and find

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,880
) M... I'm not going to catch up, it's time to copy

28
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:17,560
Valencia, lend me the duty of mate

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,020
But mate is due after recess, right
now it's history

30
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:21,224
Ah, now.  Cool! 

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,840
(For this species, the words "homework" and "home"
are never related

32
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,668
) W... History duty!

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,760
Shh!  Shut up, it seems that he forgot!

34
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,720
Oh,

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,189
hey, teacher.  You won't forget to check your homework, will you?

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,680
(This species is called "Judas", who for their
own benefit can slaughter the laziest of the herd)

37
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,718
I almost forgot.  You are absolutely right Morales.
He has 2 points more than the partial

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,200
(His academic survival is proportionally inverse
to the socio-affective relationship with his peers

39
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,515
) Son of a [ __ ]...

40
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:53,880
(Who will not hesitate to show him their disagreement)

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,000
(This stage, already hard, is  recognizes
even more thanks to the dreaded exams)

42
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:04,877
(For some this happens as if it were just
about filling the Facebook status)

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,471
(With you, the "dedicated student")

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,823
(There is also the student who
trusts the skills of the rest)

45
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,519
(  He is called "the copycat")

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,940
REMOVE!  REMOVE! 

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,580
REMOVE! 

48
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,298
Remove!  Remove! 

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,233
(For some, the pressure is overwhelming.
This is the case of the "suffering student")

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,0033
(While for others...)

51
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,657
Nah!  I still didn't study

52
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,395
(At recess, there is a type of student known
for keeping food rations for himself)

53
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,968
This one has been called: "comesolito")

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,539
(An underdeveloped species can also be identified.
The typical "bully" with problems  at his house)

55
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,538
(But he's not worth talking about

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,246
) Hey, why?

57
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,058
(The most infallible way to identify
the types of students...

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,681
) Let's see, the grades

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,400
(are the grades)

60
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,533
Valladares

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,140
19

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,840
(For the diligent student, a grade
below outstanding is close to the apocalypse)

63
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:09,543
NO!
My scholarship went to hell!

64
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,735
Perez

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,920
16 Very good!

66
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:17,946
(For the bum, getting a grade that doesn't have a 0
in front of it is a true personal triumph

67
00:03:18,0018 --> 00:03:20,220
) Yes, [ __ ]!  Yes, suck this one!  Yes!

68
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes! 

69
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,925
Sorry, I was wrong. 
This is Edder's grade

70
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:26,200
(And the student whose life is like the 9 times table)

71
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:27,299
16?

72
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,400
One more stripe to the tiger

73
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:31,220
(Not so easy, not so difficult)

74
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,463
Bedoya!
02

75
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:33,330
Again!

76
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,369
At this rate he will repeat the year!
Again! 

77
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,966
(This type of student is called "the eternal")

78
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:41,400
(For whom repeating the course has become an Olympic sport)

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,920
If repetition is the joy

80
00:03:43,0043 --> 00:03:43,885
, yes or what, mijo?

81
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,840
Yes, daddy

82
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,880
(But not everything is pressure during this stage)

83
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,740
(Like for a herd of elephants
that hopefully observe the end of the drought...)

84
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,880
(at some point "holidays" arrive)

85
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:00,868
And well, guys...  It

86
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,946
seems that the last class of the year is over

87
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:16,171
And for the holidays, I need
the algebra exercises from pages 5 to 146 to be solved
