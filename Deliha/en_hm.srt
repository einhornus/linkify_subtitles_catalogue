1
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
Good morning.

2
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,400
What's going on?

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
Sorry, granny. I fell over you.

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,040
It's like we were about to make love.

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
-Shame on you.
-You said it.

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,280
Hey!

7
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,440
Hey.

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
I'm so beautiful.

9
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,480
{\an8}<i>All I did was break a mirror.</i>
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

10
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,360
<i>Put a sock in it!</i>
<i>He's still mouthing off.</i>

11
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,320
What's going on?

12
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
<i>Shut up. Get your car and beat it.</i>

13
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,080
Look, buddy. I'll send you flying.

14
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,320
Hey, I'm having breakfast! Stop shouting!

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,320
Shut up! Get back inside.

16
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
Who are you to park in front of my place?

17
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,440
Who are you? Who are you?

18
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,440
Do you know who I am?

19
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,440
Fato, what's going on?

20
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,560
The water guy parked his car
in front of Tayyar's place.

21
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,400
Tayyar got pissed off
and broke the car mirror. That prick!

22
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,080
The water guy asked why he did it.

23
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,080
Tayyar told the water guy
to forgive and forget.

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,640
The water guy said "why?"
and called him a prick and a dog.

25
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
Fatma...

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,480
You're getting seriously foul-mouthed.

27
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,000
Clean it up a little. Shame on you.

28
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,560
Let me go! Let me get him!
OK, just let me go!

29
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,720
I've had it with you. Come on, have a go.

30
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,400
-Grab him, grab him.
-Come on. Come on.

31
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,200
Shut your mouth. Get going.

32
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,480
<i>He's still mouthing off.</i>
<i>You know how I get when I'm mad.</i>

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
<i>Hey!</i>

34
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,440
<i>What is it?</i>

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,200
What happened?
You were mouthing off? Now scram.

36
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,600
-Tayyar!
-Huh?

37
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,200
Did I get burned?

38
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,800
I got burned!

39
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,440
Because of you!

40
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,320
All because of you.

41
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,079
You just wait, Deliha.

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm burning!

43
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
I hate trouble in the neighborhood.

44
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,000
You scorched the boy's family jewel!
You scorched the poor kid's future!

45
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,200
What else could I do, Havva?

46
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,640
They were locked together.

47
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,400
Should I have let them become welded?

48
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,120
Anyway, it wasn't boiling.

49
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,000
It was between tepid and boiling.

50
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,080
And he's my cousin.
He bugs me. What's it to you?

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,200
What are they, Zehlia, a couple of dogs?
What do you mean, locked together?

52
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,360
-Enough of that. Are we going?
-We're going.

53
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,160
Let me put on my lipstick
and I'll be ready.

54
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,080
I'm telling you, we shouldn't go.

55
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,200
-It's a sin. We'll pay for it.
-It's at my peril then.

56
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
It's at my peril, Havva.

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,520
Hey, deadbeat!

58
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,040
I want to think about whelps today.

59
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,000
-What the hell's a whelp?
-A puppy.

60
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,200
Be downstairs in three minutes.

61
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,360
Fix that.

62
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,040
I can't.

63
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,000
Fix it, I said. My nerves are shot.

64
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,680
-It's so hot.
-Don't suck up my energy, mom.

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,840
-I have important stuff to do.
-Like what?

66
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,000
It's private.

67
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,080
-Give me some money.
-I don't have any.

68
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,760
I need to borrow from your aunt.

69
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,920
It must be 40 degrees.

70
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,480
We don't have a man around.

71
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,560
A woman going out on her own, my, oh my!

72
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,760
-I'll throw this slipper at you.
-I'll hang you by your ears.

73
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,760
Shut up, that's my line.

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,840
You burned the tablecloth again.

75
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,440
It's a lousy tablecloth.

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,120
Mom, you look a real wreck.

77
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,160
You missed.

78
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,280
granny, I'm taking some money. Forgive me.

79
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
It's 100, OK?

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,400
I've taken 150.

81
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm going to a fortune-teller.
I'll get yours read too.

82
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,680
Maybe you'll get lucky. Who knows?

83
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,400
Don't worry, there'll still be enough
to get you a shroud. I'll pay it back.

84
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,120
Now say you forgive me.

85
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,920
May your prayers be answered, granny.

86
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm off.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,240
Oh, my God. She fell.

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,640
God, if I'm downstairs in ten seconds,
let me meet the love of my life. Amen.

89
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Out the way!

90
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,680
Shame on you.

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,680
I made it.

92
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,360
Come on. Step on it.

93
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,040
How's it going?

94
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
I really pity these guys.

95
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,160
They're more and more
in love with me every day.

96
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,240
What a wacko.

97
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,520
Yeah, right. We're so in love.

98
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,520
Are you crazy?

99
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,040
Go on, keep moving. I hit you by mistake.

100
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
I don't think much of her or her mother.

101
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,080
Her mother kicked her mother-in-law
out to the street.

102
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,520
Thank God,
her brother came and rescued her.

103
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,760
Such a shame.

104
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,280
Kids!

105
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,160
That's enough.
You want me to slash your ball?

106
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,800
Why do you give me such grief?
Give me that ball quick.

107
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,720
Davut! Hand it over.

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
Give it to me. Come here.

109
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,560
The neighborhood thinks you're "loose".
Thought you should know.

110
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,880
Get going.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
-Get to it.
-Thanks, Zeliha.

112
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,720
-Good day, Eftoptia.
-You too, you crazy girl.

113
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,440
-Good morning, Samim.
-Good morning.

114
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,040
-Good morning, Kasım.
-Good morning, sweetie.

115
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,920
-I got you a cassette. Here.
-Thanks.

116
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,040
Thank you.

117
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,880
It'll work soon.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
-I'll get it to work.
-I hope so.

119
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,320
-Hang lose.
-Will do.

120
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,799
Zeliha, isn't it “hang loose”?

121
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,559
Some say “loose”, some “lose”.
“Lose” is right. You should know that.

122
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,039
-So, you're opening a studio?
-We'll see if we can.

123
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,600
I guess we'll be
the last ever photo studio to open.

124
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,640
Come on now! He's number two.

125
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
-So you're number one?
-No, not like that.

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
One day he said
he was going to study photography.

127
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,080
I told him not to bother.
Photos aren't something you study.

128
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,000
Photos are something you take.
He didn't listen.

129
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,760
When he graduated
I thought we may as well open a studio.

130
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,640
But I never wanted a studio.
Who goes to studios anyway?

131
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,800
-Everyone takes photos on their phones.
-Don't back out. We talked about this.

132
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
Feeling a photo in your hand
is something else.

133
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,040
-Seeing it on a screen leaves me cold.
-Feeling it is much better.

134
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,840
-That's right. Exactly.

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,240
-Go on, take my picture.
-What's that?

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,240
You mean you don't know?
Just center it and press the button.

137
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,360
Take it, sonny. Go for it.

138
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,440
Here.

139
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,320
What kind of a photo is that?

140
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,720
My five-year-old nephew can do this.
What makes you special?

141
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,760
Five, that's great.

142
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,080
STUDIO NECO

143
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,240
This is it.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,640
Tell my fortune.

145
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,000
That's old-fashioned.
Let's do a reincarnation session.

146
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,080
I'll tell you who you were
in your past life.

147
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
I don't care who I was back then.

148
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,880
Tell me about my love life right now.

149
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,480
What a bore.

150
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,200
-Name?
-Zeliha.

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
-Day, month, year?
-March 13th.

152
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
1988. Anything else?

153
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,440
-That's all I need.
-And I'm a Leo.

154
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,360
-No, you're a Pisces.
-I'm a Leo.

155
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,920
No, a Pisces. Your ascendant is Leo
and your moon sign Scorpio.

156
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,720
I'm not a Pisces.

157
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
Pisces are emotional.
What's emotional about me? Dickhead.

158
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,080
What a jerk.

159
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,120
Both your mom and grandma are alive.

160
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,080
Your dad's dead. He was a truck driver.

161
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,600
You grew up like a boy. Mom's in
menopause, granny's not all there.

162
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,520
There's nobody special in your life.

163
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,520
There never has been.
You've only had platonic love.

164
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
You've loved, but haven't been loved back.

165
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,560
-You've always been a loser.
-Girl.

166
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,560
He knows everything. I'm in shock.

167
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
-He got some things right.
-He said you were a loser.

168
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
-I swear he knows everything.
-Hey, Fatma.

169
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
I swear I'll smash your face in.
Zip it!

170
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
You're a spinster.

171
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,920
Mr. Fortune-teller,

172
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,880
could we not say that?
Can we say I'm choosy?

173
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,560
No, your cousins always
talk behind your back.

174
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,880
It's Dürdane, isn't it?
My aunt's girl. My cousin.

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,720
She has thyroid issues.
She can't lose weight.

176
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,600
Shut up. What do I care?

177
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,800
Tell me my future, mate!
Go on, tell my future.

178
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,600
In a previous life
you were a Bedouin in Egypt.

179
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,720
What's that?

180
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,440
There's a guy you like
in your neighborhood.

181
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,440
He's short, a baby face.

182
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,440
And in a previous life

183
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,200
you were an Amazon warrior.

184
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
You don't like fortune-telling.

185
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Sorry, I just got that information.
Pardon me.

186
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
You.

187
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,760
You write weird songs.
And in a previous life...

188
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,160
-You were a horse.
-I'm not into horses.

189
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,240
Are you doing this on purpose?

190
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,920
Are you trying to annoy me?
I came to have my fortune told.

191
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Do mine. Do my fortune, not theirs.

192
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,000
There's no telling what you were.

193
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,280
I don't care! I am what I am.

194
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,600
Is that what I asked?

195
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,280
Am I going to fall in love? Huh?
Is someone going to love me?

196
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
How do I know? It's up to fate.

197
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,720
Look, buddy.

198
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
Why did I come here? Huh?

199
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,320
You're a horse, a butterfly.
What do I care?

200
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,160
Tell me about my love life.

201
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,600
I'll poke out your eyes.

202
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
-There'll be someone soon.
-Who?

203
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,480
Someone new.
You fall in love. Then marriage.

204
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,280
Who? Who?

205
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,040
I see the letters C, M, L.

206
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,920
C, M, L.

207
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,880
-Like, Selim?
-C, M, L.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,680
-Davut?
-"C, M, L," I said.

209
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,760
-When will I fall in love?
-In ten days, two weeks.

210
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,440
-There was a fly.
-I know, that information came.

211
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,640
Wow!

212
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Boys, here's your shop.

213
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,400
Clean it up, and start snapping.

214
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,280
Is there a dark room somewhere?

215
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,280
No, no way. The whole place gets light.

216
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
It's clean and airy.

217
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,040
We're talking past each other.

218
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,200
Now, the handsome one is Cemil
and the ugly one Cemal.

219
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,400
You're older, right?

220
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,440
Yes, I'm, but I wish
you hadn't said “ugly”.

221
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,440
Why do you have an accent,
but he doesn't?

222
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,360
Cemil's a city boy. He went to
high school and university here.

223
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,920
-I stayed in Şirince.
-Şirince? Never heard of it.

224
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,760
What? You know, where everyone ran
when the world was going to end.

225
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,400
-Well? It didn't end.
-But it could have.

226
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
We grow grapes there.

227
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,800
Grapes? What kind? Black or white?

228
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,480
Green. But like this, huge.

229
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,320
The big ones are something
and the round ones something else.

230
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
Especially the big hard ones.

231
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,800
But our real specialty is peaches.
Freestone and juicy.

232
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,680
Bro, stop fanning the flames.
What are you doing?

233
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
-Real juicy peaches, huh?
-You bet.

234
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,240
Like honey.

235
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,840
Some like them fuzzy,
others like them smooth.

236
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
I like both kinds.

237
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,080
-The guy sure loves fruit.
-Yeah, right.

238
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,760
Boys, come in and have a look.

239
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,560
This is it. This is just the place.

240
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,720
Stick a mattress in here, just in case.

241
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
No, I don't take naps.

242
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,160
Napping at your age?

243
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,640
To make love.

244
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,440
-We don't intend to do that.
-Intentions are important.

245
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,360
-Take me, I'm always up for it.
-On for what?

246
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,120
I'm talking about women.

247
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,040
White-skinned ones. Like grapes.

248
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,400
Is this it? Where's the kitchen and stuff?

249
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,640
There's no kitchen.

250
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,080
But I have a counter top at home.
It's as big as this shop.

251
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,720
Really? What do you do
with a counter that size?

252
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
-I beat meat.
-Can it have it?

253
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,720
Sure. If not, I make up for it.

254
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,600
Bro, let's think about it.

255
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,840
Don't decide until you see the bathroom.

256
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,120
Let me show you.

257
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,920
Let's not decide until we've seen it.

258
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,480
Look.

259
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,840
Wow, look at that.

260
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,720
Great, isn't it? Look.

261
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,720
You go through here,
and up here. You sit here.

262
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
You do it like a king.

263
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,600
We'll take it! It's taken.

264
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,520
Yeah, “taken” is right.

265
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,360
Who's C, M, L?
If it's Hasan, there's no “C.”

266
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
-Fortune-telling's a sin.
-You're done in?

267
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,000
It's a sin, a sin.

268
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,320
Fortune-telling is like a funeral.
You shoulder the casket...

269
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,560
Shut up. You're such a downer.

270
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,760
-Why are we friends with him?
-He doesn't have any others.

271
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,280
Now I feel bad.

272
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,080
-Zeliha!
-What?

273
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,240
Hey!

274
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,760
-Look, look.
-What?

275
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,240
OK, it's nice, but black would be better.

276
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm talking about the license plate.

277
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,040
34 C, M, L... Ah, the love of my life!

278
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,280
I'm going to fall in love on the spot.

279
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,560
Oh, my God.

280
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,040
It's an old man.

281
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,240
-What's your name, old man?
-Sıtkı.

282
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,840
-Sıtkı?
-Yes.

283
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,720
Bugger off! Go on, get going.

284
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,760
Munching on a burger! Get going!

285
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,760
The rat.

286
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,520
-Good luck to us, Cemil.
-It's all done, Cemil.

287
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,920
It's for my brother's sake.

288
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,200
Otherwise why open a shop
that'll go bust in two days?

289
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,240
You know best, bro.

290
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,760
Mom said to open a shop for you.

291
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,920
She wanted you to have
a roof over your head.

292
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,120
But if you don't want it,
let's go to Şirince.

293
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,480
OK, whatever.

294
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,560
But what's with the landlord
taking three months in advance?

295
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,920
What could the guy do? He needs cash.

296
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,520
-They're all a bunch of crooks.
-Did you know I'm the landlord?

297
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
What?

298
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,920
The guy pranked us.

299
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,240
-Why are you telling us now?
-So I get the commission.

300
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,440
If you want commission
we're not renting it.

301
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,440
You signed. There's a contract.

302
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,080
What a relief.

303
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,720
-The place was empty for two years.
-Hang on.

304
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,640
You said someone moved out last week.

305
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,520
Who said that? Me?

306
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,800
Unbelievable!

307
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,120
I know what we should do.

308
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,720
We'll both lie down here
so you can screw us again.

309
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
-What?
-Never mind.

310
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,840
He's just kidding.

311
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,080
Let's go to the bank.
What kind of talk is that? Watch it.

312
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,240
Come with me a second.

313
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,440
I have to make a quick stop.

314
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,079
Efshopshia, Efshopshia.

315
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,839
Efpraxia. That's my name.

316
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,800
OK, what did I say?
Didn't I say, "Efshopshia?"

317
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,160
-What happened to my money?
-The rent's only a week late.

318
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,839
If it's late again
I'll have to evict you, babe.

319
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,520
What are you talking about?
Where would I go?

320
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
I could tear down this building
and put up a condo.

321
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
-What?
-A condo.

322
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,920
That has a certain ring to it.

323
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Deliha! Crazy girl!

324
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
My name's Zeliha, not Deliha.

325
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,000
Is he trying to evict you too, Efkoptia?

326
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,120
-He says he'll evict me.
-What's that supposed to mean?

327
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,480
Who do you think you're evicting?

328
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,400
She's been here forever.
Nobody can kick her out.

329
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,200
Why are you talking like her?

330
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,560
You'll evict this woman over my dead body.

331
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,440
Do you understand?

332
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,440
Half the neighborhood is mine.
So is your flat actually.

333
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,280
I'll evict you all one by one if I want.

334
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,720
You're not going to evict shit.

335
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,080
You'll all end up moving
whether you like it or not.

336
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
Hey!

337
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,720
I didn't get to bite him!

338
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,720
Don't let her out without a leash.
She'll bite a child!

339
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,440
-Let me go! Let me get a bite!
-Whoa!

340
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,640
You rat!

341
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,240
I hope they drag you to the mountains
and screw you until your ass falls off.

342
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,480
I hope everyone has their way with you.

343
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,320
-Who's that girl, Faik?
-The neighborhood nutcase.

344
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,520
-You bastard!
-But I fancy her mother.

345
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,200
She sure is sassy.
Girls like her are rare these days.

346
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,480
-What?
-I hope horses have a go, too.

347
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,160
The bank, before it closes.

348
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
What do you mean, horses? Huh?

349
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,240
I said the wrong curse. Let me go.

350
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,440
You dog. Dog!

351
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,840
Rat! Let me go.

352
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,600
Zeliha. Look, he's gone.

353
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,640
Calm down. He's gone. Sit down.

354
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,640
Calm down.

355
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,080
Hey! What's going on?

356
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,560
-Mind your business, baby face.
-Faik, Zeliha, her home...

357
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,840
There's a fake Zeliha at home?
What are you talking about?

358
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,840
Faik's evicting Zeliha's family.

359
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,920
-Ah. Well, so be it.
-I'll punch you in the nose.

360
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,280
Serves you right. Why did you scald me?
I'm still burning in certain places.

361
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,760
I'd rather be cousins
with an animal than you. Pussy!

362
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,480
Man up and protect your cousin.

363
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,200
Watch your mouth.

364
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,320
Tayyar, make an ugly face!

365
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,920
I told you, don't do that.

366
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,360
I'm still mad as hell.
I'm going to bust up that realtor's ass.

367
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,240
GÜVEN REAL ESTATE

368
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,160
Ugh! What's going on?

369
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,800
Whoa!

370
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Whoa.

371
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Who are you? Do you work here?

372
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,200
We're renting the shop from Faik.

373
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,240
Which shop?

374
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,120
The one in the square. Studio Neco.

375
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,720
-Studio Neco?
-Yeah.

376
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,840
Ah.

377
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,120
Mate, I have an issue.

378
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,080
So I came to wreck the shop. You know...

379
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,160
I was going to head-butt everything.
Maybe smash a desk with my elbow.

380
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,520
Or maybe a flying kick.

381
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,240
But you're new here.

382
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,440
And, whoa...

383
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,800
You're pretty good-looking.

384
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,520
Out of respect for you,
I'll wreck this joint another time.

385
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,720
I see.

386
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,440
-What's your name?
-Cemil.

387
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,480
OK, Cemil, see you.

388
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,080
-What was your name again?
-Cemil.

389
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,560
C, M, L.

390
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,000
So?

391
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,440
-Meeting you pleased me.
-What was that?

392
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,840
Want to dance tomorrow?
You, me, the three of us?

393
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,320
-What dance?
-Uncle Kadir's getting married.

394
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,320
Who's Uncle Kadir? I can't keep up.

395
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,440
Don't you like dancing?
I like leading the dance.

396
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,840
Huh?

397
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,800
I've got some foot on the stove.
Don't want it to overflow.

398
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,680
See you ladder.

399
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,240
Good grief.

400
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,160
Zeliha?

401
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,600
-Hello.
-Hello.

402
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,080
-Where did Faik go?
-To the bank for a short visit.

403
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,840
-Who's short? You calling me short?
-I mean he won't be long.

404
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,760
So you're tall and I'm short. Is that it?

405
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
Faik's just down the street.
He'll be back shorty.

406
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,880
I mean, shortly.
You're messing with my head.

407
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,360
Shorty, huh?

408
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,120
Well, camels are tall, too!

409
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,560
Camels are tall, too!

410
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,520
OK.

411
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,560
No problem. Whatever you say.

412
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,160
What kind of neighborhood is this?

413
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,920
I had a dream last night.
I hope it bodes well.

414
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,080
There was a herd of horses running.

415
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,520
But then I saw their hooves
were wrapped in cloth.

416
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,080
I thought, "How can they run like that?"

417
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,400
It means your luck's dried up.

418
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,880
Shh.

419
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,840
Then the horses see me
and start galloping toward me.

420
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm asking myself
if they're really running toward me,

421
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,080
when I see Zeliha on a horse.

422
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,040
I start running away and then wake up.

423
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
-I hope it bodes well.
-I hope so.

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,200
I can't figure that out.
It sure is a strange dream.

425
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,600
God forbid, could it mean
Zeliha is going to go astray?

426
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,920
Songül, you always put
a bad spin on things.

427
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,320
I've half a mind to get up
and chuck this slipper at you.

428
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
Sweetie.

429
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,400
Now that takes the cake.

430
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,800
Your husband's right to go off you.

431
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,840
Who said he went off me?

432
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,560
He turns his back on you in bed.
That's what you told Aysel.

433
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,840
Aysel!

434
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,440
What? When did I say that?

435
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,360
Aysel, you called last week
and said Songül's not getting any.

436
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,040
-Didn't you say the poor man's right?
-She did. She did.

437
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,000
I have a witness.

438
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,440
I'm in love.

439
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
Honey bun, I'm in love!

440
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,640
Mom! I'm in love.

441
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Auntie, I'm in love.

442
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,040
Auntie Makbule, get him for me.

443
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,920
Hen party, engagement, wedding.
Fix them all right away.

444
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,720
Decide what you're wearing
at the wedding. I'm in love.

445
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,720
The bride arrived on horseback.

446
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,040
We need to talk.

447
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
I can't look you in the eye.

448
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,920
But...

449
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,320
I have to say it.

450
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
Baby...

451
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,680
I'm in love with somebody else.

452
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,240
Just listen. Don't say anything.

453
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,600
We went to a fortune-teller.
He said I'd fall in love

454
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,000
with someone
whose name has the letters C, M, L.

455
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,120
Cemil.

456
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,880
What did I say the day I put you up?

457
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,240
I told you not to trust me.

458
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,600
You should have grabbed me
while you had the chance.

459
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,200
No, don't. You'll be happy, too.

460
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,160
You'll fall in love with someone else.

461
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,840
Anyway, our relationship
has worn you out, too.

462
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,920
You're torn at the edges.

463
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,160
And granny gets embarrassed
when you watch her do her prayers.

464
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
We always cover your face.

465
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,240
It'll be easier if you don't look.
In the name of God...

466
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,480
You only have one eye left.

467
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,600
Goodbye, Kenan.

468
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,000
Welcome, Cemil.

469
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,480
Good morning.

470
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,120
Good morning, honey bun.

471
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,440
I'm so happy.

472
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,200
Havva! Havva!

473
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Havva!

474
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,040
-What happened, Zeliha?
-Be downstairs in three minutes.

475
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,160
Hey!

476
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,600
Who broke this window?

477
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,840
Me.

478
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,640
People go all funny
when they fall in love.

479
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,160
What happened?

480
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,360
People go all funny
when they fall in love.

481
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,520
You have no shame!

482
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,600
-So you want plain white.
-That's right, plain and white.

483
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Shall I paint a few roses?
They'd look great.

484
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,440
No, thanks. No need for a design.

485
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,920
How about some tiny wildflowers?

486
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,080
-That would be amazing.
-Just plain...

487
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,000
Why are you against it?
Let the guy do tiny flowers.

488
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,120
If this were a grandpa's house,
not a studio, OK.

489
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,040
How about some pink cameras?
It would be meaningful.

490
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,000
You don't get it. Let me explain again.

491
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,160
You're to paint the wall
all one color, OK?

492
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,160
I already don't want this shop,
don't make it worse.

493
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,400
-Sure you don't want flowers?
-Yes. No flowers.

494
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,080
Just paint it white. That's all.

495
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,600
-Birds?
-Birds?

496
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,720
Ugh...

497
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,000
Still the goddamn birds and bees...

498
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,040
-Who does he think he is?
-He only thinks of himself.

499
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,280
Oh, my goodness.

500
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,480
-Something's happened.
-What is it?

501
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,360
-Something's happened to you.
-No. What is supposed to have happened?

502
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,840
-Why did you run off yesterday?
-I didn't. Why would I do that?

503
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,320
You were talking to some guy,
then you ran off.

504
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,680
Cemil?

505
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,680
No. No, it's nothing.

506
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,840
Mom called me. There's a guy she likes.

507
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,640
She texted him. But he didn't reply.

508
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,760
She said we should
blow on the phone together.

509
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,120
Don't lie, Zeliha. Tell me the truth.

510
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,840
You like that guy. Was it Cemil?

511
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,480
-Right.
-Cemil?

512
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,680
Cemil.

513
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,800
C, M, L.

514
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,360
-Is that Cemil?
-Who's Cemil?

515
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,160
-She's walking away.
-The auntie?

516
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,600
-Is she an auntie?
-Yes.

517
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,040
She looks just like Cemil.

518
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,920
Why did you call me here?

519
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,880
To catch some fresh air. Come on,
I know a great place for some air.

520
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,680
-What are we doing here?
-Nothing. Getting some air.

521
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,440
Why do we keep looking over there?

522
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,000
-I'm not looking anywhere.
-That's it. Enough. Just plain white.

523
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,040
Cemil's having the place painted.

524
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,080
-That guy! He's renting the shop.
-So they say.

525
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
-Let's go wish them luck.
-No.

526
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Let him come to us.

527
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,600
Listen.

528
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,120
If I reach that leaf, Cemil says “hi.”
But as a friend.

529
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,920
-OK?
-Yes.

530
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,880
I can't reach it.

531
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
What are you looking at?

532
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,360
-What's she doing?
-You see that girl? She's so spunky.

533
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,840
-The dark one jumping up and down?
-Yes.

534
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,560
She's crazy.

535
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,200
Well, I fancy her.

536
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,200
-Is he looking over here?
-Not at all.

537
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,560
-I think he is, but you won't say.
-Zeliha, why wouldn't I?

538
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,760
-He's looking.
-Swear on it.

539
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,440
How many times did he look?
Was it three, five?

540
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,560
Was it a look of love?

541
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,120
Did his look say “come”
or did it say “go”?

542
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,600
Tell me!

543
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,320
OK, you're getting carried away.

544
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,120
I'll go in the shop and wish him luck.
What's the big deal?

545
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,080
Good grief.

546
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,680
The barn door's open.

547
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,080
I meant the shop door.

548
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,600
Where'd you find the shop?

549
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,600
Which shop?

550
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,160
Have you ever been married?

551
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,400
-What am I saying?
-What's she saying?

552
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't know,
but she's a straightforward type of girl.

553
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,640
I'm Zeliha. We met at the realtor's.

554
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
-I remember.
-We met too.

555
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,480
You know, there was that fight
at the Greek lady's house.

556
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,880
-How are you settling in?
-The wall.

557
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's a good neighborhood.
Everyone likes each other.

558
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,400
There are some I don't like.

559
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,560
Our women are in menopause.

560
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
They've got big bums
from all the carbohydrates.

561
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,280
The men are constantly being hen-pecked.

562
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,000
My mom sweats a lot.
That's from the menopause.

563
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,000
My love life sucks.

564
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,240
I've never had a boyfriend.

565
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,080
Kenan and I split up last night.
We'll talk about that later.

566
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,160
-Yeah, but the wall. Your hand...
-It's nice and smooth.

567
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,640
It's wet. It was just painted.

568
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,920
Huh?

569
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,600
Oh, my God!

570
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,560
I thought it was just damp.

571
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,280
There goes your face too.

572
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,760
Oh my!

573
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,080
It doesn't matter.

574
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,320
I look good in white.

575
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,080
They say it suits me.

576
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,880
Like a wedding dress maybe. Huh?

577
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,040
I'd even look good in a shroud.

578
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,440
What is this?
Do you have no respect for art?

579
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,240
-Shh, OK.
-What are you yelling about?

580
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,800
Did anything happen?

581
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,440
-You ruined the wall.
-Normally...

582
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,840
I'd knock this guy to the ground
and step on his face.

583
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,520
But you've just arrived,
so that would be shameful.

584
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,040
One day I'll come

585
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,040
and walk all over him.

586
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,920
-Why is your face all white?
-My blood pressure dropped.

587
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,640
No, it really is white.

588
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,560
-I'm all white.
-Why are you pouting?

589
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,120
Am I pouting?

590
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,440
I am. I guess I'm upset.

591
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,440
I'll go get Fatma.
We can meet in the park, OK?

597
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,360
OK, I'm coming.

598
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,200
Step on it, guys.

599
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,240
-She fell for this guy.
-Which guy?

600
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,040
The new guy, Cemil or whoever.
She won't admit it.

601
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,280
Love is like frog's legs.
All wet and floppy.

602
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,440
Fevzi, quiet.

603
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,560
Fatma, she got so excited
she got paint all over herself.

604
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,880
-Is he interested in her?
-What do you think?

605
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,640
The fortune-teller said C, M, L.

606
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,120
That's “Cemil”.

607
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,800
Fevzi, give me a push.

608
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,600
-Zeliha.
-What?

609
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,640
-Are you OK?
-I'm fine.

610
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,280
Is there anything you'd like to share?

611
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,280
No.

612
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,240
-I have a question.
-Don't ask, she won't answer.

613
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,440
Zeliha.

614
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,160
Did you fall for that boy?

615
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,520
Zeliha!

616
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,160
Are you OK, Zeliha?

617
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,840
I'm fine.

618
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,440
Yes, I'm interested in Cemil.
I might be in love.

619
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,480
-How could it happen so quick?
-He's my destiny.

620
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,840
My fate. I understand these things.
What's more...

621
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,160
He's dark and I'm fair.
We're the perfect match.

622
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,080
And I think he loves me.

623
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,560
When our eyes meet,

624
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,440
the seas move, the mountains dry up.
Even my mouth dries up.

625
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,720
But no boy's ever loved you before.

626
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,720
I hope five men
drag you off to the mountains.

627
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,080
God help us. God preserve us.

628
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,360

-Eat.
-No, mom.

00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,719
I've gone off food. Love does that.

Don't try to kill yourself this time.

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,400
No way. This time he loves me back.

Cemil.

642
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,440
They took over Studio Neco's.
We're making eyes at each other.

643
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,880
Does making eyes do it?

-I want to make an announcement.
-Are you going to propose?

686
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,480
-No, speak to the neighborhood.
-Fine, jump in.

687
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,920
-Talk like this, OK?
-I know, I saw it in the movies.

688
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,600
Thanks. I hope the police
never give you trouble.

689
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,760
Amen to that.

690
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,240
Dear residents of our neighborhood.

691
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,520
We're opening Studio Neco today.

692
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,440
<i>We hope to see you on this special day.</i>

693
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,360
<i>Would you like to see us too?</i>

694
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,560
<i>I can almost hear you say yes.</i>

695
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,920
<i>A fresh take on photos: Studio Neco.</i>
<i>Studio Neco, now serving you.</i>

696
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,360
What did he say?

697
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,040
He said today is the best day
to live love to the hilt.

698
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,520
-What was that?
-We're living love to the hilt today.

699
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,840
Ah! Pervert.

700
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,440
Dig in and enjoy.

701
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Stick her between
two slices of bread and eat her up.

702
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,000
FREE PHOTO FOR OPENING DAY

703
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,640
-Is that the violinist?
-What does it look like?

704
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,160
He's playing gypsy tunes.
We need some classics.

705
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,360
Why do you always find fault?
Let's ask him. He'll do it.

706
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,520
Can you play something more classical?

707
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,920
Certainly. "Miss You" by Selami Şahin?

708
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,920
-Really? Go ahead.
-Great.

709
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
What's this?

710
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,320
-Take it easy, Kasım.
-Thanks.

711
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,800
-What are you looking at?
-Just taking in the view.

712
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,320
Oh, no.

713
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,280
Best of luck.

714
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,360
Best of luck.

715
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,920
-Our lips almost touched.
-Uh-huh.

716
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,120
This is Fevzi. He's a deadbeat.
Shake hands, Fevzi.

717
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
-Hello.
-Hello.

718
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,000
-This is Fatma, our spinster.
-No, my dear.

719
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,600
I can't really say that.

720
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,320
A fireman asked for my hand
just last month. I refused.

721
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,080
He'd been married twice.
Am I to take care of an old man?

722
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,400
-Deal with his prostate problems?
-Right. You should be in love.

723
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,160
-Uh-huh.
-This is Havva. She's dumb, but nice.

724
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,880
That's Cemil. You already know him.

725
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,360
Cemil's great.

726
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,280
He's so handsome.

727
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,560
-Cemal.
-Yes.

728
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,120
What a beautiful cat.

729
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,040
He's so handsome, Havva.

730
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,400
I mean, real handsome.

731
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,080
So young and strong.
And those dark eyes.

732
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,160
His eyes make you go all funny inside.

733
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,640
You feel like stroking his hair

734
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,320
on a sheepskin in front of a fire...

735
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,560
-Naked, for hours...
-Cemil.

736
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,040
-I'm having my photo taken.
-Go right in.

737
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,040
-Zeliha, you really hit on him.
-No, I didn't.

738
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,120
Play it cool and slap him down.

739
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,720
Guys don't like girls who are too forward.

740
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,480
Slap him down, huh?

741
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,080
Smile, he's taking our photo.

742
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,600
-Missy Sisi.
-She's not up for it today.

743
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,520
She normally smiles.

744
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,720
If you're done, I'm ready.

745
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,440
-Come on!
-Well, anyway.

746
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,880
-Are you having your photo taken?
-Yeah. Isn't that your job, mutt?

747
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,080
-Pop that flash.
-OK, turn to the right.

748
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,320
Don't order me around.
Who do you think you are, dickhead?

749
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,600
-But you're being shameful.
-Shameful, up yours blameful.

750
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,520
Take it!

751
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,080
-Take one like this, idiot.
-Don't talk to me like that.

752
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,640
What's wrong?
Hurt your feelings? Oaf!

753
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,120
For goodness' sake.

754
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,920
Everyone's here. Nobody told me.

755
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,560
Best of luck. What are you doing?
Handing round lemonade?

756
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,000
There we go.

757
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,000
-Tayyar.
-What are you up to, ducky?

758
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,320
-Last night was nice.
-You want some ice?

759
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,040
Last night, when you kissed my cheek.

760
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,280
Oh? I kissed you?

761
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm something else. Hey, listen up,

762
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,320
I cornered her last night.

763
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,640
I don't remember a thing.

764
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,640
Watch out, I'll plant a kiss on you.

765
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,120
-I'll never forgive you.
-What? What was that?

766
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,760
I'll never forgive you.

767
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,400
Havva, stop kidding around. Forgive me.

768
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,520
I won't forgive you!

769
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,240
-You rat.
-Oh, my God!

770
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,120
-Dirty rat.
-What's going on?

771
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,160
Hey.

772
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,240
I'm supposed to slap him down.
What are you doing?

773
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,760
-I think I hurt his feelings.
-You didn't spoil him, did you?

774
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,440
-I called him a mutt.
-A mutt? Whoa!

775
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,800
-Whoa!
-He deserved it. The dirty dog.

776
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,320
And all his filthy language.

777
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,480
Did someone put cologne in her lemonade?

778
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,920
-Hey, Havva. Is he looking?
-No.

779
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,440
Stop looking at Tayyar.
He's never going to marry you.

780
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,640
He's a womanizing scumbag.
Keep your eye on Cemil.

781
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,280
I'll go up to him
the second I get an inviting look.

782
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,280
What are you looking at?

783
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,800
-He told me to come.
-No, he didn't.

784
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,240
I saw him say, “Come, come.”

785
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,640
OK. Thanks. See you.

786
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,360
What are you doing?

787
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,320
-I splat at you.
-You did what?

788
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,720
I splat.

789
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,080
-Come on, baby, let's make up.
-Did we fall out?

790
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,320
I made you mad.

791
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Hey, my dark-eyed, honey-lipped baby.
Come here, cutie.

792
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,640
What are you saying, sonny?
Leave me alone.

793
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,680
Sonny?

794
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,240
Zeliha!

795
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,720
Spin it. Spin it round.

796
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,600
Keep spinning.

797
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,560
-He called me "sonny".
-What's the big deal?

798
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,120
Shut up and spin it.

799
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,800
He doesn't want me.

800
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,520
-He called me “sonny” like the others.
-That dirty rat.

801
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,080
Nobody will love me.
I'm going to die all alone.

802
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,320
Not this time, Zeliha!

803
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,840
We're here. Who's he anyway?

804
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,120
Who do these guys think they are?

805
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,840
We'll go to battle if we have to.

806
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,000
-We're meeting in the park tomorrow.
-What for?

807
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,320
-The Zeliha Movement!
-Whoa.

808
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,920
We're starting, Zeliha.

809
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,040
If Cemil doesn't fall in love with you,
my name's not Havva.

810
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,920
She's finally speaking up.
Is she possessed?

811
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,120
-We see it on the news.
-Shut up and listen.

812
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,320
Plan one: go everywhere Cemil goes.
Act like it's a coincidence.

813
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,840
-Like, "Oh, are you here too?"
-OK.

814
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,160
-What's up, Cemil?
-Fine.

815
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,440
I'm just here to work up a sweat.

816
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,360
Have a good one.

817
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,680
Thanks.

818
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,160
How's it going, Cemil?

819
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,720
We go to the same barber.
See that? What a coincidence.

820
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,720
Cavit, I want to get my eyebrows done.

821
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,840
Kick it!

822
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,640
Hello.

823
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,320
-How's it going, Cemil?
-Fine.

824
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,400
Come on, right down the middle.

825
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,640
That's it. Come on.

826
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,840
Whoa! Whoa!

827
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,760
Goal!

828
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,760
Good on you!

829
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,800
Didn't I tell you to go

830
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,080
to places where men and women go?

831
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,360
What do I know?

832
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,320
I was so busy watching the match
I forgot all about him.

833
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,000
You should go to the cinema.

834
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,760
Have some popcorn. Go on. It's good.

835
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,520
What are you doing?

836
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,280
BABY PEAS

837
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,920
Oh my God!

838
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,560
It didn't do any good.

839
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,440
But you got him to notice you.
Now surprise him and grab his attention.

840
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,640
-Do something totally unexpected.
-Totally unexpected, huh?

841
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,480
Peekaboo!

842
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,520
Hello.

843
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,880
He's scared!

844
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,640
I failed. It's not working.

845
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,240
Jealousy.

846
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,600
Act like you're jealous.

847
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,720
Great. Smile.

848
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,680
Cemil.

849
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,080
Yes.

850
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Who's that?

851
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,920
Her? I don't know.

852
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,320
I don't want you seeing other women.
What's going on between you two?

853
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,800
Hey, look. What's with coming here
and posing and smiling at guys?

854
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,040
-What's wrong?
-Stop playing dumb.

855
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,880
You're making eyes at him.
You think I don't notice?

856
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,280
I know your type.

857
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,600
Sexy-talking man hunter.
Just what are you after?

858
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,480
What are you talking about? Get out.

859
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,520
Get out.

860
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,160
Aysel.

861
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,840
Your girl's going out
with that photographer, I hear.

862
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,200
They meet secretly at night.

863
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,840
Listen. He used to be a draper.

864
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,120
Then he went bankrupt.

865
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,680
No.

866
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,040
He had a kebab shop in Adana.
I heard his wraps were great.

867
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,040
He's going to keep Zeliha shut up in home.

868
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,840
And he'll hit it because
he wants three sons from her.

869
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Where did you get all this?

870
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,200
She just said she liked him, that's all.

871
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,920
She let everyone feel her up
when she was young.

872
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,400
Mom, what are you saying!

873
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,400
The vendor said
the wedding will be in Adapazarı.

874
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,840
Aysel said she was from Adapazarı
and insisted Zeliha get married there.

875
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,920
Ayten! I'm Aysel, aren't I?

876
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,040
Am I from Adapazarı?

877
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,080
That's what the vendor said.

878
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,400
Let's go ask the boy himself.

879
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,680
What is this?
Everyone's just spreading gossip.

880
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,400
I hate this sort of thing.
Get up. Get up and go.

881
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,280
Get up. Get up.

882
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,440
-Where are you from, my boy?
-Şirince.

883
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,160
-So your dad just got out of jail?
-Jail? No.

884
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,720
-You're single?
-Yes.

885
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,680
-How single are you?
-What?

886
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,680
-Are you seeing anyone?
-From the neighborhood?

887
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,720
Don't play with hearts.
Put a ring on it right away, OK?

888
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,000
-Get married first.
-We were young once.

889
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,440
I'm not saying don't do anything.
But be clear. Family is important.

890
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,080
-Of course it is.
-Come on, take our photo.

891
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,360
Get close to his family.

892
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,760
Get along with them.

893
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,240
-His family's not here.
-His brother is.

894
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,200
-Right. His brother.
-What was his name?

895
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,080
-How do I know?
-You don't know!

896
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,080
Spend time with him. Get him to like you.

897
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,360
The time will never pass with that loser.

898
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,280
Wow!

899
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,280
-This is Taksim Square, huh?
-Yeah.

900
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,320
I'm glad you asked me, Zeliha.
I wouldn't have had fun alone.

901
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,880
Look at the birds.

902
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,800
SUPER WHEEL

903
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,640
How do you come up with
the things you say?

904
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,720
Wait, you've got something in your hair.

905
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,920
-Zeliha, I had so much fun.
-I had fun too.

906
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,360
Wasn't it great
when those birds flew over us?

907
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,280
-I was scared they'd poop on us.
-You've picked up my accent.

908
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,080
-I live up there.
-OK then.

909
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,400
OK.

910
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,840
-Do you really like taking photos?
-I love it.

911
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,080
Especially when...

912
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,360
-There's a beautiful subject.
-Ha.

913
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,000
Zeliha!

914
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,280
My friends are here.

915
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,680
Thanks.

916
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,600
Say "hi" to Cemil for me.

917
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,120
Tell him what we did.

918
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,480
-He's your brother, he should know.
-Of course. Good night.

919
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,840
-What were you doing in there?
-Waiting for you. How was it?

920
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,280
-How was what?
-How was it with Cemil's brother?

921
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,840
What did you do?

922
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,480
We had fun.

923
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,440
-You're grinning ear to ear.
-Really.

924
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,360
No.

925
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,800
I had fun. He's the big brother after all.

926
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,600
-He was giving you such a look.
-He sure was.

927
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,160
He's my law-brother.

928
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,040
My in-law.

929
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,200
My brother-in-law, right?
What's it called?

930
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,880
What do they call the husband's brother?

931
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,000
Whoa!

932
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,600
Don't sneak up on me.

933
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,440
-Something silly happened.
-What?

934
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,280
You know Velev Bar in Beyoğlu?
The place with live music.

935
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,000
-How would we know?
-I used to go there. They have live music.

936
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,440
I'm singing there tomorrow night.
The owner said he'd try me.

937
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,360
That's great. Be happy.
It's what you always wanted.

938
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,880
-I don't find it right to be happy.
-Let's go. Why not?

939
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,440
Zeliha, ask Cemil and his brother.
This is your chance!

940
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,920
God help us all! Now scatter!

941
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,440
Let's scatter.

942
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,680
-How's it going?
-Good. Welcome.

943
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,560
He's singing at Velev Bar tonight.
Come support him.

944
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,920
-You don't really need to...
-Sure I will.

945
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,720
I'd love to support you. I'll bring Cemil.

946
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,520
-Be sure to come. We'll have fun.
-Oh, I'm sure we'll have fun!

947
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,320
What are you doing?

948
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,360
Working on Photoshop.
Cemil didn't want to do it.

949
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,920
Huh.

950
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,880
You should have the bride kneel
and stick the groom on her back.

951
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,800
I think it would be a lot cuter that way.

952
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,000
You know what? I'll do that.
We have incredibly similar taste.

953
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,200
OK, make-up. I need a very natural look.

954
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,760
Eye shadow.

955
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,120
I've never used it before.

956
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,160
Whoa.

957
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,360
Whoa. I wish I had.

958
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,120
Blusher. I reckon two strokes

959
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,440
will do it.

960
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,840
Whoa.

961
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,160
Whoa.

962
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,240
Whoa! I'm so beautiful.

963
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,200
I'm seriously good. Cemil...

964
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,600
Hello. I've never kissed anyone before.

965
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,000
But I'd kiss you.

966
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,200
Girl.

967
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,080
What are you doing?
Kissing the mirror?

968
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,360
No.

969
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,800
granny fancied this guy.

970
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,200
The guy tried to kiss her.
granny wouldn't let him.

971
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,240
The guy was miffed at her.
granny left him.

972
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,600
What?

973
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,440
granny wouldn't let him kiss her.

974
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,640
They broke up. granny's crying in there.

975
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,480
It's over between them.
granny thought it was too soon to kiss.

976
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,400
You go let him kiss you.

977
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,840
-What are you doing, Fatma?
-Zeliha.

978
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,440
They danced at my friend's wedding.

979
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,920
I was too heavy to dance it then.

980
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,120
It stayed with me.

981
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,840
But now that I'm slimmer,
I thought I'd get on down.

982
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,480
Come on, let's go.

983
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,280
Move!

984
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,240
Yes?

985
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,800
-We want to go in.
-Do you have a reservation?

986
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,080
-No.
-This is not your kind of place.

987
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,040
But we have to get in.

988
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,640
Come on, move along.
Stop giving me grief.

989
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,440
İdris?

990
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,600
-Look, it's İdris, isn't it?
-Who's İdris?

991
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,280
You're Sevcan's son, aren't you?

992
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,120
Ah, look at you!

993
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,680
You got all grown up
and now you wait at doors?

994
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,600
Good for you. Work. Earn a living.

995
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,200
Say a big "hello" to your mom.

996
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,840
Bye!

997
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,480
I'm not İdris.

998
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,120
It's a fun place here. Very friendly.

999
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,560
Nice one, Fato.
How do you know the guy?

1000
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,880
I don't. I just pretended.

1001
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,320
But there's an İdris I do know.
I can't stand his mom.

1002
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,480
She'd come to our tea parties,
stuff a napkin with goodies

1003
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,080
and leave.

1004
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,760
One time she nicked a towel.
And she says

1005
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,400
she only took it
because her boy had a stye.

1006
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,440
Imagine! With styes,
they say you should steal copper.

1007
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,160
She made it an excuse for the towel.
Rude cow.

1008
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,880
-I didn't hear a word.
-Zeliha, I'm telling you,

1009
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,680
this place scares me. Why are we here?

1010
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,360
For your friends, Havva.
For me. For Fevzi's future.

1011
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,240
What's up? You're cowering.

1012
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,040
What happened to the warrior woman?

1013
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,360
Tayyar slapped you, let me remind you.

1014
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,880
You reminded me and it's true.

1015
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,440
Fevzi.

1016
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,840
-Hi.
-Fevzi, can I have a beer?

1017
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,560
I'd kill for a cold one.

1018
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,440
Go for it, Fato. Let's hang loose today.

1019
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,760
-What can I get you?
-A beer.

1020
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,920
One beer.

1021
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,520
-Apple juice for me, bro.
-One apple juice.

1022
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,000
-And me, I'll get a small tea.
-One tea.

1023
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,360
Fevzi, you can go on stage now.

1024
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,200
One beer, one tea, one water, apple juice.

1025
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,040
Whiskey and coke, two beers, one raki.

1026
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,160
-Come on, get to it.
-Say it slowly, dammit!

1027
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,440
Whiskey and apple juice?
Who's drinking that?

1028
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,720
<i>Death is blowing in my face...</i>

1029
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,920
Whoa! The old boy likes me.

1030
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,360
<i>My death shroud is in tatters...</i>

1031
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,160
Whoa! That's sour apple juice.
Nice, though. I feel warm inside.

1032
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,680
<i>I scratched your name in my coffin...</i>

1033
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,880
-What the hell are we doing here?
-Come on, it's a friend's gig.

1034
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,120
Come on, die with me...
<i>-The crazy girl's here.</i>

1035
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,280
Don't be so rude. Hi there!

1036
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,280
Has he been on a long time?

1037
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,240
<i>Come on, die with me...</i>

1038
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,800
-You can see better from here, huh?
-Sure.

1039
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,000
Whoa!

1040
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,240
I felt your leg. It was warm as toast.
Is love hard work?

1041
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,680
Zeliha.

1042
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,200
I say you should sing.

1043
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,320
He'd be so impressed.

1044
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,480
You think so?

1045
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,600
<i>I scratched your name in my coffin...</i>

1046
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,320
-Let's swap places.
-You're the best brother.

1047
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,680
Fevzi, start the intro. "Always Later".

1048
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,920
I suddenly felt like singing a song

1049
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,520
for the person I love.

1050
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,160
He knows who he is.

1051
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:15,800
<i>You aren't Layla, I'm not Majnun</i>
<i>You aren't tired nor am I</i>

1052
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:23,440
<i>We felt blue one night</i>
<i>We got drunk that's all</i>

1053
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,000
<i>You aren't Layla, I'm not Majnun</i>

1054
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,240
Hey, I'm out of here.

1055
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:36,320
<i>You aren't tired nor am I</i>
<i>We felt blue one night, we got drunk</i>

1056
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,000
<i>That's all</i>

1057
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:47,560
I always come to my senses later
<i>Always later</i>

1058
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:54,720
<i>I always come to my senses later</i>
<i>Always later</i>

1059
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,480
Awesome, baby. You're terrific.

1060
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,880
<i>I always come to my senses later...</i>

1061
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,120
Is he bothering her?

1062
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,200
<i>Always later...</i>

1063
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,080
You're fantastic, baby!

1064
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,120
-Bravo, baby! Bravo!
-But you're harassing the lady.

1065
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,240
-Wait, you're harassing the lady.
-Whoa.

1066
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,560
-Screw you! This bitch is mine.
-Watch your mouth!

1067
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,480
Oh, my God, a fight.

1068
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,680
Oh, my God, a fight!

1069
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,920
-What are you doing? Break it up.
-Get off me! I'll kill you!

1070
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,520
Zeliha,
hold it to his eyebrow, not his mouth.

1071
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,520
I am, Havva.

1072
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,080
Shame they beat him up so bad.

1073
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600
You have a beautiful voice, Zeliha.

1074
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,040
Why did you get into a fight?

1075
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,520
-I was worried about you.
-I'm tough. I can fend for myself.

1076
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,720
No way. You don't have to
when you're with me. I'll protect you.

1077
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,560
Why?

1078
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,160
You're a nice guy, too, actually.

1079
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,400
You have a big heart.

1080
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,520
I could say you're a man
one could fall in love with.

1081
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,440
No man has ever loved me before, you know?

1082
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,200
But I think I'll be loved soon.

1083
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,880
I agree.

1084
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,600
-I like you a lot.
-Me too.

1085
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,440
Hey, soup man. Is your soup hot?

1086
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,360
Baby face is here.

1087
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,640
-Deliha and her stable mates.
-It's you who needs the stable.

1088
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,200
Hey, Havva.

1089
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,640
Suppose you forgive me
for the soup man's sake

1090
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,160
-so I get a good night's sleep?
-I don't.

1091
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,360
And even if she did, I don't.

1092
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,920
Here, watch this. Hey, Tayyar.

1093
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,920
Make an ugly face.

1094
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,360
Hey, don't! I told you. Don't do that.

1095
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,360
What do you smell of?

1096
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,120
Zeliha. You're now eating garlic
rather than soup.

1097
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,480
Oh, my God!

1098
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,840
Whoa!

1099
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,520
But you know what?

1100
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,320
It had a certain tang to it.

1101
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,840
It wasn't that bad.

1102
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,280
Oh, my God.

1103
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,240
I feel like something's happening to me.

1104
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,640
What do you feel like?

1105
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,640
Havva, I have the five of cups.
What do you have?

1106
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,160
Then let this song be for all of us.

1107
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,360
What was your name?
Your name...

1108
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,560
Her blood pressure's down.

1109
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,040
Get up! What's with the sleeping in?

1110
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,600
-What's up?
-Faik. He sent an arrears notice.

1111
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,000
He wants to kick us out. Let him try.

1112
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,840
Wait. Don't go alone.
I'm coming too. He'll kidnap you.

1113
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,080
What's that smell?

1114
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,280
Garlic.

1115
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,680
-Look, Faik!
-Go ahead, petal.

1116
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,040
Are you seriously evicting us?

1117
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,520
Let's not discuss it
with this crazy here, huh?

1118
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,200
-We pay rent.
-You don't give me what I want, petal.

1119
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,200
-You've no right to evict us.
-It's my house, you know?

1120
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,560
But don't worry.
I'm going to kick out Efshopshia first.

1121
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,760
Then it'll be your turn. Relax.

1122
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,600
Aysel.

1123
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,840
Have I ever told you
about my widow fantasy?

1124
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,360
Rude idiot!

1125
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,640
Hey! Listen here.

1126
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,200
You know my real estate agent fantasy?

1127
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,160
OK, I'll tell you.

1128
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:38,200
You're kidnapped by three guys
built like stallions.

1129
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,200
They find a big tree up on a hill.

1130
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,280
They tie you up face down.

1131
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,200
You look up at them with pleading eyes,

1132
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,880
but there's no mercy with them.
They pull down your pants.

1133
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,440
-Out of here, girl!
-Then as you're wailing...

1134
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,760
-I'll do it with demos next time.
-Come on, move!

1135
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,280
-Pumper!
-OK, go!

1136
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,000
Yes. Be here by tomorrow, mom.
We're asking for the girl's hand.

1137
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,280
What?

1138
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,080
I'm in love, mom.
I'm going to get married.

1139
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,760
Yes, she's pretty.

1140
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,920
I don't know her shoe size, mom.
Just hurry here tomorrow, OK?

1141
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,080
Bye. Kisses.

1142
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,200
What's going on?

1143
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,000
Tomorrow night
we're asking for Zeliha's hand for me.

1144
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,360
-Who? That crazy girl?
-Don't say that.

1145
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,680
She's so sweet.
So feisty. I love her to bits.

1146
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,440
Are you sure?
She doesn't seem that keen on you.

1147
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,080
Not to you she doesn't.
How did she start her song last night?

1148
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,880
She looked at me and said:
"He knows who he is." I do.

1149
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,400
-OK, if you're sure.
-Sure I am. We'll be so happy.

1150
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,040
Leave it to me.
Let's just get tomorrow over with.

1151
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,080
-Let's hope for the best.
-Totally.

1152
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,560
You go home. And shut the door.

1153
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,920
Who do you think you are?

1154
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,640
Who are you to kick us out? Dickhead!

1155
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,560
Scumbag!

1156
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,560
It's one thing after another.

1157
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,440
-What's up, Zeliha?
-Faik's kicking us out.

1158
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,240
Cemil isn't interested in me.
I look like an idiot.

1159
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,880
Whoa! I guess I'll become a wino.
The game's over.

1160
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,200
Now that's what I like.

1161
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,040
Hi. How are you, Zeliha?

1162
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,000
-What happened to your face?
-I got in a fight yesterday.

1163
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,200
I remember nothing.

1164
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,680
Um, I was going to say

1165
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,520
we want to come by tomorrow night
in a good cause. As a family.

1166
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,000
Should we come?

1167
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,560
-Who to?
-You.

1168
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,080
-In a good cause?
-Yes.

1169
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,840
-As a family?
-I thought so, yes.

1170
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,120
-What time?
-Around eight, I'd say.

1171
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,400
Around eight o'clock. OK.

1172
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,680
Whoa. He sent a message
with his big brother.

1173
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,680
I hope...

1174
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,640
I hope this isn't what I think

1175
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,040
-and that Cemil's brother fancies her... 
-Shh, girl!

1176
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,040
How about a spin by the water?

1177
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,880
-Kasım, is the car working?
-That young fella fixed it.

1178
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,720
-Which young fella?
-At the photo studio.

1179
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,120
The nicest,
the most handsome man in the world.

1180
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,160
He's coming to ask for my hand
tomorrow night. Whoa.

1181
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,760
-How are you? Are you well?
-Fine. And you?

1182
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,319
Fine, thanks.

1183
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,319
-How are you?
-Fine, thanks. You?

1184
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,359
Yes, we're fine, thanks.

1185
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,880
-How are you, son?
-Fine, thanks. You?

1186
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,200
I'm fine. Fine.

1187
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,920
-And you, son?
-I'm fine, thanks very much. You?

1188
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,399
-Me too, I'm fine.
-Wonderful.

1189
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:45,760
-And you're well?
-Yes, thanks.

1190
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,640
-Very well. You?
-Everyone's fine.

1191
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,200
<i>Once the act of mating has finished</i>
<i>between a pair of rhino,</i>

1192
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,840
<i>the male sinks onto the ground.</i>

1193
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,200
<i>Copulation is rarely seen</i>
<i>at the present time</i>

1194
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:02,439
<i>and leaves both rhino exhausted.</i>

1195
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,880
granny always watches
documentaries like that.

1196
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,479
Huh?

1197
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,920
What's that, mom?

1198
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,800
Zeliha, why don't you make us coffee?

1199
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,600
Ah, sure.

1200
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,080
God, I'm so happy.

1201
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Havva, I'm so happy.

1202
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,040
You're the cutest.

1203
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,240
See? You'll finally
marry the man you want.

1204
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,479
Zeliha, I want to say something.

1205
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,600
-You think Cemil's brother...
-Havva, wait.

1206
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:45,880
If I can keep my hand in the flame
for five seconds, I'll marry Cemil.

1207
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,240
Not that it's in any doubt.

1208
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,560
One, two, three...

1209
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:53,760
Whoa.

1210
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,080
I couldn't do it.

1211
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,720
Why was that?

1212
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,480
Tayyar, go away!

1213
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,400
Tayyar, go away.

1214
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,080
Shut up! I'm not here for you.

1215
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,120
-Havva.
-Go away, Tayyar.

1216
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,280
-Havva, forgive me.
-Don't, Havva!

1217
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,120
If you do, I'll never forgive you.

1218
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,640
Hey, Fato. Fato.

1219
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,120
Do I put salt in Cemil's coffee or pepper?

1220
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,560
They asked for my hand three times.
I did salt all three.

1221
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,320
OK, I'll go for pepper then.

1222
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,560
-Has someone you know died lately?
-No.

1223
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,440
You have a dead person's energy.

1224
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,440
No, really?

1225
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:39,240
Well, we've come here in a big rush,
but our boy insisted.

1226
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,520
Let's hope for the best.

1227
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,880
Except, these things
shouldn't really be rushed.

1228
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,320
Well, the kids have taken
a shine to each other.

1229
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,680
-Our Zeliha is a great girl.
-You can tell.

1230
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,680
Screw you if you spill.

1231
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,800
Zeliha, what are you doing?

1232
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,040
Funny girl.

1233
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,640
Thanks, dear.

1234
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,320
Whoa!

1235
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,560
Thank you.

1236
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,680
Husband, I don't want this girl.

1237
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,680
She's insane. Let's get out of here, fast.

1238
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,760
Absolutely not. We've come all this way.

1239
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,520
The boy loves her.

1240
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,680
I love her.

1241
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,160
Well, now.

1242
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,080
Bless you, mom. Bless you.

1243
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,720
-The kids seem to love each other.
-We do.

1244
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,400
And we've come to do what falls to us.

1245
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,080
By the will of God
and word of the Prophet,

1246
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,600
we ask for your daughter, Zeliha's hand
for our Cemal.

1247
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,240
Huh? Cemal?

1248
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,880
Cemil. It's Cemil.

1249
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,400
-No, dear. Cemal.
-No, Cemil.

1250
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,440
Girl, the older one's Cemal.
Cemil's younger.

1251
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,240
No way. It's Cemil.

1252
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,040
I'm confused. Is Cemil's name Cemal?

1253
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,240
OK, but it's Cemil who's into me.

1254
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,200
-What?
-Don't be ridiculous.

1255
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,600
Just a second. I don't understand.

1256
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,600
Who do you want Zeliha to marry?

1257
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,640
Me.

1258
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,080
Zeliha?

1259
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,920
I can't help laughing.

1260
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,040
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

1261
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,240
Just a second.

1262
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,680
What would I want with you?
Are you mental?

1263
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,240
Get out.

1264
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,000
I've never seen anything like it!
What rude people.

1265
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,320
Her thing was Cemil.

1266
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,360
Didn't you say you two were in love?

1267
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:40,120
-I guess I got the wrong idea.
-Never mind. The girl's an idiot. Mental.

1268
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,400
Didn't I warn you?
And you fell for her like a sucker.

1269
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,560
What's it to you?

1270
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,600
I fell in love. I wanted her, not you.

1271
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,040
-Bro.
-Yes, bro.

1272
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,640
I'm your big brother.

1273
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,800
I love a girl and it's for you
to sound off about her, huh?

1274
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,520
You're too trusting,
you're too gullible to know.

1275
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,880
Enough, dammit!

1276
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,640
All my life I've loved only one girl.

1277
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,760
It didn't work out. What can I do?

1278
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,160
It's me who's suffering.

1279
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,800
Just leave me alone, it's all I ask.

1280
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,600
OK, bro. I'm sorry.

1281
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
Time for Zeliha to kill herself.

1282
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,560
Suppose you don't, honey?

1283
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,400
-Have I choked?
-No.

1284
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,120
Out the way!

1285
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,520
Zeliha!

1286
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,200
Honey.

1287
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,080
Zeliha! Zeliha, open the door!

1288
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,360
I'm going to kill...

1289
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,640
I'm going to kill myself.

1290
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,800
Is that right?
How can this be happening?

1291
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,720
Zeliha, stop scaring us!

1292
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,640
Go away! Get away from here!

1293
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,480
Leave me alone!

1294
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,120
I want to die alone.

1295
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,800
I want to die in peace.

1296
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,120
Whoa. I'm on the brink of death.

1297
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,560
Auntie Aysel, I swear
she'll kill herself this time.

1298
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,240
Don't call me "auntie"!
I'm the same age as you.

1299
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,000
OK, it's goodbye.

1300
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,240
Whoa! My blood pressure dropped.

1301
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,800
I was upside down, mom.

1302
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,560
Help! Save me!

1303
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,760
Whoa! I can't die.

1304
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,240
I'm hanging myself.

1305
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,640
There. I'm dying.

1306
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,560
Fevzi! Come fix this!

1307
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,040
Make way.

1308
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,480
-Am I dead?
-No.

1309
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,440
I'm going to throw myself out the window.

1310
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,480
-Out the way!
-Wait!

1311
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,800
Zeliha, don't!

1312
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,000
Is she dead?

1313
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,200
I don't think so.

1314
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,320
What are you staring at?

1315
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,240
Now look. Who made me better, huh?

1316
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,880
I wanted to die.

1317
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,280
I'm still going try to kill myself.

1318
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,280
I can't go on. I don't want to be alive.

1319
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,440
Hello, Makbule?

1320
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,920
-Have we come round, Zeliha?
-I don't know. Have we?

1321
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,840
-Huh? Doctor.
-Yes?

1322
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,480
If I pay you 50 lira,

1323
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,680
can you inject
nitric acid in that solution?

1324
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,480
In your drip?

1325
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,560
For a long life, right?

1326
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,760
Are you taking the piss?
I asked you a serious question.

1327
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,600
I'll break your hypocritical oath.
Dickhead!

1328
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,720
Zeliha. Faik is evicting Efpraxia.
He's sent in the bailiffs.

1329
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,600
There are three or four chairs there.
Are they listed?

1330
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,720
Sorry. We're taking
that chair too, Efshopshia.

1331
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,360
-But this is shameful, Faik.
-Mind your own business.

1332
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:14,200
Throwing an old lady out...
Just hold it, I'm saying something here.

1333
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,480
Isn't it beneath you
to throw out an old lady?

1334
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,280
Keep your nose out of things
that aren't your business.

1335
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,200
-Go take photos.
-Put that hand down!

1336
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,360
What's your problem?
Are you going beat me up?

1337
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,720
Ha! Deliha's here.

1338
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,480
Who are you kicking out, dickhead?

1339
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,160
Watch that mouth.

1340
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,160
I have a hangover. I ache all over.

1341
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,760
Don't make me beat you up.

1342
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,000
I sealed a great deal last night,
you know?

1343
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,280
She's got the keys of the Jeep!

1344
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,520
Deliha!

1345
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,600
Come here! Deliha!

1346
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,800
Shame on you!
Come on, give me the keys, Deliha.

1347
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,640
Deliha!

1348
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,840
Honey.

1349
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,800
Come and get it.

1350
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,120
Stop that. What do you want?

1351
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,840
-Are you renting the house or not?
-No, dammit! No!

1352
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,640
Pull his pants down, guys.

1353
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,200
Hey! Hey, stop! Stop! OK, OK.

1354
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,080
What's up, İffet? Scared, are you?

1355
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,120
Deliha, sweetheart.
Let's talk. Wind down the window.

1356
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,240
Samim!

1357
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,400
Whoa! Hey!

1358
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,560
-OK. I'll rent it.
-Now, so all the neighborhood hears.

1359
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,440
OK, I'll rent the house.

1360
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,080
-Louder.
-Efshopshia, the house is yours.

1361
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,440
Not Eshopshia, Efkoptia.

1362
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,640
Efkoptia, the house is yours.

1363
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,920
God! What a happy day!
Havva, do you forgive me?

1364
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,680
-No.
-She still says no.

1365
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,880
So you tried to kill yourself?

1366
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,440
I guess so. I don't want to be alive.

1367
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:06,760
You want to kill yourself, <i>Pedi Mou</i>?
And you're so young, dear.

1368
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,000
But everyone saw, <i>Pedi Mou.</i>

1369
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:13,640
Cemil was in love with me.
He was hitting on me, wagging his tail.

1370
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,240
And his older brother wanted you.

1371
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,680
Yes. Sly dog.

1372
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,360
Listen, dear.

1373
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,680
-You made a mistake somewhere.
-Where exactly was that?

1374
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,520
You may be blind
to someone who truly loves you.

1375
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,160
You may not notice.

1376
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:38,040
Maybe his brother
fell in love with you, though.

1377
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:43,120
No. No one loves me. No one ever has.

1378
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,520
Maybe you...

1379
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,040
picked the wrong man. What do you say?

1380
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,520
-I'm thinking.
-Well, think carefully.

1381
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,720
-What's up? Where are you going?
-Mind your own business.

1382
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,440
We're going home.
To Şirince, to a wedding.

1383
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,600
Really?

1384
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,360
-Goodbye then.
-Goodbye.

1385
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,480
And thanks for everything.

1386
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,920
No problem. Have a good trip.

1387
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,240
Thanks.

1388
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,440
What's up?

1389
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,320
They're going to a wedding in Şirince
and not coming back.

1390
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,520
Sevim, what's up?

1391
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,120
You know Cemal? He's getting married.

1392
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:32,000
They're going back to their hometown.

1393
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,440
He said he's never coming back.

1394
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,440
What's going on?

1395
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,280
Cemal's so upset he's going home
for a spur-of-the-moment wedding.

1396
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,400
Oh, my God!

1397
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,560
Havva.

1398
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,640
Hey, Havva.

1399
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,880
-Come on, forgive me.
-No.

1400
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,640
Tayyar, shut up! I'm thinking.

1401
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,200
Zeliha, look what the fella left you.

1402
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,560
-What fella?
-The one who fixed my car.

1403
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,720
-Cemil.
-No, not Cemil. Cemal.

1404
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,280
Cemal?

1405
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,080
Open it. See what he's given you.

1406
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,840
Yes. Now I'm curious too.

1407
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,520
This is how I always see you.
As the sweetest girl in the world.

1408
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,440
“Good luck. Cemal.”

1409
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,360
-See? He loves you.
-He does?

1410
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,440
He does, Zeliha. Don't you see? Look.

1411
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,040
But no man has ever loved me before.

1412
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,480
I don't know what it's like.
How can I tell?

1413
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,560
Who'd love you, for goodness sake?
Just look at you!

1414
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:41,920
Tayyar...

1415
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,400
You know why I get mad at you?

1416
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,720
Because you always make fun of me.
You keep saying, "Just look at you."

1417
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,560
Do you think I wanted to be like this?

1418
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:57,600
When I was small,
I had to wear your castoffs.

1419
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,200
I walked around looking like a boy.

1420
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,600
I'd ask for a dress,
mom would say we were broke.

1421
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,400
You keep laughing at me.

1422
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,640
Hey, Zeliha.

1423
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,480
Have you ever asked
if I have any problems?

1424
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,440
I don't have a dad. My dad's dead.

1425
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,560
I figured if I was like a boy
I could protect mom and granny.

1426
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,120
Zeliha, I'm sorry.
I never thought of it like that.

1427
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:26,280
Guys always called me “son”.
They called me "mate", or "buddy."

1428
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,040
They called you "tomboy" too.

1429
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,680
Dammit, I'm have such a big mouth.

1430
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,800
None of them loved me either.

1431
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,560
Whoa.

1432
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,320
Have I just lost the one and only man
who ever loved me?

1433
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,920
It's that damn fortune-teller's fault.
I turned to the wrong person.

1434
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,600
He said the name had C, M and L in it.

1435
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,320
Whoa.

1436
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,320
Cemal. C, M, L.

1437
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Cemal has C, M and L in it, too.
My Cemal!

1438
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:00,840
Zeliha!

1439
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,800
Junk man!

1440
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,360
Oh my God, it's locked.

1441
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,560
-They went to a wedding.
-A wedding?

1442
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:17,760
Cemal was so upset he's gone away
to have a spur-of-the-moment wedding.

1443
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,400
A spur-of-the-moment wedding?

1444
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,920
-Where?
-In his hometown, Şirince.

1445
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,560
-Whoa! So Cemal's getting married.
-Come on, Zeliha. We can make it.

1446
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,120
But how do we get there, Fatma?

1447
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,840
Come on, hop in.

1448
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,040
Kasım!

1449
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,000
Drive on.

1450
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,680
What's up?

1451
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,760
Zeliha's run off with Cemal.

1452
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:59,160
They slept together
so now they have to get married.

1453
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,920
What?

1454
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,480
Aysel, Zeliha's been deflowered.
She's gone off to get married.

1455
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,200
Let her go, mom. Just open the window.

1456
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,840
Open the window. It's so hot.

1457
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,480
It's so hot.

1458
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,400
It's so hot.

1459
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,880
Well, well, well! Look who's here!

1460
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,680
-Remember me?
-No.

1461
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,320
Aren't you Nesrin's son, Cemal?

1462
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,760
Yes, that's me.

1463
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,480
-You still don't remember?
-No, sorry.

1464
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,920
Well I'll be damned.
You used to come to me as a boy and say:

1465
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,800
"What nice boobs you have."
Then you grabbed a handful and go.

1466
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,480
-You still don't remember?
-No.

1467
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,520
-When are you getting married?
-I'm not.

1468
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,320
There'll be the prettiest girls
coming here tonight.

1469
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,560
-Take your pick and I'll fix it for you.
-OK.

1470
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,920
I tell you what.

1471
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,240
You'll be able to go to sleep
on a wifey's boobs

1472
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,360
and play with them
to your heart's content.

1473
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,120
They want photos taken
in the village, bro.

1474
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,720
I've been at it all day. You go.

1475
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,040
-I'm not the photographer. Do it yourself.
-It'll be a distraction.

1476
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,680
And a gesture
seeing as the groom's our cousin.

1477
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,120
OK. Give it here.

1478
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,880
If you'll excuse me...

1479
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,640
-But I only just found you!
-I have to take photos.

1480
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,280
Hey, come here. Sit down.

1481
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,160
Aren't you Nesrin's son, Cemil?

1482
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,680
-Yes.
-Remember me?

1483
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,880
-No.
-Come on, I'm Hatçe, aren't I?

1484
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,240
You'd come and squeeze my boobs as a boy.

1485
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,840
-Still don't remember?
-No.

1486
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,360
Shame on you!

1487
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,160
How much further, Kasım?

1488
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,240
Whoa. Fuck!

1489
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,000
I'm telling you, Zeliha.
Swearing is sinful.

1490
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,800
What's going on? Havva?

1491
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,200
I'm stepping on it, Zeliha.

1492
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,200
They came to ask for my hand
three years ago.

1493
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,320
Remember Feryal's nephew?

1494
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,800
He was wearing a tie.
The ends were all dirty.

1495
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,320
I felt sick when I saw him.
I thought, oh, my God!

1496
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,280
-Havva, forgive me.
-No.

1497
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,440
Whoa! If she does, I don't.

1498
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:09,320
If Cemal marries before I arrive,
I swear I'll kill myself. Whoa!

1499
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,240
Something's gotten into all of you.

1500
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,760
In the name of God...

1501
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,800
Something's happening to me.

1502
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,920
Oof! Thank God!

1503
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,440
Dear Kasım.

1504
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,040
Something got into you all in my dream.

1505
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,000
I swear you were dressed as a woman.

1506
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:34,000
Hey, I'm talking to you!
Wake up! What's with the sleeping?

1507
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,000
What's going on?

1508
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,520
Kasım.

1509
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,240
We've blown a tire.

1510
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,760
Man! Damn tire!

1511
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,040
You...

1512
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,240
Out the way!

1513
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,440
Whoa!

1514
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,080
Well, it was old.

1515
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,520
-There's no spare either.
-What do you mean?

1516
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,840
But the wedding... We can't be late.

1517
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,880
Whoa! I'm finished!

1518
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,240
I'm going to die unloved!

1519
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,240
OK, girl! Just calm down!
I'll handle it. Wait.

1520
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,840
Zeliha.

1521
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,600
Our Dürdane got a car, you know.
A 2002 model.

1522
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,560
And boy, did they show off.

1523
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,000
They'd planned a trip back home.
And guess what? The car broke down.

1524
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,280
-Fatma.
-Yes, petal?

1525
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,880
Shut up!

1526
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,080
Over here, come on!

1527
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,920
-Bravo, Tayyar. Go!
-Good! We'll have lots of room.

1528
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,200
Kasım...

1529
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,400
-You'll be OK, won't you?
-Sure, dear.

1530
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,600
Goodbye.

1531
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,040
I'll call my child Kasım, Kasımcan.

1532
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,280
Come on!

1533
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,160
Kasım.

1534
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

1535
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,880
-Welcome.
-Hi, guys.

1536
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,200
<i>Göz Göz Göztepe! Göz Göz Göztepe!</i>

1537
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,160
Come on, smile.
It's the happiest day of your lives.

1538
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,440
Yes.

1539
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,360
Very good. Time to move on
to the concept shots, OK?

1540
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,880
-Sure, let's do it.
-Good grief, bride. Aren't you keen!

1541
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,080
OK, grab Nusret's tie and pull.

1542
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,360
That's the best yet.
We've got our concept.

1543
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:31,720
OK, squat, bride.
The entire household is on your shoulders.

1544
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,040
Climb on top, Nusret.

1545
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,160
Perfect. Now swap places.

1546
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,240
Climb on top, bride.

1547
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,160
Groom's sister, you're fuming.
Throttle the bride.

1548
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,760
Aunt, they're taking your son.
Grab his arm. Don't let go.

1549
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,120
-Is this what they do in Istanbul?
-Sure. It's all the rage.

1550
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,680
Uncle, you, head the family,
spread your arms; show your authority.

1551
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,160
-İbrahim, you were out of it.
-Oh, no!

1552
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,840
You got it! Bravo.
It's like you don't want to see.

1553
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,280
Perfect. How about we do a tower?

1554
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,800
Sure, let's do it.

1555
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:11,080
Now, the bride's fleeing
and you're all chasing her.

1556
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,520
Don't move. Stay put. Just move your arms.

1557
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:19,320
Bravo, groom's sister.
Keep up the grimace.

1558
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,920
Masterful.
Now a new concept: the bride's dead.

1559
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,240
Nusret's in pieces, the family distraught.

1560
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,240
Let's do it. Die, gorgeous.

1561
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,320
Nusret, you go to pieces.

1562
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,280
Hanife, what's with the long face?

1563
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,080
You're the groom's sister.
You should be happy.

1564
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,600
Come on then.

1565
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:41,320
Aunt, let's see
those crocodile tears. Yes.

1566
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,280
Ibrahim, forget me,
but at least have some for the corpse.

1567
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,800
OK, please. Take in position.

1568
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,560
-Oh, no.
-Ha, bravo!

1569
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,000
Incredible.

1570
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:57,080
At 19, I was in love with a tall,
handsome boy called Kadir.

1571
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:01,880
For five years I turned down anyone
who asked for my hand.

1572
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,320
Then they said I was over the hill.

1573
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,080
So boys, Kadir wrecked my youth,
my whole life.

1574
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,400
You killed my youth, Göztepe!

1575
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,880
You killed my youth, Kadir!

1576
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
-Shame on you!
-Shame on you, Kadir!

1577
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:21,480
In that case,
for Fatma, for love...

1578
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:30,760
<i>Moses moseys to the shrine</i>
<i>I have to grab a swig of wine</i>

1579
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,320
<i>I feel blue, blue, blue</i>

1580
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,560
<i>One, two, three</i>

1581
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,480
<i>Göztepe</i>

1582
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,760
<i>Göztepe</i>

1583
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:48,720
<i>La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la, Göztepe...</i>

1584
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,240
Sit down! Police!

1585
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,800
Out of the bus.
We're doing a search, friends.

1586
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,640
But officer, no one's given us
anything to carry.

1587
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,600
That's for me to decide.

1588
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,640
-Who are you?
-Hooligans.

1589
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:08,360
-Come on.
-Fight all to the end, Göztepe!

1590
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:12,280
Drop it for God's sake.
Get out of the bus. Move.

1591
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,800
Get out, guys. Come on.

1592
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,600
Where are they going?

1593
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,160
-OK, fine. But what's this peashooter?
-It isn't ours, officer.

1594
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,680
-Whose is it?
-No idea.

1595
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,640
The women hooligans.

1596
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,640
Start the car!

1597
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,120
Whoa. They're coming.

1598
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,440
I'll rot in jail
before I hook up with my love.

1599
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,520
I'm like an unopened parcel.
I'm like a rosebud.

1600
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,880
It's a heavy load. We can't go faster.

1601
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,080
-Let's dump the watermelons.
-Yes!

1602
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,200
Watch it! Watermelons!

1603
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,440
No!

1604
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,360
It's such a waste!
Don't! That's food!

1605
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,760
True.

1606
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,440
-I'm slowing you down.
-Don't be crazy, Fatma.

1607
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,760
Forgive me!

1608
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,200
Oh, my God, she fell off.

1609
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,440
Thanks, Fato!

1610
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,480
I'll never forget that favor.

1611
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,040
She'll be fine. Don't worry.
She'll find a way. Keep going.

1612
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,280
What do you think you're doing?

1613
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,360
-İdris?
-Yes.

1614
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,920
-Aren't you Sevcan's son?
-Yes.

1615
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,120
Sevcan was in our tea party group.

1616
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:16,600
Bravo, you're a policeman.
So have you come to rescue me?

1617
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,760
Come here! Ah! Come on!

1618
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,880
İsmail, buddy, come over
and let's rescue her.

1619
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,680
You guys get off here.

1620
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,800
I'll go back to dump this
and check up on Fatma. I'll be back.

1621
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,600
-How?
-What do you mean?

1622
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:40,320
We won't make it on this anyway.
You go to the wedding. I'll find you.

1623
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,000
Havva! Forgive...

1624
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,680
Never mind.

1625
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,760
It's OK. Bye.

1626
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,640
OK. What do we do? How do we get there?

1627
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,720
We spent all the money on petrol.

1628
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,080
We'll ask a car for a ride.

1629
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,040
You can't ask like that!

1630
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,680
In movies you get sexy women
showing their legs to hitch a ride.

1631
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,480
Havva.

1632
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,880
-Hi. We're going to Şirince.
-OK. Jump in.

1633
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:21,720
I'm soiled.

1634
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,760
I'll never forget this favor, Havva.
Come on, climb in.

1635
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,600
Please God, don't let him be married.

1636
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,640
-<i>As your wife?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1637
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:04,000
<i>With the authority vested in me</i>
<i>by the Mayor of Selçuk,</i>

1638
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,760
<i>I pronounce you husband and wife.</i>
<i>You may kiss the bride.</i>

1639
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,080
Don't kiss her! Stop!

1640
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,320
-Who's that girl?
-I don't know, sweetie.

1641
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,400
Whoa! Who are you? Where's Cemal?

1642
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,000
Who's Cemal, Nusret?

1643
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,240
My cousin. He took the pictures, right?

1644
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,280
Look, he's there.

1645
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:22,880
OK, you can kiss her.

1646
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,520
Cemal...

1647
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,440
Welcome.

1648
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,560
Why did you come?

1649
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,200
I brought you this.

1650
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,240
But I made it for you.

1651
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:46,480
Cemal, I didn't realize you loved me.

1652
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,840
-I couldn't see it.
-People see what they want to see.

1653
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,240
But the fortune-teller told me.

1654
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,600
Otherwise I had a great time with you.

1655
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,760
Chasing the birds
at the amusement park.

1656
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,360
Havva even said I was staring at you
in the soup place.

1657
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,400
-Zeliha, do you love me?
-Huh?

1658
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,920
-Do you love me?
-Huh?

1659
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,280
I said: "Do you love me?"

1660
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,480
-Cemal...
-Huh?

1661
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,560
I love you.

1662
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:18,800
What?

1663
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,800
I love you. I love you.

1664
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,720
-I love you too, crazy girl.
-Don't call me crazy.

1665
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,000
-Shall we dance?
-Let's do it.

1666
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:43,440
Look who the boy picks
when there are all these pretty girls!

1667
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,360
Hey, come on, mom. OK.

1668
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:50,720
-Did we make it?
-Yes, we did.

1669
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,320
Fatma, are you OK?

1670
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,480
Fine. It couldn't be better.

1671
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,120
Fevzi, where are you going?

1672
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:03,040
Excuse me a moment.
Are you the bride's side or the groom's?

1673
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:06,360
-The groom's. You?
-I fixed the bride with her gold.

1674
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,440
I'm a jeweler. They invited me, so I came.

1675
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,920
I'm glad I did.

1676
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,520
Shall we dance?

1677
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,160
Dear God, you're a great God.

1678
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,400
Come on then.

1679
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,360
Thank goodness you're here.

1680
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,480
Why? Were you worried?

1681
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,040
Sure I was.

1682
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,920
In that case forgive me, Havva.

1683
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,280
Why is it such a big deal for you?

1684
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:36,880
Look. My granny never got to forgive me
before she died, Havva.

1685
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,120
She was sick. I asked her to forgive me
for everything I'd done to hurt her.

1686
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,480
She died before answering.
I've had a lump here ever since.

1687
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,000
Whenever someone forgives me,
I forget that lump for a minute.

1688
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,000
I can't help it.

1689
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,320
-OK.
-Come on, Havva. Forgive me.

1690
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,120
OK, Tayyar.

1691
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:57,760
-Don't say that. Come on.
-Tayyar, I said OK. I do.

1692
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,760
Do you really?

1693
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,720
My God.

1694
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,240
-Zeliha...
-Huh?

1695
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,880
I didn't get to propose before.

1696
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,720
What?

1697
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,320
Will you marry me?

1698
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,200
When?

1699
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,520
Whenever you'd like.

1700
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,440
Whoa.

1701
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,520
For the bride and groom,

1702
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,760
and all those who love each other.

1703
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,280
I just want to sing
my aunt's favorite song.

1704
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:13,920
{\an8}<i>I set fire to the hay</i>
<i>See the smoke blow away</i>

1705
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:22,280
{\an8}<i>Your mean mother</i>
<i>I convinced her</i>

1706
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:28,560
{\an8}<i>Shake it, shake it, come on, shake it</i>
<i>Ah, let's see you coyly shake it</i>

1707
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:35,840
{\an8}<i>Shake it, shake it, come on, shake it</i>
<i>Shake it, hazel-eyed dearly beloved</i>

1708
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:37,880
{\an8}<i>I'm pouring a cup of tea</i>
<i>Greet your father for me</i>

1709
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:46,640
{\an8}<i>If he won't let me wed his girl</i>
<i>He'll see tragedy unfurl</i>

1710
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:52,720
{\an8}<i>Shake it, shake it, come on, shake it</i>
<i>Ah, let's see you coyly shake it</i>

1711
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:59,560
{\an8}<i>Shake it, shake it, come on, shake it</i>
<i>Ah, let's see you coyly shake it</i>
