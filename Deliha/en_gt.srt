You're starting to be very rude.

I don't like unrest in my neighborhood.

55
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,160
You burned the boy's suits. You burned your future, you burned the child.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,080
What would I do, Eve, huh?

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
They were locked.

58
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,200
Would they slip on each other if I let them, huh?

59
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,080
It wasn't boiling anyway.

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,960
Somewhere between boiling and warm.

61

Already my aunt is my son. I'm getting annoyed. What to you, huh?

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,520

Definitely 40 degrees.

Look at me, we don't have men on our heads.

83
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,840
Going out with a woman like that, oh my.

-I'll throw the slippers on your head, huh. -I swear I'll hang you from the ceiling by your ears.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,840
Shut up girl, that's my word.

86
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,520
You burned the cover again.

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,400
The cover is lousy, the cover is.

88

Maybe your luck will come out, what do you know? Ha?

96
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,080
Do not be afraid girl, I will not put you in the ground without a shroud. I will give it back.

Come on, say goodbye.

Ay, I don't like this type of person, I don't like his mother at all.

117
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
His mother kicked his mother-in-law out of the house. The woman is on the street.

118
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,480
Thank God his brother came and took it, but that's it.

119
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,960

Thank you.

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,680
It will run soon. I will execute.

136
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,040
Let's hope.

Girl Zeliha, "Good luck." isn't he?

139
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,640
There are those who say about health, and there are those who say about hours. Honestly clocks, know them.

140
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,320
-So you're going to open a photographer, huh? -[Ege şivesike] We'll see, good luck.

141
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,920
Yes, I think we will open the last photographer in this period.

-Are you number one? -Astagfurullah.

144
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,560
One day it came; "Brother." he said, "I'm going to read photography." said. Look.

145
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,920
"My son, don't go, don't go. A photograph is not something to be read,

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,240
Even though we said it was something that was photographed, he didn't listen, he went and read it.

147
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,040
When we graduate, we said, let's open a shop at least so that he can get his bread.

148
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,640
Well, I didn't want a shop.

149
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,520
Also, is the shop thing left? Everyone's hands are ringing with a phone.

150
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,680
Don't put water in, delibas, we talked about these.

151
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,720
It's more warm my son to take the photo, it's more beautiful.

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,440
-I feel cold when I look at the screen. -Touching is another thing.

153
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,680
So, so.

154
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,560
-Take a picture of me and let me see. -How is it, brother?

155
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,200
How is it, son? You're going to center it and press it.

156

Tell me about my current love life.

167

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,120
No, your sign is Pisces. Your Ascendant is Leo, your Moon sign is Scorpio.

175
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,680
[shouts] I'm not a Pisces.

176
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,440
Pisces is emotional, what's emotional about me? Ha? Stupid.

177
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,280
This is retarded.

178
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,400
I can tell you live with your mother and grandmother.

179
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
Dad died, he was a truck driver.

180
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
You grew up like a man. Your mother is in menopause. Let's go to grandma's head.

181
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,160
And there is no one in your life.

182
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,600
It has never been. You've always been platonic.

183
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,160
You loved, no one else loved you.

184
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,520
-You've always been such a loser. -[surprised] Girl.

185
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,600
He knows this. Look, I'm stuck like this huh.

186
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,480
-A bit like you know. -You're a loser, he told you.

187
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,920
-By Allah, he knows. -Lan, Fatma sister.

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,640
I swear I'll blow your nose, huh. It's in everyone over there. Shush.

189
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,520
You are at home.

190
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,920
fortune teller

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,120
Even if we don't say we stayed at home, let's say we are selective.

192
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
No, your cousins ​​are talking behind your back.

193
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,040
Durdane, right? My aunt's daughter, my cousin.

194
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,160
He has Hashimoto, he can't lose weight.

195
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,760
Shut up. What about us?

196
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,000
You will look at me, my fortune. Haci, you will look at me horoscope.

197
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,200
In a previous life you were a Bedouin in Egypt.

198
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,480
What girl is she?

199
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,080
I can tell you like a boy in the neighborhood too.

200
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,800
Short, baby-faced.

201
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,840
In your previous life

202
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,200
You were one of the warrior amazon women.

203
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,600
You are not very keen on fortune-telling.

204
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,360
Sorry, his information just came. Sorry.

205
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
Its.

206
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,120
You make such weird songs. In your previous life

207
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,280
-You threw it. -I'm not interested in horses.

208
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,720
Are you doing it on purpose, huh?

209
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Are you making a fuss? I came to give you fortune-telling.

210
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,320
You will look at me. You will look at me, not at them.

211
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Well, it's not clear what you were before.

212
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
What's wrong with me! What am I anyway?

213
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,920
Are we asking him?

214
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,480
Will I fall in love? Ha? Is anyone going to fall in love with me?

215
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,440
How should I know, destiny is destiny.

216
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,640
damn whistle.

217
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
Then why did I come here? Ha?

218
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,000
[bangs his hand on the table]

219
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,360
You threw it, you were a butterfly, what the hell?

220
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,240
Tell me who I'm going to fall in love with.

221
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,760
I swear I'll stick my fingers in your eyes, huh.

222
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,440
- Someone who will be very soon. -Who?

223
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,880
A brand new one. You fall in love, and then marriage appears.

224
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,040
Kim? Kim?

225
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
It has the letters C, M, L inside.

226
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,240
C, M, L.

227
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,120
-Like Selim? -C, M, L.

228
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,080
-David? -I say C, M, L.

229
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,720
When I'm in love -By God, this job will be done in ten, fifteen days.

230
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,320
[slap sound] Ah.

231
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,560
-There was a fly. -I know, the information has arrived.

232
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,760
Whoa.

233
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,280
Guys, this is the shop.

234
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,560
Clean up now and start shooting.

235
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,480
Brother, is there a dark room or something?

236
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
No never.

237
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Everywhere gets light. Brilliant, spacious.

238
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
[in a low voice] What am I saying, what is this saying?

239
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,880
Now, the handsome one is Cemil.

240
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,400
Jamal, who is clueless. You're that older brother, aren't you?

241
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,040
[in Aegean dialect] Yes. I'm my brother too, it would be nice if you didn't call me uncool.

242
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,520
Why do you speak with such a dialect and he speaks normally?

243
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,280
My Cemil studied high school and university here. He became urban.

244
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,320
-We stayed in Şirince. -Is it Sirince? I've never heard of it.

245
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,960
How did you not hear? They said that the end of the world will break, but everyone gathered.

246
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
-So? Doomsday did not break. -It could have broken, though.

247
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,240
That's where we grow grapes.

248
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,040
Grape? How grape? Black or white?

249
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,840
Green. But nah like that, big.

250
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,360
off. Either the big one is different, the round one is different.

251
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,720
Especially when it's upright like a drop.

252
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,200
Actually, we have a peach, split peach. Aqueous.

253
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,600
Oh man, stop, don't add fuel to the fire, what are you doing?

254
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,400
Of of of.

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
-Juicy juicy, isn't it a peach? -Of course.

256
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,320
It's like honey.

257
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,800
There are furry lovers, there are hairless lovers.

258
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,280
Although I like both.

259
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,280
-The man adores fruit. -Yeah, of course.

260
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,840
Guys, you guys, come inside and have a look.

261
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,640
[in a low voice] It's okay, it's okay here. OK, this is it now.

262
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,880
Look, you throw a mattress over there, just in case.

263
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,080
No, I don't look for sleep or something like that.

264
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,120
What about sleeping at this age?

265
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,240
To make love.

266
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,680
-Brother, we have no such intention. -Oh, intention is important.

267
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,360
For example, I am always intentional. -Pardon?

268
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
I'm saying that the white of the woman will be different. Like grapes.

269
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,680
Brother, is that all here? So where is the kitchen?

270
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,080
There is no kitchen. But there is a counter in the kitchen at my house.

271
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,240
Aha, as much as this shop.

272
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,600
Gee. What are you doing at the counter so much?

273
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
I shoot meat.

274
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,080
-Is it unbreakable? -Unbreakable. Even if it breaks, I'll take your heart.

275
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,960
Brother, let's think about it, let's take a look.

276
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,240
I say don't decide before you see the toilet.

277
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,480
Look, I'm showing.

278
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's not decide without seeing the toilet. Let's see the toilet.

279
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
Look.

280
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,080
Wow, look.

281
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,680
Isn't it very cool? Look.

282
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,040
You go in here, you go out of here. You are sitting here.

283
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,240
You act like a king like this.

284
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,560
We got it!

285
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
We got it, we got it. We've been holding on.

286
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,480
Who is C, M, L? Even if it's Hasan, it doesn't have C in it.

287
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,800
-[low voice] It is forbidden to have fortune telling. -Are you out of money?

288
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,080
Haram, haram.

289
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,440
I liken fortune-telling to funerals. You lean your back on the coffin.

290
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,560
Shut up, shut up. You vomit inside us.

291
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,800
Why are we making friends with him? -[whispers] He doesn't have any other friends.

292
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,520
Mom, I'm sad now.

293
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,880
-Zeliha! -Ha?

294
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,160
Girl!

295
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,800
-Look, look, look. -What? What?

296
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,280
OK. Well, it would be better if it was black.

297
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,720
Girl, I'm not saying that, look at the plate.

298
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,440
34 CML. Ana is the love of my life.

299
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,440
[ambulance passes]

300
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Oh, I'm going to fall in love now.

301
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,960
[clicks glass]

302
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,600
[window opens]

303
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,800
Ana!

304
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,440
Uncle is out.

305
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,320
- What's your name, uncle? -Sıtkı.

306
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,960
-Shitki? -Yup.

307
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,480
Come on, walk away.

308
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,320
go go. He also eats the hamburger. Let's.

309
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,720
[window closes]

310
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,720
Tue. Filthy.

311
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,680
-Come on, good luck Cemil Efe. - All right, brother Cemil, this is the job.

312
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,960
I swear, for my brother's sake, brother.

313
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,360
Otherwise, I will not open a shop that will go bankrupt in two days.

314
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,560
-By God, you know, brother. -[emotional music begins]

315
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,160
My moms said, "Open him a shop." said.

316
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,840
"At least he'll have a place to lay his head." said.

317
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,160
-[music cuts] -But if you say

318
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,880
I won't open it, let's go to Şirince.

319
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,040
Uff. OK, whatever.

320
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,040
At least that owner hadn't asked for three months' rent upfront. What was it?

321
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,160
What to do man? He needs cash.

322
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,880
-Let go bro, all of these are dishonest. -I own it, you know?

323
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Born?

324
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,080
The man was kidding us. [laughs]

325
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,360
-Why are you telling me now? -I can't get a commission if I tell you first, baby.

326
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,920
There is no brother. If we give commission or something, we do not keep the shop.

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,600
Look, you signed, signature. There is a contract.

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,360
[Faik] How relieved.

329
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,600
-It's been empty for two and a half years, huh. - Hop hop hop.

330
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,080
You know, they emptied the shop last week? That's what you were telling me.

331
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,080
Who said that? Did I say?

332
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,960
Wow.

333
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,160
Let's do this bro.

334
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,280
Let's go to bed, brother, over there, you slip on us and relax. What do you say?

335
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,920
-What? -Nothing. No.

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,720
[laughs] Nothing, his brother is joking.

337
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,600
Let's go and do our business at the bank.

338
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,480
What are you talking about son? Rudeness.

339
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,600
Brother, just come over for a minute.

340
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,480
Let's stop by somewhere, then we'll go.

341
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,599
[hits my glass]

342

Efşopşiya Hanım, Efşopşiya Hanım.

343
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,160
[Speaks with a Greek accent] Efpraksia. This is my name.

344
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,079
Okay, what did I say? Didn't I say Efchoopsia?

345
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,319
-What happened to our money? The rent is only a week late.

346
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,319
Look, the next time the rent's late, he has to get you out of the house.

347
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,040
[Greek makes an offer] I will stay. baby.

348
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,319
[speaks Greek]

349
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,800
What are you talking about? Where will I go?

350
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,200
For example, I can have this place demolished and a residence built instead.

351
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,840
-What? -Residence.

352
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,360
-Sounds good, huh. -[bumping sound]

353
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,320
Ah! Delilah!

354
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,440
Not Deliha, my name is Zeliha.

355
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,240
Is this trying to get you out of the house too, Aunt Efkoptiya?

356
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,160
My daughter says I will get you out of the house.

357
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,080
[Speaks with a Greek accent] What do you mean you're going out?

358
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,960
Who are you kicking out of the house bro?

359
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,560
This woman has always been here. No one can take it out.

360
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,200
Why are you talking like that?

361
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,760
To get this woman out of this house, you have to break my death.

362
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,560
Got it, got it?

363
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,760
I'm half the town. Even your house is mine.

364
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,320
If I want I can remove it immediately, but in order.

365
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,920
You make shit.

366
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,040
You will come out. Stupid.

367
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,160
Lan!

368
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,720
[shouts]

369
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,320
[shouting] I couldn't bite!

370
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,600
Don't take it out on the street without a collar. It bites children.

371
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,400
- Let it go, I couldn't quite bite it. Let go! -Shoo!

372
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,600
[screams] You got it.

373
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,280
I hope they take you to the mountain and have it.

374
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,520
I hope you will thank you who came before you.

375
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,520
-Who is this girl, Mr. Faik? -He's the neighborhood idiot.

376
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
I like his mother alone.

377
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,160
She's a very genuine girl, it's hard to find such a thing nowadays.

378
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,560
-What? -I hope you squat towards the horse.

379
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,080
I say bank, before closing.

380
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,800
What do you mean squat? Ha?

381
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
I read the wrong curse. Let it go.

382
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,000
[car starts]

383
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,480
İt. İt!

384
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,800
Filthy! Leave.

385
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,920
Zeliha. Look, it's gone.

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,720
Calm down. Gone. sit down, sit down.

387
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,080
Look, calm down.

388
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,320
Hop! What's going on?

389
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,760
-Don't get involved, bebeto. -[Mumbling] Faik Zelihaları...

390
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
Are you going to work from home for an exorbitant price?

391
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,280
Whoa! You don't look like that type at all, huh.

392
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
Faik was going to drive Zeliha out of the house.

393
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,080
-Ha. So take it out. - By the way, I'm going to hit your head with this fist.

394
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,280
Thanks to you. Why did you burn me?

395
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,720
It's still burning here and there.

396
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I wish I was cousin with dog instead of you. Disguised as a wife.

397
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,640
Be a little lad and protect your aunt's daughter.

398
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,280
Look at me, speak straight.

399
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,640
Tayyar, be ugly!

400
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,640
[Laughs]

401
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm telling you, don't do this, my daughter.

402
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,520
I didn't get my ambition. I'm going to loot this realtor.

403
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,480
Hoot! What's going on?

404
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,760
Whoa!

405
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,120
Whoa.

406
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,160
Who are you? Are you working here?

407
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,480
No, we took over the shop from Mr. Faik.

408
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,800
Which shop?

409
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,560
Well, right here in the square, Foto Neco.

410
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
-Photo Neco. -Yeah.

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,040
Haa.

412
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,200
Hadji, I had a animosity.

413
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,040
I came to loot the shop. you know

414
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,240
I was going to throw my head left and right. Maybe table-breaking attempts with elbow strength.

415
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,680
Maybe a little flying kick, I don't know.

416
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,360
But you just arrived.

417
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,400
And oh...

418
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,960
... you are very handsome.

419
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,480
Now it would be a shame for you, if I come and wash it again.

420
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,080
Understood.

421
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,800
-What is your name? -Camil.

422
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,760
It's okay, Cemil, see you soon.

423
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,960
[something comes to mind]

424
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,040
-What did you say my name was? -Camil.

425

429
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,560
-I am very pleased with you. -I do not understand?

430
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,080
Shall we go dancing tomorrow afternoon, you, me, the three of us?

431
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,720
-What rope? - Uncle Kadri has a wedding.

432
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,840
Who is your Uncle Kadri? I can't reach you.

433
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,600
Don't you like to dance, huh? I think it's great to be the head of halay.

434
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
What?

435
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,520
I will go. I have a vest on the stove, don't let it overflow.

436
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,160
It's done, we've seen it.

437
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
[romantic music begins]

438
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,240
Allah Allah.

439
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,360
[Eve] Zeliha?

440
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,800
What's going on?

441
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
[music cuts]

442
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,880
-Assalam Alaikum, brother. -Aleykum Selam.

443
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,440
-Where did Faik Abi go? -Faik Abi, very short went to the bank.

444
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,120
-Who is short? Did you say it to me? I say it won't take long.

445
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,080
Oh, you're tall, I'm short. Are you saying that, are you saying that bro?

446
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,200
Come on! My brother Faik Abi will go this far. The event is stunted.

447
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,920
Oh, that's it. You didn't give up, bro.

448
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
The event is stunted huh?

449
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,240
[shouting] Camels are tall too!

450
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,640
Camels also have stature.

451
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,400
OK.

452
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
No problem. No worries. It's possible.

453
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
Look at the neighborhood.

454
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,200
I had a dream last night, I hope it's okay.

455
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Such a lot of horses, they are running.

456
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,640
But I see that they tied cloths to the horses' shoes.

457
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,200
I say moon, how can these horses run with those cloths?

458
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,720
Your fate is tied to the moon.

459
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,000
Shut up girl.

460
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,160
Then the horses see me and start galloping towards me.

461
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,280
I look at the moon when I say they are running towards me.

462
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,720
On the horse is your girl Zeliha.

463
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,360
I'm afraid I'm running back and forth, I'm awake.

464
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,160
-I hope it is good. -What's up.

465
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,400
God, I don't know now. It was not such a strange dream.

466
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,120
God bless the moon. Will your sister or Zeliha fall into the wrong path or something?

467
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,160
Girl Songul, you are making everything worse, my girl.

468
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,120
If I get up, I will tear your face into pieces with the back of my slipper.

469
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,560
My rose.

470
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,520
[laughs] Love it, sister.

471
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,040
If you do this, your husband is right to turn away from you.

472
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,240
Who said it's cold?

473
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,080
You said to Aysel that she was lying on her bottom.

474
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,320
Elder sister!

475
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,800
[surprised] Ay, what? When did I say such a thing?

476
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,320
Girl Aysel called me the other day and said, "My brother-in-law doesn't click on Songul anymore."

477
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,600
"Well, the man is right." didn't you say -Said. Said.

478
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,960
Huh. I also have a witness.

479
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,120
[door closes]

480
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,000
[shouting out of breath] I'm in love.

481
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,000
Tonti, I'm in love, tontim.

482
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,000
Mother! I'm in love, mom.

483
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Aunt, I'm in love, aunt.

484
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,560
Aunt Makbule, get it for me.

485
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Henna engagement wedding, pretty much.

486
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,120
Talk about what you're going to wear at the wedding. Because I'm in love.

487
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,840
Come on horseback.

488
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,280
[takes a deep breath] We need to talk.

489
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,600
I can never look into your eyes.

490
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,400
But I have to say.

491
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
baby.

492
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,960
I fell in love with someone else.

493
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,280
Listen for a minute, don't say anything, listen.

494
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,760
We went to the fortune teller. with letters C, M, L inside

495
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,960
He said you will fall in love with someone.

496
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,560
Jamil.

497
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,880
What did I say the first day I pasted you?

498
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,480
I said don't trust me too much.

499
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,680
Here they eat the goods of those who do not eat. Squeeze, squeak, tsk.

500
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,160
No no, you will be happy too.

501
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,480
You will have beautiful loves with other people.

502
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,920
You are already very worn out, the relationship has tired you a lot.

503
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,280
The edges are torn.

504
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,120
Already my grandmother is ashamed that you are looking at her while she is praying.

505
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,640
We always cover your face.

506
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,400
If you don't look, I will do it more easily, don't look at me. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

507
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
[poster tears off]

508
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,520
You only have one eye left.

509
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,680
Bye bye Kenan.

510
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,960
Welcome, Jamil.

511
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,240
Good Morning.

[joyful music begins]

513
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,160
[kissing sounds]

514
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,240
Good morning Tony.

515
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,000
[jumping sound]

516
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,280
[door handle breaks]

517
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,840
[kiss voice]

518
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
[ani akan su sesi]

519
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
[kiss voice]

520
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,240
I'm so happy.

521
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
[door slams, key falls]

522
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,120
[joyful music ends]

523
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,160
[shouts] Eve. Eve.

524
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
Eve.

525
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
[glass breaks]

526
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,320
What happened to the moon, Zeliha?

527
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,760
Be downstairs in three minutes.

528
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,960
[neighbor] God.

529
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,720
[cries out loudly] He's gone. Who broke this glass?

530
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
Ben.

531
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,640
It's weird when you fall in love, uncle.

532
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,360
So what?

533
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,600
It's weird when you fall in love.

534
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,480
AA. Ill mannered.

535
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,760
-So you want a flat white like that. -Oh, such solid color, white.

536
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,000
Shall I make delicate roses in between? It would be very nice.

537
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,720
Brother, no, no. No pattern needed.

538
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,240
What about such tiny tiny, tiny tiny wildflowers?

539
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,280
-It would be great. -Brother, I'm straight...

540
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,280
What are you objecting to son? Tiny tiny, tiny tiny man lay it out.

541
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,400
Even if it's my grandmother's house, brother, it's a photography studio.

542
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,240
Shall I make rosy pink cameras? The mana will be huge.

543
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,160
Brother, you don't understand, let me explain to you.

544
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,120
You're painting this wall straight, okay?

545
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,040
Look, I don't want this shop job anyway, for God's sake, don't force it.

546
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,280
So we gave up the flower for sure, right?

547
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,680
Hah brother, there are no flowers.

548
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,560
You're going to paint it plain white. It's over, it's gone.

549
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
-Bird? -Bird?

550
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,400
There are...

551
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,160
Your bird is not finished. It's not over, your bird, your insect.

552
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,160
-Who is he bragging about? -No, its air is for itself. Uff.

553
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,000
Hişt.

554
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,480
Repentance astaghfurullah.

555
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,960
-Something has happened. -What happened?

556
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,320
-Something happened to you. -No, what happened, what happened?

557
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,640
Why did you run past us like that yesterday?

558
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,200
No, I didn't run. Why should I run?

559
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,960
You talked to a kid inside, and then you ran home.

560
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Is it Jamil?

561
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,400
No. No, no.

562
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,160
My grandmother called. She liked a boy.

563
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,680
He texted the boy. The boy did not answer this.

564
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,160
He said come on to the phone together, he said let's blow.

565
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Don't lie, Zeliha. Tell the truth.

566
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,400
You were impressed by that boy, weren't you? Was her name Jamil?

567
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
-Ha? -Camil?

568
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,880
Jamil. C, M, L.

569
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,400
-Mother, is that Cemil? -Who is Cemil?

570
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,520
Ah, it's going.

571
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,920
-Aunt? -Is she an aunt?

572
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,280
-Yes, aunt. -How does he look like Cemil?

573
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,920
So why did you call me?

574
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,280
To get some air.

575
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,280
Come here, there's a place to get some nice weather.

576
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
[music starts]

577
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,800
-What are we doing here now? -We're not doing anything, we're getting air.

578
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,640
Why do we look in those directions and get air?

579
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm not looking anywhere.

580
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Brother, come on, okay, white. Come on, that's enough.

581
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,640
Ana Cemiller is getting whitewashing done, look.

582
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,160
-Ha. Here is that boy. He's got the shop. -Oh, it was.

583
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,320
-Come on, let's go for good. -No.

584
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,440
Let's not go to his feet, let him come.

585
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,560
I'll say something.

586
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,160
If I touch that leaf, let Cemil say hello. But as a friend.

587
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,920
Ha?

588
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,840
Oh, I didn't.

589
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,640
[sighs]

590
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,240
Brother, where are you looking?

591
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,080
What is he doing?

592
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,400
Son, this girl is a very young girl.

593
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,000
-Who? That bouncing curly, brunette one. -Yup.

594
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,680
Let him go, he's crazy, he's crazy.

595
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,520
I really like it.

596
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,680
-Is he looking? He never looks, he never looks.

597
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,880
-I think you're not telling. -Ya Zeliha, why shouldn't I tell you if she looks?

598
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,000
-Looks, looks. -Swear.

599
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,640
How many times has he looked? Did he look three times or five times?

600
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,960
Did he look like a lover?

601
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,200
Did he look like he was saying come, did he look like he was saying go?

602
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,640
Tell me!

603
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,680
Okay, what did you exaggerate?

604
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,120
I will go and say good luck to your shop. What is there to exaggerate so much?

605
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,480
Allah Allah.

606
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,920
[brush sounds]

607
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,840
Your shop is open.

608
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,640
What do you call a shop?

609
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,560
Where did you find that shop?

610
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,000
Which shop?

611
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Have you ever been in a wedding?

612
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,720
-Mother, what am I saying? -What does that say?

613
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,320
I don't understand what she is saying, but she is a very sincere girl.

614
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,960
I'm Zeliha. We met at the real estate agent the other day.

615
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,960
-I remembered. -We met too.

616
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,400
You know, there was a fight in front of your Greek aunt's house.

617
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,000
-How did you get used to the neighborhood? -Wall.

618
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,080
This neighborhood is good. It is beautiful. Everyone loves everyone.

619
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,680
I have things I don't like.

620
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,840
Our women have entered the menopause.

621
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,760
From carbohydrates, we have slightly wider hips.

622
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,240
Men are henpecked.

623
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,080
My mother also sweats a lot.

624
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,280
He's also from menopause.

625
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,040
My love life is not good.

626
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,200
I've never had a girlfriend before.

627
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,120
Last night, Kenan and I parted ways. We always talk about them.

628
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,680
-I get it, the wall. His hand is a... -It's nice, it's slippery.

629
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,720
It's wet. Paint has been applied there, it's new.

630
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,840
Ha?

631
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Ana.

632
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,520
I say, is there a damp?

633
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,560
God, the face is gone too.

634
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
[fake laughs]

635
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,040
No, nothing will happen.

636
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,960
White suits me.

637
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,040
They say it opens.

638
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,560
Like a wedding dress, maybe.

639
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,080
Ha?

640
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,840
Which I think even a shroud would suit me.

641
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,440
[gets angry] What did you do, sister? Have you no respect for art?

642
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,000
- [quietly] Hush, okay. - [shouting] What are you yelling at?

643
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,280
What are you shouting? Nothing happened, what happened?

644
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,560
-Sister, you ruined the wall. -I normally

645
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,080
I'll lay this man on the ground and step on his face.

646
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,680
But now you have just arrived, it would be a shame.

647
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,160
I come and lay it on the ground for a while,

648
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,880
I will walk on it. pu. [spits]

649
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,680
[sad music begins]

650
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,040
-What happened Zeliha, your face is white? -My blood pressure dropped.

651
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,640
No, really white.

652
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,760
-Mother, I'm white. -Why did you purse your lip?

653
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,880
Am I shrunken?

654
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,680
I'm shrunken. It means I'm sad.

655
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,360
Wait, let me call Fatma sisters. Let's meet in the park, let's talk. Is it OK?

656
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,240
[sad music ends]

657
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,280
-[sings playing the organ] - One eye is looking at the ground

658
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,080
One eye looking at the ground

659
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,480
-Brother, you are not allowed to make music here. -Reason?

660
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,120
-You are disrupting the mental health of the society. -I don't go here or there.

661
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,440
What Zeliha?

662
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,120
OK, OK, I'm coming.

663
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,440
Guys, let's speed up.

664
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
[moving music starts]

665
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,440
[music ends]

666
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,400
-She fell in love with this boy. -Which kid?

667
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,240
Here's to the kid who's new to the neighborhood. He does not accept whether his name is Cemil or what.

668
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,360
I liken love to frogs' legs. Wet, loose.

669
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,520
Fevzi, stop.

670
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,520
Look, Fatma sister, her hands are painted on the tape from excitement.

671
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,360
Is the child interested in it too?

672
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,560
Sence?

673
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,600
Said the fortune teller. C, M, L said.

674
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,320
It's Jamil.

675
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,960
Fevzi, please shake me.

676
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,960
-Zeliha. -Ha?

677
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,800
-Are you okay? -I'm good.

678
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,480
Is there anything you want to share with us?

679
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,800
No.

680
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,200
-I will ask. -No, don't ask. He doesn't answer.

681
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,320
Zeliha.

682
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,880
Are you in love with this boy now?

683
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,480
[dropping sound] Zeliha!

684
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,400
Did something happen, Zeliha?

685
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,640

A retarded rascal, a scumbag. Keep your eyes on Cemil.

Shut up, turn it.

He doesn't want me.

892
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,600
-Like the others, "My son." said. -Bad bastard.

893
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,040

What do men think of themselves?

897

We can also fight if necessary.

[shouting] If this Cemil doesn't fall in love with you, I'm not Eve either.

903
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,920
Lan started talking this loudly, nothing got in it, huh?

904
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,280
-We see it, we watch it on the news. -Shut up and listen.

905
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,640
Plan one: You will go where Cemil went. You're going to pretend it's a coincidence.

906
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,480

Look, we were coming to the same barbershop. Do you see? Coincidence.

914
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,000
Cavit Abi, I'm going to get those eyebrows removed too.

How can I know?

927
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,600
I'm already in the game, I forgot the kid.

928

00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,640
-You know, he's your brother. -Of course it will. Good evening.

1031
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,960
What are you doing there, in the apartment?

1032
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,280
We were waiting for you. What happened?

1033
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,400
-What, what happened? -What happened with Cemil's brother?

1034
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,560
What happened?

1035
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,040
We had fun.

1036
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,880
-Your mouth is in your ears. -Indeed.

1037
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,520
Me.

1038
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,880
I had fun, after all, he's his brother.

1039
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,000
It seems to me that her brother is looking at you differently.

1040
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,080
As if.

1041
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,920
He is my mother-in-law, my mother-in-law.

1042
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,480
my brother-in-law.

1043
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,640
Was it my mother-in-law? What was it?

1044
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,360
But what do they call this mother-in-law?

1045
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,040
Whoa!

1046
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,040
Don't be silent, I'm scared.

1047
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,800
-Something superfluous has happened. -What happened?

1048
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,240
Isn't there a Velev Bar in Beyoğlu? This is live music.

1049
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,520
How will we know?

1050
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,080
I'm an old bartender, we used to go. There is also live music.

1051
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,720
I will sing there tomorrow night.

1052
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,880
The owner of the place "Come, let's try, let's listen." said.

1053
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,520
How nice. be happy. Be what you always wanted.

1054
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,120
-I don't think it's right for people to be happy. -Let's go, let's go, let's sell the mother.

1055
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,160
Zeliha, what are you going to do? Tomorrow you will call Cemilleri, this is a good opportunity.

1056
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,920
We will succeed. God help us. disperse!

1057
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,480
Let's break up.

1058
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,080
-Good job. -Thanks. Welcome.

1059
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,640
This will sing at Velev Bar in the evening, and you can support.

1060
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,920
-So it's not really necessary... -Of course, what does it mean?

1061
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,920
If we're going to support, we'll come for sure. I'll take Cemil as well.

1062
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,400
-Come on girl, we'll have a lot of fun. -If we're going to have a lot of fun, we'll definitely come, girl.

1063
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,440
What are you doing?

1064
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,520
What should I do, Cemil didn't want it. I howl at each other at the photos.

1065
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,680
He.

1066
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,360
Actually, if you squat that bride and put the groom on her back.

1067
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,160
It seemed to me that something much sweeter would happen, don't suck.

1068
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,160
I swear I will do that, you know? Our tastes are unbelievably similar.

1069
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,240
Now you need to do a very natural make-up.

1070
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,920
Far.

1071
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,080
I've never driven before.

1072
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,120
Whoa.

1073
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,480
Whoa. I wish I had driven.

1074
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,080
Blusher. two poofs

1075
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,200
I think that's enough.

1076
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,800
Whoa.

1077
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,920
Whoa.

1078
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,200
Whoa. I'm so beautiful.

1079
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,160
I'm pretty good. Jamil.

1080
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,640
Hello. I've never kissed anyone before.

1081
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,040
But I will kiss you.

1082
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,840
Girl! [kiss voice]

1083
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,520
What are you doing? Are you kissing the mirror?

1084
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,800
I have. Me.

1085
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,080
My grandmother was fond of a boy. The boy wanted to kiss it.

1086
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,560
My grandmother didn't kiss me.

1087
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,040
The child made a trip to this, my grandmother left.

1088
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,600
Born?

1089
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,400
I say my grandmother didn't kiss me.

1090
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,600
They are separated. My grandmother is crying inside.

1091
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,520
Their relationship is over. So my grandmother found it early, so she didn't get kissed.

1092
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,520
You go kiss.

1093
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,760
Come on, I ran.

1094
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,120
[They play horon with overalls]

1095
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,800
- Fatma sister, what are you doing? -Girl Zeliha.

1096
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,400
At my friend's wedding, the horon kicked in.

1097
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,320
I couldn't get over it either, because I was overweight.

1098
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,760
It stayed inside me.

1099
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,800
I said, now I'm at least weak, let me shed my worms.

1100
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,520
Either walk, walk.

1101
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,240
Walk.

1102
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,280
Come on.

1103
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,160
-We'll go inside. -Is there a reservation?

1104
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,560
-No. -You are not very suitable here, my sister.

1105
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,520
But we have to go inside, brother.

1106
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,760
Let's go, my sister. Come on, don't bother me. Let's.

1107
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,080
İdris.

1108
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,600
-Girl, isn't this Idris? -Who is Idris?

1109
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,200
Ay, aren't you the son of Aunt Sevcan?

1110
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,640
[kiss voice]

1111
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,080
I can't hurt you.

1112
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,680
You've grown this much and you're waiting at the gates?

1113
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,120
Well done, work well. Earn your bread.

1114
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,160
Say hi to your mom for us too.

1115
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,760
Fly fly.

1116
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,560
I'm not Idris.

1117
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,080
[loud animated song plays]

1118
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,960
This is a very warm, fun place, huh.

1119
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,760
Well done, Fato. How did you know the boy?

1120
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,320
I don't know girl. I said number.

1121
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,120
But there is an Idris I know.

1122
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,960
I don't like her mother at all.

1123
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,840
The woman comes to the day, what's up, she secretly puts it in a napkin

1124
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,240
then it was gone.

1125
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,920
Ayol once stole a towel. One also says

1126
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,600
The boy took out a sty and says I bought it from him.

1127
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,640
Look. Look. Look. When a sty comes out, copper is stolen from the house.

1128
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,920
This towel says this as an excuse. Ill mannered. Dense.

1129
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,840
We never listened to you.

1130
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,240
[in a low voice] Zeliha, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

1131
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,960
It's an environment I'm afraid of. Why did we come here?

1132
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,600
You came for your friends, Eve. My elderberry. The future of Fevzigil.

1133
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,480
What happened? Get out now.

1134
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,360
No, what happened to the brave warrior, huh?

1135
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,840
Tayyar slapped you girl, let me remind you.

1136
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,160
[loudly] You reminded me and you were right.

1137
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,880
Fevzi.

1138
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,320
Hello.

1139
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,120
Ayy, Fevzi. Can I drink beer?

1140
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,960
I'm sick of it, it's so cold, cold.

1141
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,240
Drink it, Fato. Let's unwind a little today.

1142
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,720
-Here you go. -One beer.

1143
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,920
One beer.

1144
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
-I'll have an apple juice, my volume. -One apple juice.

1145
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,960
-I'll have a little tea. -A tea.

1146
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,080
[boss whistles]

1147
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,320
Fevzi Bey, you can go on stage.

1148
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,160
[reads quickly] A beer, a tea, a water, apple juice.

1149
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,840
Whiskey Coke, 2 beers, one raki.

1150
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,080
-Come on quick, come on. -Ulan, say it slowly.

1151
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,280
Whiskey with cider? Who is drinking these?

1152
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,720
[cheers]

1153
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,040
Death is blowing in my face

1154
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,560
Oh, uncle loved me so much.

1155
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,640
My shroud is tatty

1156
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,680
Oh, what a bitter apple juice. But it was good, it was nice to drink.

1157
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,640
I carved your name on my coffin

1158
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,240
-What are we doing here? -Our friend is on the stage, son.

1159
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,560
- Come on, die with me . -Aha, the crazy girl is here too.

1160
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,720
Is it called crazy? Rude. Hello.

1161
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,480
Has it been out long?

1162
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,200
come on die with me

1163
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,040
The stage looks better from here, doesn't it?

1164
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,160
Yes.

1165
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,880
Whoa.

1166
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,240
I touched your leg. It was warm. Is love labor?

1167
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,480
Girl Zeliha.

1168
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,200
I think you should sing too.

1169
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,280
He is very impressed.

1170
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,520
Are you saying so?

1171
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,560
I carved your name on my coffin

1172
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,240
-My brother, if you go there? -Make your brothers laugh.

1173
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,880
Enter Fevzi. "Always Later."

1174
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,560
[Fevzi starts playing the song]

1175
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,880
[cheers].

1176
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,880
I felt like singing a song.

1177
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,960
Come to my love.

1178
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,600
He knows himself.

1179
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,120
Neither you are Leyla nor I am Majnun

1180
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,120
Neither you are tired nor I am tired

1181
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,720

1183
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,440
- You are neither Leyla nor Mecnun - Brother, I ran away.

1195
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,360
-Long live my beautiful, long live. -It's just that the lady is bothered.

1196
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,440
But wait a second, the lady is bothered.

1197
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,040
-What's going on with you? His wife is on her way to me. -Who is the wayward rude man?

1198
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,960
Ana, there was a fight.

1199
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,640
Mother, a fight broke out.

1200
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,520
-What are you doing? break up. -Let me go, I'll kill you.

1201
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,720
[shouts]

1202
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,040
-Zeliha. -Ha?

1203
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,040
You're going to hold it to your eyebrow, not your mouth.

1204
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,240
I'm holding your eyebrow, Eve.

1205
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,240
It's a shame they beat it so much.

1206
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,040
-Your voice is beautiful, Zeliha. -Oh.

1207
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,400
Why did you fight?

1208
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,680
I was afraid something would happen to you. -I'm a boy girl. I protect myself.

1209
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,120
No. You don't need to protect yourself when you're with me. I protect you.

1210
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,280
Reason?

1211
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,040
[slurping sounds]

1212
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,480
Actually, you're a good boy too, huh.

1213
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,400
You are kind hearted.

1214
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,960
I can call you a man to fall in love with.

1215
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,920
No man has ever loved me, you know?

1216
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,560
But I think very soon I will be loved.

1217
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,880
I think so too.

1218
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,760
-I loved you very much. -Me too.

1219
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,760
Hoop soup man, is your soup hot?

1220
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,920
Aa bebeto came, huh.

1221
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,840
Aaaaa.

1222
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,920
-Deliha'ylan ekürisi. -Deliha sensin lan.

1223
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,200
Hush girl Eve.

1224
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,880
Even if you give me justice for the sake of that soup maker

1225
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,280
I wish I could sleep well even if I go. Ha?

1226
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,520
-I do not. -It doesn't. Even if he does, I won't.

1227
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,200
[whispers] Look. Look. Now look.

1228
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,320
Hişt Tayyar.

1229
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,600
Let's be an ugly.

1230
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,480
I'm telling you, girl, don't do this. Do not do this.

1231
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,320
What do you smell girl?

1232
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,560
Zeliha, you are currently drinking garlic instead of soup.

1233
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,440
Ana.

1234
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,800
Whoa.

1235
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,480
But can I say something?

1236
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,280
It had a sharp taste.

1237
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,120
It's not that bad.

1238
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,600
Ana.

1239
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,440
It felt like something was happening to me right now.

1240
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,880
What happened to you?

1241
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,920
Eve brought me the quintet of hearts. What happened to you, huh?

1242
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,280
Then let the song that is playing now come to all of us.

1243
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,120
What's your name, what's your name...

1244
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,000
His blood pressure dropped.

1245
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,080
[Laughs]

1246
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,400
Get up girl, get up. Can you sleep until these hours?

1247
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,920
-What happened? -Faik sent an executive paper.

1248
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,400
He was going to kick us out of the house. Now he sees that day.

1249
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,160
Hush stop. Don't go to the woman. I will come too. They kidnap.

1250
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,400
What does this room smell like?

1251
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,240
Garlic.

1252
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,080
-Look at me, Faik Efendi. -Tell me, my smile.

1253
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,520
Are you seriously kicking us out now, huh?

1254
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,760
What if we don't talk about this in front of that crazy guy?

1255
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,000
-We rent you. -You don't give what you have to give, my rose.

1256
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,720
-You have no right to kick us out of the house. -The house is mine, you know?

1257
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,680
But don't worry. First, I will take out Mrs. Efşopşiya.

1258
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,200
After that, I'll take you out. Be comfortable.

1259
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,880
Aysel.

1260
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,960
And did I ever tell you about my widow fantasy?

1261
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,320
Ill mannered.

1262
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,840
Hisht bana bak bana.

1263
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,480
Well, you know my realtor fantasy?

1264
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,400
Let me explain.

1265
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:38,160
Now three steed-like men throw you in a car and take you to the mountain.

1266
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,480
They find a big tree on the mountain.

1267
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,600
That's how they tie you down.

1268
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,360
While you look with your groaning eyes, don't do it brothers

1269
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,880
they don't hurt at all, they pull their pants down.

1270
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,520
-Go girl, walk. -Then when you say ah woah...

1271
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,160
-I will explain it to you practically. -I'm telling you to walk, walk.

1272
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,760
-Pompish. -Okay, walk.

1273
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah yeah. Come without wasting any time, mother. We want a girl for me tomorrow.

1274
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,240
Born?

1275
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,720
I'm in love, mom.

1276
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,040
I will marry.

1277
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,880
Yes, the girl is beautiful.

1278
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,920
I don't know the shoe size, mom. Skip it, it's tomorrow. Lets.

1279
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,720
Let's kiss. Lets.

1280
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,680
What's going on bro?

1281
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,320
Son, we want Zeliha for me tomorrow night.

1282
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,520
-Who, that crazy girl? -Don't say that, son.

1283
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,200
So sweet girl. Very brave girl. I love you so much.

1284
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,040
Are you sure bro? He didn't seem very interested in you, though.

1285
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,640
It didn't seem like that to you though.

1286
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,720
What did he say while singing last night?

1287
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,840
“He knows himself.” He looked at me. said. I know myself.

1288
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,600
-Good bro, if you're sure. -I'm sure of course.

1289
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,440
We will be very happy, son. Don't get involved. Let my mothers want it tomorrow, let it be over.

1290
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,920
-Good luck. -Let's see, I hope.

1291
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,680
Come on, go home. Close the door too.

1292
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,920
who are you? Ha?

1293
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,600
Who are you to kick us out of the house? Stupid!

1294
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,560
Dirt.

1295
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,040
Ugh. Everything is coming together.

1296
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,400
-What's going on, Zeliha? -Faik kicks us out of the house.

1297
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,280
Cemil is not interested in me. I remained like Malak.

1298
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:04,160
Whoa. I guess I'll be a winemaker. It's all over.

1299
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,000
I love these flavors.

1300
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,400
Hello. How are you Zeliha?

1301
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,840
What happened to your mother's face?

1302
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,600
-Girl, there was a fight yesterday and they beat me. -I don't remember at all.

1303
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,880
I will say something.

1304
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,480
We say that we will come to you for a good job tomorrow evening, as a family.

1305
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,640
Should we come?

1306
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,440
-To who? -To you?

1307
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,160
-Is it for a good deed? -Yup.

1308
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,960
-Is it family? -We said so.

1309
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,400
-What time shall we come? - Come around eight, I think.

1310
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,000
Like eight. Okay, done.

1311
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,640
Whoa. He sent word with his brother.

1312
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,360
-Whoa. -I wonder?

1313
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,400
I wonder if what I'm afraid is not happening to me. This is Cemil's brother.

1314
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,160
- Don't you get burned by Zeliha? -Hush girl.

1315
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,280
[car approaches]

1316
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,440
Shall I take you for a walk on the beach?

1317
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,080
-Uncle Kasım, is your car running? - That lad fixed it.

1318
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,960
-Which lad? -The lad in the photo studio.

1319
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,120
The most handsome and kind hearted man in the world.

1320
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,120
He's coming to ask for me tomorrow night. Whoa.

1321
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,720
[joyful music begins]

1322
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,880
[joyful music ends]

1323
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,880
-How are you? -We're fine, you?

1324
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,399
Thanks. Good.

1325
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,640
-How are you? -Thanks. You?

1326
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,240
We're fine too, thanks.

1327
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,359
-How are you, my son? -I'm fine thanks. You?

1328
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,439
I'm fine, fine. Are you my child?

1329
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,680
Thanks, I'm fine too. Thanks a lot, you?

1330
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,160
-I am fine too. -Masallah.

1331
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,479
-You're fine too. -Thanks.

1332
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,160
-Very good. You? -Everybody is fine.

male rhino falls to the ground.

[they cough]

1337
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,160
This sexual intercourse, which is now rare,

1338
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,200
makes rhinos tired.

1339
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,439
Our grandmother always watches such documentaries.

1340
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,640
[laughs]

1341
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,640
Ha?

1342
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,080
what do you say mom?

1343
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,399
My Zeliha, make us coffee if you want.

1344
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:18,680
Yes, of course.

1345
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,960
My God, I am so happy.

1346
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,200
Eve, I am so happy.

1347
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:33,120
I eat you girl.

1348
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,200
Look, you'll end up marrying whoever you want.

1349
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,840
Zeliha, I'm going to say something.

1350
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,680
-I wonder if this is Cemil's brother... -Havva stop.

1351
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,880
Look now, I'm going to hold my hand to the fire. If I hold on for five seconds, we will marry Cemil.

1352
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:48,200
Which is already obvious.

1353
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,520
One two Three.

1354
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,479
Whoa.

1355
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,280
I couldn't stand it.

1356
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,800
Why did that happen?

1357
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,680
Tayyar, go.

1358
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:01,840
[whispers] Tayyar, go.

1359
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,040
Girl shut up. Did we come to you? Gee!

1360
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,080
-Eve. -Go, Tayyar.

1361
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,240
-Have a right to Eve. -Don't, Eve.

1362
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,520
Well, if you make your right, I won't give you my right.

1363
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,400
Hişt Fact. Fact.

1364
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,600
Are we putting salt or pepper on this Cemil's?

1365
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,800
They came to ask for me three times. I put salt in all three of them, salt.

1366
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,400
Oh, I'll put pepper then.

1367
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,400
Well, auntie, did someone you know die recently?

1368
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,640
Me.

1369
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,480
You also have a dead energy.

1370
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,840
Allah Allah.

1371
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,480
Well, we came here in such a hurry, don't suck.

1372
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,760
Our boy insisted.

1373
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,040
good luck.

1374
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,080
So you shouldn't be in a hurry, sucking.

1375
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,640
Here the children loved and liked each other.

1376
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,800
-Our Zeliha is also a good girl. -Yeah yeah.

1377
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,640
If you spill, I'll piss on your mouth, huh.

1378
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,040
Zeliha. What are you doing?

1379
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,000
[laughs] Oh girl.

1380
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,600
Thanks girl.

1381
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,920
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1382
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,320
Health to your hands.

1383
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,880
[in a low voice] Sir, I don't want this girl.

1384
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,800
This is something crazy. Let's get out of here reluctantly.

1385
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,920
Is there such a thing? We've come this far.

1386
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,480
The child loves it.

1387
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,640
[in a low voice] I love it.

1388
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,120
-Sorry. -[mother coughs]

1389
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,000
-Halal, halal mother. Halal. -Give it, bro.

1390
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,960
Sir, the children loved each other. -We loved it.

1391
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,120
We are here to fulfill our duty.

1392
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,440
With the command of Allah, with the words of the prophet

1393
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,600
We want your daughter Zeliha for our son Cemal.

1394
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,280
Ha? Is it Jamal?

1395
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,600
Cemil, my uncle Cemil, is divine.

1396
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,480
-No, my cousin. to Cemal. -No, Cemil.

1397
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,080
Daughter, the older one is Cemal. The little one is Jamil.

1398
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,760
Is there such a thing? to Cemil.

1399
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,080
I did not understand. Is Cemil's name Cemal?

1400
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,200
Okay, we are making love with Cemil, brother.

1401
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,440
Born?

1402
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,560
What does it matter?

1403
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,880
One minute, one minute. I don't understand now.

1404
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,640
Who do you want Zeliha for?

1405
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,560
We want me.

1406
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,960
Zeliha!

1407
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,800
[Laughs].

1408
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,120
-I wasn't even going to laugh. -Shst. Shush.

1409
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,320
Maybe there is a misunderstanding then.

1410
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,400
One minute, one minute, one minute.

1411
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,120
What am I doing with you, are you crazy girl?

1412
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,200
[arabesque music begins]

1413
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,320
[tray falls noisily]

1414
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,200
Get out.

1415
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,200
[arabesque music ends]

1416
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,120
I've never seen anything like this. What rude people.

1417
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,400
says Jamil.

1418
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,560
Son, didn't you say we were in love?

1419
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,920
I misunderstood.

1420
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,720
Don't worry about it bro. The girl is an idiot, a maniac.

1421
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,560
I told you, didn't I? You went and believed it naively.

1422
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,160
What's wrong with you, what's wrong with you?

1423
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,200
What's it to you? I loved, I gave my heart, I wanted what to you?

1424
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,000
-Abi! -Abi, abi ya.

1425
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,680
I am your brother.

1426
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,040
I'm going to love one girl, and you're going to talk about her back and forth?

1427
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,720
You don't get it, you're naive, it's easy to fool you.

1428
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,240
Enough, enough.

1429
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,600
I have loved only one girl in my life.

1430
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,720
He didn't, what can I do?

1431
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,560
I'm the one who's in trouble.

1432
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,760
Let him think, it's a way to be left to me.

1433
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,840
Brother, okay, I'm sorry.

1434
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,640
It's time to commit suicide for Zeliha.

1435
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,240
If you don't, girl?

1436
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,920
-Did I drown? -[all in unison] Get out.

1437
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,280
Get out!

1438
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,000
Zeliha.

1439
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,160
My daughter.

1440
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,160
[door closes quickly]

1441
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,040
Zeliha! Zeliha, open the door, girl, open it.

1442
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,400
I will kill.

1443
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,600
I will kill myself.

1444
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:58,000
Is this okay? Can this be done to me?

1445
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,880
Zeliha, don't scare us.

1446
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,800
Go. Go from here.

1447
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,440
leave me alone.

1448
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,200
I will die alone.

1449
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,240
I will die in peace.

1450
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,080
Whoa. I'm on the verge of death, man. Whoa.

1451
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,520
Aysel Aunt, this time she will kill herself.

1452
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,520
What an aunt. You are the aunt. I am the same age as you.

1453
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,040
-Come on, trust God. -[water runs into the tub]

1454
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,320
Oh my blood pressure has dropped.

1455
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,280
I'm upside down, mom.

1456
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,520
Help, help.

1457
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,080
Oh, I can't die.

1458
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,520
I'm hanging myself.

1459
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,880
I'm dying too.

1460
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,920
Fevzi! Come put this on.

1461
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,320
Open up.

1462
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,440
[door opens loudly and key falls]

1463
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,920
-Am I dead? -[all in unison] Get out.

1464
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,440
I'm going to throw myself out the window.

1465
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,280
-[yelling] -Get out.

1466
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,440
Hard.

1467
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,760
Don't do it Zeliha.

1468
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,840
[jumps into the hall]

1469
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,400
Is the moon dead?

1470
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,120
I do not think so.

1471
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,960
What are you looking at?

1472
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,280
Look at me. Who cured me, huh?

1473
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,280
I wanted to die.

1474
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,720
I will try to kill myself again.

1475
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,120
I can't, I don't want to live.

1476
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,160
[phone rings].

1477
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,120
Sir Makbule?

1478
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,600
Are we sobered, Mrs. Zeliha?

1479
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,320
I don't know, let's see if we are sober?

1480
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,320
-Ha? Doctor. -Sorry.

1481
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,800
If I shoot you fifty lira

1482
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,160
Could you add a drop of cedar to this solution?

1483
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,640
-Is it serum? -He.

1484
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,160
Live long, huh?

1485
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,360
[laughs, imitating the doctor]

1486
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,720
damn! Are you kidding, huh? We're asking a serious question here.

1487
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,840
I'll break your hippopotamus oath. Stupid!

1488
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,120
Zeliha. Faik was getting Efpraksia out of the house. He's executed.

1489
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,440
There are three or four chairs there, is that on the record?

1490
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,720
You too, like that. Okay, done.

1491
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,200
We're only going to buy that chair, too, unfortunately, Mrs. Efşopşiya.

1492
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,600
-It's just a shame what you did, Mr. Faik. -What's wrong with you, son?

1493
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,440
Putting the old woman in front of the door...

1494
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,560
Dude, wait a minute, I'm talking bullshit. Wait a minute.

1495
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,960
Does it suit you to put the old woman in front of the door?

1496
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,480
Honey, look, don't get involved in things that are not your business.

1497
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,520
- Go take a picture. - Put that hand down, that hand...

1498
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,200
What the hell, are you going to beat me up?

1499
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,640
[Zeliha shouts]

1500
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,000
Aha! Deliha has arrived.

1501
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,600
Who the hell are you kicking out of the house?

1502
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,120
Look, speak right.

1503
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,600
I don't have a hangover, I hurt all over.

1504
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,160
Don't make me beat yourself up.

1505
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,360
Well done last night, you know?

1506
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,440
-Aha! He took the key to the jeep. -[jeep unlocked]

1507
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,920
Girl, Deliha!

1508
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,280
-Girl, come here! Deliha! -[Jeep unlocks]

1509
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,920
Look, girl, it's a shame. Give me the key, come on, Deliha.

1510
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,600
Hey Deliha!

1511
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,920
My daughter.

1512
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,200
Gel al, gel al.

1513
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,360
-Leave. Girl what are you after? -[laughs from the neighborhood]

1514
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,080
-Do you give the house or not? -I'm not giving, I'm not.

1515
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,960
Tear off your pants, guys.

1516
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,480
damn! Stop, stop, stop. OK, OK, OK. stop.

1517
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,320
What happened, Iffet, are you scared?

1518
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,240
My Deliha, my dear, my sweetheart, let's talk. Come on, lower the glass.

1519
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,480
Samim!

1520
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,360
Whoa! damn!

1521
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,000
-Okay, okay, I gave the house. -Shout for the whole neighborhood to hear.

1522
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,000
Okay, I'm giving the house, I'm giving it.

1523
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,200
-Scream more. -Efşopşiya Hanım, the house is yours.

1524
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,720
It's not Efchopsia, it's Efkoptia.

1525
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,920
Efkoptiya Hanım, the house is yours.

1526
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,960
[cheers]

1527
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,040
Thanks.

1528
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,640
[laughs] God! What a happy day.

1529
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,720
Do you give your right to Eve?

1530
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,640
-No. -He says no.

1531
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,160
So you tried to kill yourself, huh?

1532
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,800
[Speaks with a Greek accent] That's it. I don't want to live.

1533
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,160
What do you mean wanting to kill yourself vre pedimu?

1534
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,920
You are a young girl, my dear.

1535
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,200
But everyone saw vre pedimu.

1536
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,280
Cemil was in love with me. She was slowing down, wagging her tail.

1537
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,480
Well, his brother wanted you.

1538
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,800
Yup. Sly dog.

1539
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,320
baby look.

1540
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,440
-You made a mistake somewhere. -Where exactly did I do it?

1541
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:31,920
You may not see someone who truly loves you.

1542
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,320
You may not notice.

1543
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,120
But maybe his brother loved you.

1544
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,120
No, nobody loves me. Nobody loved me.

1545
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,800
maybe you

1546
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:48,040
You chose the wrong man. What do you say?

1547
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,560
-I'm thinking. -Think about it, though.

1548
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,880
[downloads shutter]

1549
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,880
No where?

1550
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,200
Mind your business bro. Let's.

1551
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,640
We're going to the country. To Şirince, to the wedding.

1552
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,800
Is that so?

1553
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,480
Come on, let's treat God.

1554
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,800
Bye bye, bye bye.

1555
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,880
Forgive me. Thanks for everything.

1556
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,200
Good job. Let's clear your way.

1557
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,360
Thanks.

1558
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,800
Hush, what happened?

1559
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,720
They were going to Şirince for their wedding. He would not return again.

1560
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,800
Girl Sevim what happened, what happened?

1561
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,320
This is Cemal, he was getting married.

1562
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,960
Dressed so cutely, they were going to their hometown.

1563
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,280
"I won't be going back ever again." said.

1564
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,840
What is it?

1565
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,600
Because of his sadness, Cemal was going to his hometown and had a lightning wedding with a cute girl.

1566
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,840
subscription!

1567
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,680
Eve.

1568
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,960
Hush girl, Eve.

1569
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,960
-Come on, make it right. -I do not.

1570
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,160
Tayyar shut up. I'm thinking.

1571
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,560
Zeliha girl, look what the young man left you.

1572
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,840
-Which lad? - The one who fixed my car.

1573
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,920
-Camil. -Not Cemil, Cemal.

1574
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,120
Is it Jamal?

1575
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,040
Let's see what Cemal sent.

1576
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,960
Yeah, now I'm wondering too.

1577
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,040
[tears the package]

1578
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,720
"I've always seen you like this. You are the sweetest girl in the world.

1579
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,320
Have a nice trip. Jamal."

1580
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,560
-This boy loves you. -Does she like it?

1581
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,880
Of course she does, Zeliha, don't you see? look at it.

1582
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,320
But no man has ever loved me.

1583
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,880
I do not know how to be loved. How can I understand?

1584
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:39,440
Who would love you, for God's sake? Take a look at this type of person first.

1585
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,040
Tayyar.

1586
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,440
Do you know why I'm annoyed with you?

1587
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,560
He?

1588
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,480
Because you always make fun of me like that, "Look at your look." you say.

1589
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,600
[emotional music begins]

1590
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,360
Would I want to be like this? Ha?

1591
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,680
When I was little, they dressed me in your little ones.

1592
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,400
I've always traveled like a man.

1593
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,560
"Mom dress." I said, "No money." said.

1594
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,720
You still laugh at me.

1595
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,000
Oh Zeliha.

1596
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,520
"Do you have a problem?" Did you ask, huh?

1597
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,560
I do not have a father. My father is dead.

1598
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:15,640
I thought if I became like a man, maybe I would protect my mother and grandmother.

1599
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:21,240
Zeliha, I'm sorry, I never thought of it that way.

1600
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:26,400
Men always called me my son. He said my haji. said Rambo.

1601
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,960
They also said memati.

1602
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,680
Hey, let me shit myself.

1603
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,760
None of them liked me either.

1604
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,520
Whoa.

1605
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,200
Am I now missing the man who loved me first and only?

1606
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,680
[emotional music ends]

1607
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,720
All because of that goddamn fortune teller. I turned to the wrong person.

1608
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,320
He said it had the letters C, M, L in it.

1609
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,280
Whoa.

1610
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,200
Jamal. C, M, L.

1611
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,720
There are C, M, L in Cemal too.

1612
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,840
Jamal. [moving music starts]

1613
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,040
Zeliha!

1614
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,600
Sketches!

1615
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,440
[moving music ends]

1616
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,320
Mother, the door is locked.

1617
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,600
They went to the wedding.

1618
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,840
Did they go to the wedding?

1619
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,320
This Cemal has thrown himself on the road from sadness.

1620
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,800
He used to have a lightning wedding with someone else.

1621
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,360
Did Yıldırım go to the wedding ceremony?

1622
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,160
-Where is it? They said in the hometown, in Şirince.

1623
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,880
-Whoa. It means Jamal is getting married. -Come on, girl Zeliha, we'll catch up.

1624
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,960
No, how are we going to go, Fatma sister.

1625
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,800
Let's jump.

1626
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,000
Uncle November.

1627
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,520
[joyful music begins]

1628
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,960
Go on.

1629
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,920
What happened, what happened?

1630
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,040
This crazy Zeliha and Cemal escaped.

1631
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,920
They became each other at night. Now they had to marry.

1632
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,920
Born?

1633
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:08,720
Girl Aysel, they defiled Zeliha. He went to marry.

1634
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,480
Let's go mom. Let it go, let it go. You open the window.

1635
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,240
Open the window, it's too hot.

1636
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,560
The moon is very hot.

1637
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,040
The moon is very hot.

1638
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,760
[Speaks with an Aegean accent] Wow wow wow, who do I keep seeing?

1639
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,720
-Did you know me? -I didn't know.

1640
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,800
Aren't you Cemal, the son of our Nesrins?

1641
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,120
I am an aunt.

1642
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,360
Didn't you know yet, couldn't you figure it out?

1643
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,880
No, sorry I couldn't make it out.

1644
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,200
Just give up, Jamal. You used to come when you were little

1645
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,240
"Aunt Hatce, what beautiful breasts you have." you would go hand in hand.

1646
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,920
-You couldn't get it out again? -I didn't know.

1647
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,480
-When are you getting married? -I won't get married, I don't think so.

1648
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,320
Look at me, so many beautiful girls, bitches are coming here tonight.

1649
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,720
Like one of them, I'll take care of you right away.

1650
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,840
It's possible.

1651
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,160
Look what I'll say.

1652
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,680
From now on, you will lie on your wife's nipples.

1653
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,960
You fall asleep playing it. He has no name.

1654
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,520
Brother, they want to have a photo taken in the village.

1655
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,440
I've been shooting since morning, I'm tired, you go.

1656
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,200
Am I a photographer son? Go get it yourself.

1657
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,640
Brother, come on, you'll lose your mind. Besides, our cousin's wedding should be a gesture of ecstasy.

1658
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:04,760
Give good.

1659
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,240
Thank you, Aunt Hatce.

1660
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,240
-If you had stopped, I just found you. -I will take a photo.

1661
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:13,480
Hush, come and go like this, you. sit down, sit down.

1662
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,640
Or are you Cemil, the youngest son of the Nesrins?

1663
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,040
-He is me. -Did you know me?

1664
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,080
-I didn't know. -Am I not your Aunt Hatce?

1665
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,480
When I was little, you used to come to my breasts, hand in hand.

1666
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,680
-Oh really. -You still didn't know?

1667
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,760
-No. -Tawba astaghfurullah, repentance.

1668
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,480
How long is Uncle November left?

1669
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,440
Whoa. It's rude.

1670
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,240
[in a low voice] I'll tell you, I'll tell you, blasphemy is a sin Zeliha.

1671
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,080
what's going on? Eve!

1672
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,480
I'm printing Zeliha, I'm printing.

1673
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,600
The girl had come to ask for me tee three years ago.

1674
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,640
This Aunt Feryal had a nephew.

1675
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,440
If you see him wearing such a tie, his bottoms are always filthy.

1676
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,240
Of course, when I saw this, I was disgusted, I said abo.

1677
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,440
-Give Eve her right. -I do not.

1678
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,560
Oh, if he does, I won't.

1679
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:09,600
If this Cemal gets married before I go, I swear I'll kill myself. Whoa.

1680
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,600
Whoa. There's something inside all of you.

1681
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,720
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

1682
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,760
Something happened to me.

1683
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:22,880
Oh thank god.

1684
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,680
damn! My dear Kasım Uncle is me.

1685
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,120
Damn, something happened to all of you in my dream.

1686
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,080
You were dressed as a wife, I swear.

1687
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:34,120
I'm telling you man. Wake up, wake up, what sleep is this, what?

1688
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,120
Finally. [tire bursts]

1689
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,040
[brake sound] What's going on?

1690
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,400
Uncle November?

1691
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,120
The tire burst.

1692
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,840
And. Lastik be.

1693
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,880
Like you...

1694
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,200
Get off.

1695
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,720
Whoa.

1696
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,360
It was old, of course.

1697
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,640
-There is no spare. -What do you mean, grandpa?

1698
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,920
We're going to the wedding. We can't be late.

1699
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,880
Whoa! I'm done.

1700
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,480
I will die unloved.

1701
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:16,440
Okay, okay, calm down. I'll take care of it.

1702
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,800
Girl Zeliha.

1703
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,560
Our Dürdanes also bought cars. 2002 model.

1704
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,840
Did you know they threw an air on the moon?

1705
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,960
They were going home for the holidays. You hold the car, stay on the road.

1706
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,400
-Fatma Sister. -Here you go, my rose.

1707
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,480
[shouting] Shut up.

1708
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,280
Come, come.

1709
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,200
-Well done, Tayyar. Walk. -What a beautiful month, we'll go wide, girl.

1710
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,240
Uncle November.

1711
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,120
-You take care of yourself, don't you? -I'll see, baby, I'll see.

1712
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,920
Take care.

1713
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,360
I will name my child Kasım, Kasımcan.

1714
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,600
Gel.

1715
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,240
November bro.

1716
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,960
Whoa.

1717
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,960
-Selamun aleykum. -Aleykum Selam.

1718
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,200
Welcome.

1719
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,320
Hello guys.

1720

1721
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,440
Eye Eye Goztepe. Eye Eye Goztepe.

1722
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,480
Let's see, let's laugh together. Today is the happiest day.

1723
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,960
Yup. [shutter sound]

1724
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,560
It was very nice. The classics are over, shall we move on to the concept?

1725
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,040
[With the Aegean dialect] It's okay, let's move on.

1726
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,280
God, come on girl. How eager are you?

1727
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,760
Come on, grab Nusret's tie then pull it off.

1728
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,760
[shutter sound]

1729
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,440
This was the best. It is clear that we will walk from here.

1730
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,920
Come on, come on girl, the whole weight of the house is on your shoulders, think like that.

1731
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,480
Get on top of it, Nusret.

1732
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,440
It was great, change places immediately.

1733
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,800
Come on girl, get on top of it.

1734
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,520
My sister-in-law, who resents this, pinches the bride's neck.

1735
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,960
Still, they're taking your son, don't let go of your arm.

1736
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,360
-Is this what happens in Istanbul? -Of course, it's the latest fashion.

1737
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,680
You are the eldest in the family. Open your arms like an eagle and put your weight on it.

1738
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,440
-Brother Ibrahim, you were idle. -Abo.

1739
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,680
You found it yourself. Come on, well done. "I never want to see it." gaze.

1740
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,600
It was very nice. Shall we build a tower?

1741
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,920
All right, let's do it.

1742
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,240
Yes, now the bride is running away and you are chasing them together.

1743
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,800
No progress, brother-in-law, stay put. Just let the arms play.

1744
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,080
Well done see, keep the wicked expression.

1745
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,760
masterpiece. The concept is: The bride is dead.

1746
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,440
Nusret is in rebellion. The family is devastated.

1747
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,520
Come on.

1748
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,840
Die, beautiful girl.

1749
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,280
Yup. Nusret, rebel, my son.

1750
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,600
Hanife, why are you miserable, my beautiful girl?

1751
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,800
You are my sight. But you have to be happy.

1752
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,480
Come on, let's.

1753
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,360
My aunt, let me see the crocodile tears, yes.

1754
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:45,280
Brother İbrahim, you don't have any respect for me, but have some respect for the dead.

1755
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,080
Come on, please take your position.

1756
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,680
-Abo. -Hah, well done.

1757
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:50,880
Unbelievable.

1758
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,840
When I was 19, I fell in love with a handsome, tall boy named Kadir.

1759
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:02,320
Whoever came to ask because I'm in love with him, I didn't face anyone for five years.

1760
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,640
Wow.

1761
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,640
Then they said he was old.

1762
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,120
So children, Kadir ate my life and my youth.

1763
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,360
You are the killer of my youth, Göztepe.

1764
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,000
You are the killer of my youth, Kadir.

1765
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,440
[in unison] Shame on you. Shame on you Kadir.

1766
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,440
Then for Fatma Abla, for love.

1767
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,920
[they chant together] Oooooo!

Only officer, we do not have such a trust.

1778
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,760
I decide it, my dear.

1779
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,920
-Who are you? -We are your hooligan.

Revolt against your regiment, out of spite, Göztepe commissioner.

1782

Let me go, my sister, for God's sake. Come on, come on. Let's.

Where are they going?

I understood everything, but what is this tuff?

1787
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,440
It's not ours, officer.

1788
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,080

Whoa. They came.

I will rot in jail before I get my love.

1795
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,880
I am like an unopened package, I am like a rose bud.

1796
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,200
Our load is too heavy, we cannot accelerate.

1797
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,160
- Let's throw the watermelons. -Yes, let's do it.

1798
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,200
Watch out, watermelon. Watermelon, be careful.

1799
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,320
No.

1800
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,480
Many sins. Don't throw it away, it's a blessing.

1801
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,800
True.

1802

We can't get enough of that anyway. You get off, go to the wedding, I'll come and find you. Let's.

Come on, what are we going to do, how are we going to go?

1828
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,680
We don't have money, we always gave it to gas.

1829
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,520
We will ask for a car.

1830
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,400
It's not enough to beg.

Oh my god, please don't get married.

1839

Oh, who are you? Where is Jamal?

01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,160
Who is Jamal, Nusret?

1846
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,720
My uncle's son, my love, had taken our pictures.

1847
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,280
Aha there.

1848
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,240

Welcome.

1852
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,000
Why did you come?

1853
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,640
I brought you this.

1854
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,600
I made it for you.

1855
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:46,480
Cemal, I didn't realize that you loved me.

1856
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:50,040
-I couldn't see it. -People see what they want.

1857
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,200
But he called me a fortune teller.

1858
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,080
Otherwise, I had a lot of fun with you.

1859
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,720
When we run into those birds, he's at the amusement park.

1860
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,320
Even Eve said, "You," she said, "were looking at Cemal very differently at the soup shop." said.

1861
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,440
-Zeliha, do you love me? -Ha?

Let's do it.

1872
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:43,840
Ah ah, look at the type our boy likes while there are pretty girls.

1873
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,600
But mom, it's okay now.

1874
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
-Are we done? -We've grown, we've grown.

1875
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:52,560
Fatma sister, are you okay?

1876
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,600
I am good. I'm also very good.

1877
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,800
Where is Fevzi?

1878
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,200
Excuse me, let me ask you something.

1879
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,400
Are you the girl side or the boy side?

1880
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:06,680
-Man, you? -I gave the bride's gold.

1881
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,280
I am my own. They invited me to come.

1882
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,160
Good thing I came.

1883
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,480
Shall we Dance?

1884
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,400
My God, you are great, my Lord.

1885
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,680
Come on, let's.

1886
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,320
You came, thank you very much.

1887
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,440
What happened? Curious?

1888
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,840
Of course I did.

1889
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,480
Then make it right, Eve.

1890
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,360
How important was it?

1891
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:37,280
Eve, look, my grandmother couldn't give me justice before she died.

1892
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:41,080
The patient was lying down. I asked, "Grandma, are you giving me justice?" said.

1893
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:42,640
He left without answering.

1894
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,960
I have a lump here since that day.

1895
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,080
Every time I get halal, I forget about that lump for a few minutes.

1896
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,200
What do I do?

1897
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,120
I do.

1898
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,680
Havva helal et be.

1899
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,520
I do, Tayyar.

1900
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,200
Don't say that girl, do it.

1901
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,320
I said I'm planning, I'm doing it.

1902
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,360
do you?

1903
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,840
Allah be.

1904
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,120
[kiss voice]

1905
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,200
-Zeliham. -Ha?

1906
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,840
I couldn't propose at first.

1907
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:23,680
Born?

1908
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,560
Will you marry me?

1909
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,360
When?

1910
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,520
Whenever you want.

1911
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,400
Whoa.

1912
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:43,800
Bride and groom,

1913
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,040
to all lovers

1914
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,680
I just wanted to sing my aunt's favorite song.

1915
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,640
- Well done Fevzi. -[everyone applause]

1916
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,880
[animated music player]

1917
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:11,160
I threw fire into the straw

1918
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,320
Look at the smoke, the smoke

1919
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:18,520
your cruel mother

1920
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,240
I brought faith

1921
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:25,640
squeak, whimper, shimmer

1922
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:29,160
Oh so coy and move

1923
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:32,360
squeak, whimper, shimmer

1924
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:35,960
Oh my hazel eyes move too

1925
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:47,320
[klarnet solo]

1926
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,720
I also put coffee in the cup

1927
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,280
say hi to your uncle

1928
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,720
If my uncle doesn't give his daughter

1929
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,120
Let the pickle in the cup

1930
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,720
squeak, whimper, shimmer

1931
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:52,800
Oh so coy and move

1932
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,480
squeak, whimper, shimmer

1933
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,560
Oh, you move so coyly

1934
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,000
[clapping and cheering]
