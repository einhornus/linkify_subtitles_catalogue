1
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,850
Imagine, I wake up in my own bed, at home,

2
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:29,899
and suddenly a woman is pouring water on me from a teapot.

3
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,901
I say, " Get out of here! "

4
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,460
And I say: "I won't roll out, roll out yourself!"

5
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:42,461
"Get out of here!"

6
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:48,697
You know, I was just confused with indignation.

7
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:52,700
Who are you? If the thief, why did you lie down?

8
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:57,092
A thief who got tired and went to sleep in a robbed apartment.

9
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:04,819
You know, Nadia, I didn't like you very much at first.

10
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:07,861
I just really didn't like it!

11
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:13,459
And how you disgusted me! It's terrible!

12
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:17,702
And you just seemed like a shrew to me!

13
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:04,064
Nadenka, I'm sorry.

14
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:07,303
I was wrong. Overreacting.

15
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:11,064
Nothing. Well done for coming.

16
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:14,304
Really?

17
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:18,304
"Thank you." "I thought you weren't coming."

18
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:22,305
Give me your coat."

19
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:31,505
Let's go.

20
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:40,826
"Is he still here?" "Don't put him out on the street!"

21
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:43,825
The first plane doesn't arrive until 7 am.

22
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:48,377
I could spend the night at the airport. Not a big bird!

23
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:53,146
Sit down.

24
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:58,061
- Well settled in, had dinner. "You can't just sit around hungry!"

25
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:03,142
Music... Very good. Great!

26
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:06,225
- Join us. "To you?" Thanks.

27
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:09,666
"Don't cling to words. "Can I talk to you for a minute?"

28
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:13,667
Just for a moment, please.

29
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:19,706
We'll call him a taxi and let him ride to the airfield.

30
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:24,907
On New Year's Eve, the taxi will arrive only in the early morning.

31
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:27,227
Then let him walk.

32
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:30,786
"Walking to the airfield?" "Yes, to the airfield.

33
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:32,026
This far away?

34
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:35,787
Do you feel sorry for him already?

35
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:39,788
Even my angelic patience is coming to an end.

36
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:42,468
Mine, too.

37
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:45,227
Maybe you've already had something going on?

38
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,787
Shame on you!

39
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,708
No one is asking you!

40
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,147
If you love a woman, you must trust her.

41
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,268
Nadia, stop this guy.

42
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,228
This is a wonderful woman as a person.

43
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:05,229
She's smart and a great cook. I ate!

44
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,421
Stop this guy, or it's all going to end badly!

45
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,710
She's tactful, she's beautiful, finally!

46
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,710
"I'll beat him up!" "Apologize to her!"

47
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,148
"What are you doing?" "What about you?"

48
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,829
Ippolit, stop it!

49
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,830
The scoundrel! I'll show you!

50
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,069
Only a fight wasn't enough!

51
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,910
Ask her to forgive you.

52
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,550
Why are we talking about "you"?

53
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:33,069
You're the defeated one!

54
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,829
Zhenya, stop it!

55
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,549
It remains to be seen who is defeated! You'll break your arm!

56
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,070
I'll break it myself, fix it myself!

57
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,230
"Zhenya! "Oh, he's already Zhenya!

58
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:45,109
Well, in your opinion, I should be Vasya?

59
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,070
Let go of your hand, I said!

60
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:49,070
Well, stop it!

61
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,550
Ask for your forgiveness.

62
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:54,552
Enough already!

63
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:57,830
Get off me.

64
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,510
I didn't want to hit him, he went first.

65
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,911
Now go away, both of you!

66
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:07,912
Both of them!

67
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:12,472
Both, so both!

68
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:17,392
I will remember this New Year for the rest of my life.

69
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:21,432
Please remember. Do your best.

70
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:25,792
"Please." "Oh, for God's sake.

71
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:29,833
"Please come through." "I'm in no hurry.

72
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,912
Stop making faces!

73
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:02,393
Tanya, I'll be right with you.

74
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:06,394
No, nothing happened.

75
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:11,554
I'll tell you later.

76
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:16,555
Well, then you're in.

77
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:25,914
"Which way do you want to go?" "I'll go there."

78
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:29,915
"I'll go there, then." "We're not on our way."

79
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:21,757
- So... "You were turned away."

80
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:25,757
We were both turned away.

81
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:36,796
Well, let's wait, I have plenty of time to get to the plane.

82
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:40,798
I have a day off today.

83
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,317
"It's not hot. "Yes, it's cool.

84
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:53,998
And your underwear, as I noticed, is unseasonable.

85
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,558
Grab pneumonia and aha...

86
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:01,117
"Yeah what?" - Fatal outcome.

87
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:03,798
And you have shoes with thin soles.

88
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,038
"So we'll die together." "I'm not going to die.

89
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,039
I can sit in the car.

90
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,558
Ippolit Georgievich, what do you think?

91
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:20,599
I'm not going to answer to you.

92
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,879
You look like you're talking about me.

93
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,438
Yes, about you, adventurer.

94
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,439
Nothing is sacred to you.

95
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,079
People like you stick your nose in everything.

96
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,119
They believe not in reason, but in impulse.

97
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,320
You're out of control!

98
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:39,393
For you, the main thing is not the mind, but the feeling, the impulse.

99
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,479
You are a threat to society.

100
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,320
Very flattering review.

101
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:49,079
"What do you think?" "Hot tea."

102
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,081
But still frankness for frankness.

103
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:56,120
You are welcome.

104
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:58,760
People like you are always right about everything,

105
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,600
because you live as you should.

106
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:03,080
As prescribed.

107
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:05,440
But that's also your weakness.

108
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:09,321
You are not capable of insanity. You can't do great things.

109
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:13,321
And life cannot be adjusted to a profitable scheme.

110
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:28,441
"Hooray!" "Cheers for what?"

111
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,682
I'm coming back, I forgot my briefcase.

112
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:35,082
"You made that up on purpose! "Why would I be cold?"

113
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,882
I'll get you a briefcase.

114
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:39,922
I don't trust you, I have a valuable broom there.

115
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:44,280
- Why did you go to the bathhouse? "You don't understand that?"

116
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:54,162
Hello there! Moscow? Galya?

117
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:58,164
Yes. Please ask, Lukashina.

118
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:02,243
He's already gone to the airfield.

119
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:05,403
A casual acquaintance.

120
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,643
Tell me, how did it get into your apartment?

121
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:11,843
I'll explain everything to you now.

122
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,164
Yesterday Zhenya went to the sauna.

123
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:20,114
To the bathhouse? Girl, which bathhouse? He has a bathroom.

124
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,564
They have a tradition.

125
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:27,564
He is with his school friends every year...

126
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:44,804
Have you known each other for years?

127
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:48,485
No, we met a few hours ago.

128
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:52,444
Look, I have the same address as him in Moscow.

129
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:55,765
25 3rd Stroiteley Street, apartment 12.

130
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:58,845
And he came to me as if I were his home.

131
00:10:58,846 --> 00:11:03,681
So you know his Moscow address.

132
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:09,046
You are welcome.

133
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,326
You don't have to worry.

134
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:22,327
Please don't specify it.

135
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:26,848
"Do you want me to help you?" "No, I don't want to.

136
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:34,408
My hands were cold.

137
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,167
Everything is much simpler.

138
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:41,926
The crook.

139
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:44,287
No, that's not how you understand it.

140
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:48,288
Galya, I'm begging you, don't hang up.

141
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:52,888
Zhenya is very nice, he is very kind.

142
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:57,088
Galya, I must say that I envy you a little.

143
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:59,728
Yes, I really liked it.

144
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:03,729
Well, forgive him.

145
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,528
Why are you defending him?

146
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,928
Are you married?"

147
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:24,369
Well, what does it matter?

148
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,329
Unmarried, then.

149
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,330
So, he flew to Leningrad to celebrate the New Year with you.

150
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,449
"How old are you?" "A lot.

151
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,410
"Last chance?" "Shame on you!

152
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,969
Am I ashamed?

153
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,009
I didn't steal your fiance.

154
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,243
Galya, you misunderstand everything!

155
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:51,570
You're a predator.

156
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,849
In the end, at the last moment, he will also leave you.

157
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:24,931
Sorry.

158
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:29,688
I'm sorry, for God's sake, I left your briefcase with a broom.

159
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,171
Galya called you.

160
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:36,572
Galya?

161
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:39,852
How did she know the phone number?

162
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:45,849
Oh, yes, I told her myself. Besides, you have a simple phone number.

163
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:50,012
I tried to explain everything to her, but she didn't believe me.

164
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:54,014
I told her you'd gone to the airfield.

165
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:59,452
In the sense...

166
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:03,454
Yes, thanks.

167
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:10,693
Well, I'm off.

168
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:14,694
"Have a safe journey." "Thank you very much."

169
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:24,044
Sorry again for intruding.

170
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:30,335
"Thank you." "You're welcome."

171
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,375
I went...

172
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:46,094
I just wanted to tell you...

173
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:50,096
What?

174
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,856
May I call you?"

175
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:58,095
Do you remember my phone number?

176
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:01,615
14-50-30.

177
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:05,616
Call us.

178
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,375
- Happy New Year! "Thank you."

179
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:13,376
- Happy New Year to you too. "Thank you."

180
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:19,376
And ... fuck me.

181
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:23,689
And ... how will you get to the airfield?

182
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:30,577
"The buses aren't running yet. "I'll get there somehow."

183
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:34,416
Well, go ahead.

184
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:38,417
Go ahead.

185
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:46,737
Well, what are you doing!

186
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:49,697
I'm leaving.

187
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,097
You're looking for an excuse to stay.

188
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:56,099
Yes, I'm looking for it, but I can't find it.

189
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:00,538
And I can't find an excuse to keep you.

190
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:05,099
"Do what?" "Really?"

191
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,298
Then I'll take off my coat and stay late?

192
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:30,100
Sit down.

193
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,340
"Come on." "No, no, nothing.

194
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,660
"Would you like some herring?" "No, no, thank you.

195
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:05,021
Maybe some champagne?

196
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:15,141
Let me sing you something.

197
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:19,181
Good.

198
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:23,181
Because the pause was too long?

199
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,061
That's probably why.

200
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:30,062
I don't really sing very well, but I love to sing.

201
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:47,060
"If you don't have an aunt."

202
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:52,063
Executes...

203
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:56,263
In general, the aria of the Moscow guest.

204
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:12,182
If you don't have a home,

205
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:15,183
He's not afraid of fires,

206
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:19,023
And the wife will not go to another,

207
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:24,735
If you have, if you have, If you don't have a wife.

208
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:29,263
No wife.

209
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:32,344
If you don't have a dog,

210
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,624
She won't be poisoned by a neighbor,

211
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,264
And there won't be a fight with a friend,

212
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:44,862
If you have, if you have, If you don't have a friend,

213
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:49,344
I don't have a friend.

214
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:52,944
The orchestra thunders with bass,

215
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:56,345
Trumpeter blows copper,

216
00:18:56,346 --> 00:19:02,102
Think for yourself, decide for yourself, To have or not to have.

217
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:06,425
If you don't have an aunt,

218
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:09,625
Then you won't lose it,

219
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:13,305
And if you don't live,

220
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:16,665
Then you don't, then you don't,

221
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,106
Then you don't have to die,

222
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:23,266
Don't die.

223
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:26,665
The orchestra thunders with bass,

224
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,106
Trumpeter blows copper,

225
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:35,944
Think for yourself, decide for yourself, To have or not to have.

226
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:40,787
To have or not to have.

227
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,948
That's it. That's it.

228
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:47,547
Problematic song.

229
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:50,026
I didn't just pick up my guitar by accident.

230
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:54,028
Now, as a gracious hostess, sing me something.

231
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:00,708
You don't like the way I sing.

232
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:04,708
Like. I was lying. I'm lying.

233
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:08,868
Always?

234
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,869
Almost.

235
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:21,909
Nice photo.

236
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:26,350
I like her too, even though she's almost 10 years old.

237
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:29,348
Ten years?

238
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:32,108
You haven't changed at all.

239
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:36,029
Lying again?

240
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,029
Almost none.

241
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,030
"Where do you work?" - In the clinic.

242
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,589
I accept patients.

243
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,590
Sometimes 30 people a day.

244
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:57,470
Bored?

245
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:01,544
Of course, but what to do, they are sick, they need to be treated.

246
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,030
All right, I'll sing it to you.

247
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,750
Even though you don't deserve it.

248
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:13,752
Thank you very much.

249
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:27,423
I like, That you're not sick of me.

250
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:34,388
I like, That I'm not sick of you.

251
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:39,833
What never Heavy globe of the earth

252
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:45,832
It won't float away Under our feet.

253
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:51,151
I like, That you can be funny,

254
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:56,025
Disbanded, And don't play with words,

255
00:21:57,473 --> 00:22:01,473
And don't blush A suffocating wave,

256
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:05,711
Slightly, Touching the sleeves,

257
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:12,353
Thank you With your heart and hand

258
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:16,665
For being me, Without knowing it yourself, you love it so much.

259
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:20,673
For my night's peace,

260
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,993
For the rarity of meetings By sunset hours,

261
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:29,626
For our negulyanye under the moon, For the sun is not over our heads.

262
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:35,465
For being sick, Alas, not by me,

263
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:42,670
For the fact that I, alas, am not sick of you.

264
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:53,474
Nadia...

265
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:59,472
I want to ask you something...

266
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:06,394
I have a request for you, perhaps a little impertinent.

267
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:10,195
But what is it?

268
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:14,196
You... don't get angry?

269
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:16,436
I will try.

270
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,955
And don't send me away?

271
00:23:18,956 --> 00:23:21,755
Well, if I haven't already...

272
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:25,757
"Do you want me to sing again?"- no.

273
00:23:29,997 --> 00:23:34,070
Let me take a picture of Hippolytus out of the closet

274
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:38,036
and tear it up?

275
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:42,038
No, you can't.

276
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:46,077
Are you very upset that he left?

277
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:51,518
"Why would you want to know?" "I'll ask you again."

278
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,516
Yes, I'm upset.

279
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,518
Are you sure about that?"

280
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:13,879
How old are you? 32?

281
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,157
"Thirty-three?" "Thirty-four."

282
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:23,159
Thirty-four?

283
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,878
And then everything, well, didn't work out.

284
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:32,238
Bad luck, it happens.

285
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,758
And then he appears.

286
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,599
Like this...

287
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Serious and positive.

288
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,958
Beautiful.

289
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,479
It's convenient.

290
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,159
Reliable.

291
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,879
Behind it, as if behind a stone wall.

292
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,881
Yes, and the groom is probably profitable, and friends advise...

293
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:58,479
"Watch out, don't miss it."

294
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,481
And you, it turns out, are cruel.

295
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:06,641
Excuse me.

296
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,001
I'm a surgeon, and I often have to hurt people,

297
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:18,201
so that they can live well later.

298
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:22,201
Do you feel sorry for your patients?

299
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:26,761
Sure.

300
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:29,881
Yes...

301
00:25:29,882 --> 00:25:33,881
I feel sorry for myself sometimes, too.

302
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:37,961
I come home...

303
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:41,962
I sit down in a chair and start feeling sorry for myself.

304
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:48,442
But this rarely happens to me.

305
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:51,642
Have you never been married?

306
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:55,522
Was. Half of it.

307
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:58,962
How's that? For which half?

308
00:25:58,963 --> 00:26:03,400
And so... We met twice a week.

309
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:09,763
For ten years.

310
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:14,243
And on Saturdays and Sundays I was left alone.

311
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:20,644
Since then, I don't like Saturdays or Sundays.

312
00:26:21,364 --> 00:26:25,364
In general, I don't like holidays.

313
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:30,724
Was he married?"

314
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:36,044
He is still married.

315
00:26:36,484 --> 00:26:40,485
Do you still love him?

316
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:44,364
No.

317
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:46,523
No.

318
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:50,525
Let's go get some coffee."

319
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:04,965
And I've never been very popular with women.

320
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:07,445
Since high school. My word of honor.

321
00:27:07,446 --> 00:27:11,445
We had a girl in our class Ira, nothing special.

322
00:27:11,685 --> 00:27:15,686
And so I fell in love with her, as they said at the time.

323
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:19,685
And she didn't pay any attention to me.

324
00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:23,445
Then, after high school, she married Pavel.

325
00:27:23,446 --> 00:27:25,605
For the one you went to the bathhouse with?

326
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:28,726
And instead of which you flew to Leningrad?

327
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:33,243
Yes. They got married, and I was invited to the wedding.

328
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,285
I was terribly worried and made a toast:

329
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:40,405
"Ira, I wish you to leave Pavel and come to me as soon as possible."

330
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:44,366
I was kicked out for that, of course.

331
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:48,883
- Are you and Pavel friends now? "We've been friends all our lives.

332
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:53,006
It wasn't his fault that she chose him.

333
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:56,327
He was just about to fly to Leningrad to see her

334
00:27:56,328 --> 00:28:00,327
celebrate the New Year.

335
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:05,128
Poor Ira, she was hurt too.

336
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:08,687
Why also?

337
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:12,688
I don't feel like a victim.

338
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:21,288
I'll go make coffee with pleasure.

339
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,648
Why you?

340
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:26,649
Because you sing beautifully, but you can't cook.

341
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,849
This is not aspic fish, this is some kind of strychnine.

342
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:36,208
"You've been praising me." "I was being sycophantic.

343
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:39,168
"You're not being very polite." "It's true.

344
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:42,729
I don't recognize myself, I'm getting impudent before my eyes.

345
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,529
In general, everyone thought I was shy all my life.

346
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,568
Everyone rides me, and my friends call me a mattress.

347
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,889
I think they flattered you.

348
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,929
No. I felt the same way about myself.

349
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,450
You were obviously being modest.

350
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:01,209
And now I can feel it...

351
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,210
That I was becoming a different person.

352
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,010
"More brazen?" "No, bold.

353
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:11,970
"More brusque?" "Determined.

354
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:15,770
"More cheeky?" "You can't guess.

355
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:19,771
I feel that...

356
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:24,772
Capable of anything.

357
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:29,130
Just some power,

358
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:33,284
maybe she was dozing and now she's waking up?

359
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:41,972
Maybe it's because we met?

360
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:46,211
Thanks to you.

361
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:48,772
Do you know what you're saying?

362
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:52,772
That I made a cad out of you.

363
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:56,572
This is simply unheard of!

364
00:29:56,573 --> 00:30:00,573
I've never been called a boor before.

365
00:30:01,453 --> 00:30:05,453
Nadia, I'm happy.

366
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:13,334
How can you be so persistent?

367
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:17,332
I do not know what I will do with it now!

368
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:21,334
Don't you dare... I myself.

369
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:33,734
"Nadia, what happened?" "Did you have a fight?"

370
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:36,774
My dear, was he a bully?

371
00:30:36,775 --> 00:30:38,533
Raised a hand against you?

372
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:41,573
And I made such a good impression!

373
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:44,253
And we old fools have our ears open.

374
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:47,054
"He's probably married." "Does he have a child?"

375
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,614
I'll explain everything to you.

376
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:52,533
What kind of news is this? Who called you?"

377
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:56,535
Let's get out of here." Go home, both of them.

378
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,534
Are you out of your mind?

379
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:00,574
She asked us to.

380
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:04,094
"Nadia, you'd better come to my place. "Give me your coat."

381
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,134
Give me your coat!" It's someone else's!

382
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:09,535
"I'm not letting her go anywhere!" "What a tone!

383
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:13,536
- The tone is normal. "Why are you running this place?"

384
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:17,616
Because I'm Hippolytus.

385
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:22,375
"What are you laughing at?" "Because you're lying.

386
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:24,015
Girls, don't believe her.

387
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,576
"Last time... "Don't believe her.

388
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:29,055
"You're sweating yourself out. "It's not Hippolytus.

389
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:32,695
This is a complete stranger.

390
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:36,697
She wouldn't spend the night with a strange man, would she?

391
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,855
"I came home... "Tell me about the bathhouse."

392
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:44,453
"And I saw it... "That I'm in your bed!"

393
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:48,929
- Tell me, this is already interesting. "I think we'll go."

394
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:53,056
- Zhenya, stop the farce! "Which Zhenya?" Where is he?

395
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:56,656
Did you bring Zhenya?! Divorce!

396
00:31:56,657 --> 00:31:58,617
"Shut up! "Quiet, quiet!

397
00:31:58,618 --> 00:32:02,618
You'll beat him up later. Well, tell me."

398
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:04,136
I'll ask him a question!

399
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:06,737
Girls, let's have a drink.

400
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:10,738
New Year's Eve, after all. Let's.

401
00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:13,457
Let's drink to friendship!

402
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:16,577
Come on, come on for friendship.

403
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:20,578
She's been lying on the floor all night."

404
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:23,898
Dear Nadia and Ippolit,

405
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:25,738
"It's not Hippolytus. "That's enough!

406
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:28,538
Stop it, this isn't funny anymore!

407
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:31,778
"Here you go." "I don't want to!"

408
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:35,779
I drink to the fact that in the new year you never quarrel.

409
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,138
We won't.

410
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:40,459
"Girls, I'm leaving with you. - Enough, I'm tired of it!

411
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,178
Calm down, Hippolytus.

412
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,298
Why don't you shout "bitter"?

413
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,619
It's bitter! It's bitter!

414
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,659
I won't kiss him!

415
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,659
This is inconvenient. Why do you refuse?

416
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,620
The people demand it!

417
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:48,302
Where are Tanya and Valya?

418
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:52,982
You have good friends.

419
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:56,982
"Did we switch to 'you'?" "A long time ago.

420
00:33:58,022 --> 00:34:02,023
Didn't you notice?

421
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:10,702
This is not a house!..

422
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:13,142
A passing yard of some sort!

423
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:17,144
Honestly, whoever it is, I'll kill you!

424
00:34:22,383 --> 00:34:24,702
Do the Sinitsyns live here?

425
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:26,383
What's your last name?"

426
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:28,623
Sheveleva.

427
00:34:28,624 --> 00:34:32,623
"We are Shevelevs, comrades! "We got it wrong again!"

428
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:41,425
"What's your last name?" - Lukashin.

429
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,823
"And your middle name?" - Mikhailovich.

430
00:34:45,824 --> 00:34:49,263
Evgeny Mikhailovich Lukashin.

431
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:53,265
Very nice to meet you.

432
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:03,824
"Where are you calling?" "To the airport.

433
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:06,945
I want to know when the second flight to Moscow is.

434
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:10,945
Have you decided to postpone your departure?

435
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:13,785
I don't want to leave, that's all.

436
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:18,985
Hello there! Girl, when is the second flight to Moscow?

437
00:35:22,546 --> 00:35:26,265
I see, but the third one?

438
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:28,225
And the third?

439
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,946
And the fourth?

440
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:35,940
The devil knows what! They leave every half hour.

441
00:35:40,627 --> 00:35:44,146
I don't understand why Do I have to leave?

442
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:47,386
What are you talking about?

443
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:49,986
I have to go to work on the 2nd.

444
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:53,226
We can take a walk in the afternoon,

445
00:35:53,227 --> 00:35:59,177
go to the Hermitage, and in the evening I'll leave.

446
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:02,787
By train.

447
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:06,467
You're being cavalier.

448
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:10,066
I don't think I invited you."

449
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:14,068
So what's the big deal? Invite them.

450
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:22,388
What for?

451
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:31,309
I can't do this, I feel like there are three of us.

452
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,589
Don't you dare touch him.

453
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:41,429
I won't do anything to him, just stick him between the books.

454
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,150
Okay, let him eavesdrop, but let's turn his back.

455
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:00,669
It's better when you can't see it.

456
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,149
Leave him alone!

457
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,069
You stand up for him as if he's as precious to you as a memory.

458
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,549
It's none of your business.

459
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,550
"Beloved Nadenka"?

460
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,789
Well, you know!

461
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:19,785
This is already going overboard!

462
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:27,550
"What are you doing?" "Let him get some air!"

463
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:31,551
It's good for him.

464
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,751
"Go and pick up Hippolytus." "I wouldn't think of it.

465
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:44,631
"I'm telling you again. "Don't tell me again!

466
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:47,510
"You should take the first flight. "And I'll fly!"

467
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:51,710
"And you'll fly!" "And I'll fly!" I'll fly!

468
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:57,233
I'm just going to shave."

469
00:37:57,713 --> 00:38:01,431
With a razor! And I'll fly.

470
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:05,433
By plane...

471
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:09,952
This isn't a barber shop.

472
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:13,191
Don't stop me from shaving. I'm overgrown.

473
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:15,992
I can't fly to my fiancee's house unshaven.

474
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:20,669
I completely forgot that you had a fiancee.

475
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:25,712
Run and open it.

476
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:29,714
It's probably Hippolytus, he's been gone for a long time.

477
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:50,154
He's already shaving with my razor!

478
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:08,915
Now, I hope he's gone forever?

479
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:11,835
thank god!

480
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:15,908
By the way, why is his razor here?

481
00:39:19,436 --> 00:39:22,635
You're flying to your fiancee, so fly!

482
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:26,394
"And this is my fiance's razor. "My ex-fiance.

483
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:28,635
There is no Hippolytus, there was and floated.

484
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:31,475
Where is he? Ippolit! No way!

485
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:35,156
And if he comes here again, I'll throw him down the stairs.

486
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:37,395
Upside down.

487
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:41,396
What right do you have to talk to me like that?

488
00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:44,516
Why are you interfering in my life?

489
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:47,156
You should be at the airfield long ago.

490
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:51,309
No, my train leaves late at night.

491
00:39:52,677 --> 00:39:56,677
So!.. Well, that's enough!

492
00:39:57,277 --> 00:40:01,828
I don't want to eat, I don't want to drink either.

493
00:40:03,077 --> 00:40:05,396
I want to rest.

494
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:07,797
I'm tired today.

495
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:11,798
- "Foggy morning"... "Then I'll leave!"

496
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:15,877
Good riddance. "Foggy morning"...

497
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:19,878
"Good riddance"...

498
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:24,238
- I will come, but with a policeman. "Bring the entire squad.

499
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,516
"Bring the entire squad."..

500
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:37,719
"Policemen"...

501
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,558
Hand me my coat."

502
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:47,559
I'd love to!

503
00:40:55,999 --> 00:41:00,000
Ask you.

504
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,919
"Not too tight?" "Fasten it."

505
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,920
- what? "Button your boots."

506
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,800
With pleasure!

507
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:16,800
Thank you for your trust.

508
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,880
Why are you yelling like that?

509
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:25,840
Be patient, my patient.

510
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:29,841
Second.

511
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:35,875
I've been dreaming about this all my adult life.

512
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:48,392
Don't try to rob the apartment. Please note that I know your address.

513
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:53,642
Let me go."

514
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:13,565
Taxi service!

515
00:43:25,886 --> 00:43:29,045
Actually, we don't put them in the parking lot.

516
00:43:29,046 --> 00:43:31,244
All right, where should I go?

517
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:35,085
"I have no idea. "Get out!"

518
00:43:35,086 --> 00:43:39,086
No, I have an idea.

519
00:43:39,446 --> 00:43:43,446
Let's go to the Moscow railway station.

520
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:15,368
Chief, are you free?"

521
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:38,561
Pour, pour glasses.

522
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,809
Who's lying, what...

523
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:53,369
Who are you?

524
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,128
Who are you?"

525
00:44:56,129 --> 00:44:58,648
I can guess...

526
00:44:58,649 --> 00:45:02,609
"I'm sorry... "Don't come any closer, or I'll scream."

527
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,809
I'll explain everything to you in a moment.

528
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,408
"Just don't move! "I'm not moving.

529
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:10,849
You don't have to be afraid of me.

530
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,889
Why are you here?"

531
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,609
How can I explain it to you?

532
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,690
My friends and I have a tradition.

533
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:22,922
In Moscow, every year on December 31, we go to the sauna.

534
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:27,331
Come on, turn out your pockets.

535
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:32,889
I stole only 15 rubles.

536
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,891
Sparsely populated. Put it on the table.

537
00:45:43,012 --> 00:45:45,250
Where are you?

538
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:48,570
Where did you disappear to?

539
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:52,572
Gotcha.

540
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:32,173
One to Moscow.

541
00:46:32,174 --> 00:46:36,173
I asked Ash,

542
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:40,374
Where is my favorite?

543
00:46:41,654 --> 00:46:45,332
Ash didn't answer me,

544
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:49,334
Shaking his head.

545
00:46:50,014 --> 00:46:54,014
I asked poplar,

546
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:58,134
Where is my favorite?

547
00:46:58,934 --> 00:47:02,934
Poplar threw me

548
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:06,975
Autumn foliage.

549
00:47:07,695 --> 00:47:11,694
I asked autumn,

550
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:16,015
Where is my favorite?

551
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:21,176
Autumn answered me

552
00:47:21,936 --> 00:47:25,935
Heavy rain.

553
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:29,695
I asked the rain,

554
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:33,696
Where is my favorite?

555
00:47:34,415 --> 00:47:38,489
Long rain tears poured down

556
00:47:39,496 --> 00:47:43,496
Outside my window.

557
00:47:43,816 --> 00:47:47,816
I asked the month,

558
00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:52,256
Where is my favorite?

559
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:57,337
The month disappeared in the cloud,

560
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:01,616
He didn't answer me.

561
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:05,617
I asked the cloud,

562
00:48:06,097 --> 00:48:10,098
Where is my favorite?

563
00:48:10,938 --> 00:48:14,937
The cloud melted away

564
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:19,138
In the blue of the sky.

565
00:48:20,378 --> 00:48:24,377
Friend you are my only one,

566
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:28,618
Where is my favorite?

567
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:33,538
Tell me where you've disappeared,

568
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:37,538
Do you know where she is?"

569
00:48:37,658 --> 00:48:41,659
Friend replied the devotee,

570
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:46,379
The friend replied sincerely,

571
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:50,619
You had a favorite,

572
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:55,659
You had a favorite,

573
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:59,740
You had a favorite,

574
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:03,979
And my wife became me.

575
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:18,180
I asked Ash,

576
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,341
I asked autumn,

577
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:26,940
I asked poplar...

578
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:35,380
Mother! Why are you sitting in the hallway?

579
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:39,260
I watch a criminal, and he entertains me with songs.

580
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:40,820
I'm the culprit.

581
00:49:40,821 --> 00:49:44,821
Happy New Year, Nadenka.

582
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:49,341
Mom, let's set him free.

583
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:53,540
Well, are you cold?

584
00:49:53,541 --> 00:49:56,261
No, I took a taxi.

585
00:49:56,262 --> 00:49:59,101
Where did you take the taxi to?"

586
00:49:59,102 --> 00:50:03,539
I bought you a ticket for the morning train.

587
00:50:06,182 --> 00:50:09,221
Did you buy me a ticket?

588
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:13,223
Thanks. I'm awfully grateful to you.

589
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:16,181
Lower shelf.

590
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:20,102
I don't even know how to thank you!

591
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:23,902
Saved me from having to wait in line.

592
00:50:23,903 --> 00:50:26,701
Thanks.

593
00:50:26,702 --> 00:50:30,182
Thanks.

594
00:50:30,183 --> 00:50:34,183
And although I do not have a very large salary...

595
00:50:41,303 --> 00:50:44,623
I'll go to Lyuba's to continue celebrating the New Year.

596
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,624
Thank you, you are a wonderful mom.

597
00:50:53,624 --> 00:50:56,263
See to it, Nadia, that you are ready for my arrival

598
00:50:56,264 --> 00:50:58,543
no third party started up.

599
00:50:58,544 --> 00:51:02,544
Don't worry about that I won't allow it.

600
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:10,864
If you remember, I promised you

601
00:51:10,865 --> 00:51:14,864
return with a photo of Hippolytus.

602
00:51:19,945 --> 00:51:22,664
"Oh, what a nightmare! "You're an adventurer!

603
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:25,425
"Oh, what a pity! "You're impudent!

604
00:51:25,426 --> 00:51:28,784
Oh, what small pieces!

605
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,224
"You shameless brat! "Of course.

606
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:32,985
"The bandit! "Of course.

607
00:51:32,986 --> 00:51:35,345
"Barbarian! "Of course.

608
00:51:35,346 --> 00:51:39,345
"You're an alcoholic. "Of course.

609
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:42,785
"You're awesome. "Yes, yes.

610
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:46,786
You know who?..

611
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,946
We won't open it.

612
00:52:00,947 --> 00:52:04,946
We're not home.

613
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:11,547
Whoever it is, we won't open it.

614
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,306
Strange people.

615
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:20,066
We don't open it, so we're not here.

616
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:23,947
And if we're at home and don't open the door,

617
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:27,948
so we don't want to see anyone.

618
00:52:32,388 --> 00:52:35,227
What tactlessness!

619
00:52:35,228 --> 00:52:39,229
What bad manners!

620
00:52:41,108 --> 00:52:44,667
This is just hooliganism!

621
00:52:44,668 --> 00:52:48,669
Out of spite, we won't open it now.

622
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:57,068
Be strong, Nadia.

623
00:52:57,069 --> 00:53:01,069
Are they out of their minds?

624
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:06,269
Be courageous.

625
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,749
I'll have to open it.

626
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,269
Otherwise, they'll break down the door.

627
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,708
Well, then I'll do it.

628
00:53:18,709 --> 00:53:20,309
Zhenya!

629
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:24,310
Get a grip on yourself!

630
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:31,350
Guys! And this is me breaking down the door.

631
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,310
I'm here...

632
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:40,311
I wish you a Happy New Year, Happy New Year.

633
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:43,590
Accept it... and so on.

634
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:46,990
I really want to eat! I'm hungry as an animal.

635
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:50,991
This is the first time I've seen you like this!

636
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:53,710
And this is my first time in this form.

637
00:53:53,711 --> 00:53:57,110
This is the first time I've seen myself like this.

638
00:53:57,111 --> 00:54:01,390
"A baby was walking down the street, I'm blue and cold all over."

639
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:06,741
Thin-soled shoes. Now he knows.

640
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:09,471
He knows everything.

641
00:54:09,472 --> 00:54:12,711
But there were people! Found it!

642
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:17,070
Sheltered, warmed up, robbed...

643
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:22,352
No, they picked it up and warmed it up...

644
00:54:22,872 --> 00:54:25,832
After all, life is an amazing thing.

645
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:29,833
Full of surprises.

646
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:34,033
Sorry...

647
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:39,112
This, by the way, is beautiful!

648
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:42,153
How can it be programmed,

649
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:46,153
expected, planned happiness?

650
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:52,973
Oh, my God! How boring we live!

651
00:54:52,974 --> 00:54:56,512
The spirit of adventure is gone from us.

652
00:54:56,513 --> 00:54:59,993
We stopped climbing into the windows of the women we love.

653
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:03,994
We stopped doing the big, good stuff.

654
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:10,630
How disgusting! This is your aspic fish!

655
00:55:15,235 --> 00:55:19,750
Next New Year's Eve I will definitely go to the bathhouse.

656
00:55:22,395 --> 00:55:26,395
Why wait a whole year?

657
00:55:26,675 --> 00:55:30,435
Right! That's the idea!

658
00:55:30,436 --> 00:55:34,435
Very true!

659
00:55:34,475 --> 00:55:38,476
Let me pass.

660
00:55:38,716 --> 00:55:42,716
Thank you.

661
00:55:57,956 --> 00:56:00,475
I think he opened the water.

662
00:56:00,476 --> 00:56:04,477
What for?

663
00:56:06,957 --> 00:56:10,275
Are you out of your mind? Stop it now!"

664
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:12,476
I won't even think about it!

665
00:56:12,477 --> 00:56:14,916
Do you know what you're doing?"

666
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,316
Don't get in the way!

667
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:19,597
Ippolit, you'll ruin your coat.

668
00:56:19,598 --> 00:56:22,676
Well, don't be petty, Nadenka!

669
00:56:22,677 --> 00:56:26,036
Ippolit, I beg you, get out.

670
00:56:26,037 --> 00:56:27,957
At least take off your hat.

671
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:31,958
And I feel good in my hat. And you wouldn't say anything at all!

672
00:56:35,118 --> 00:56:37,357
Lukewarm went!

673
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,431
On New Year's Eve, a person goes to the bathhouse.

674
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,478
This perfectly characterizes him.

675
00:56:44,479 --> 00:56:47,797
Then he gets drunk there on the occasion of his marriage.

676
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:50,237
This is also in his favor.

677
00:56:50,238 --> 00:56:54,239
Then they put him on the plane like a chock.

678
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:59,838
And he ends up in another city.

679
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,518
Rub my back, please.

680
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,278
Well, is it difficult for you, or what?

681
00:57:07,279 --> 00:57:11,279
Don't want it as you want it

682
00:57:11,479 --> 00:57:15,479
What can I do?

683
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:22,435
In this city, he gets another one.

684
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,840
Naturally, he forgets about the Moscow bride.

685
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:36,040
Gets a new one, the Leningrad one.

686
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:44,199
And all because he is a man of high moral standards.

687
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:46,839
Please stop.

688
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,560
Are you offended?

689
00:57:48,561 --> 00:57:50,880
No offense, it's true.

690
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:54,954
And you can't take offense at the truth, even if it's bitter.

691
00:57:55,681 --> 00:58:01,597
Nadia, in such a short time, the old can be destroyed,

692
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:05,842
and creating a new one is very difficult.

693
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:09,121
Must not.

694
00:58:09,122 --> 00:58:13,122
The end of New Year's Eve, tomorrow there will be a hangover.

695
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:16,481
Emptiness.

696
00:58:16,482 --> 00:58:21,193
The interesting thing is, you both know I'm right.

697
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:40,283
Sorry.

698
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:43,722
Where are you going?" You'll catch a cold!

699
00:58:43,723 --> 00:58:45,042
Leave me alone.

700
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:48,842
I beg you, don't go, stay.

701
00:58:48,843 --> 00:58:50,522
It's freezing outside!

702
00:58:50,523 --> 00:58:54,283
Maybe I want to...

703
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:58,284
Catch a cold and die.

704
00:59:06,764 --> 00:59:10,765
My God, I'm tired.

705
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:18,365
What a crazy night.

706
00:59:20,365 --> 00:59:24,364
If he shows up again...

707
00:59:25,964 --> 00:59:29,965
He'll set the house on fire.

708
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:34,365
And to be honest...

709
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:38,365
I really liked it.

710
00:59:38,565 --> 00:59:42,566
He said things that we don't dare say to each other.

711
00:59:46,846 --> 00:59:50,846
You're crazy.

712
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:52,645
Come to your senses.

713
00:59:52,646 --> 00:59:56,646
That's exactly what's happening to me.

714
00:59:58,366 --> 01:00:02,439
Lyuba's already going to bed. And it's cold on the stairs.

715
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:07,286
Was it you who doused Ippolit?

716
01:00:07,287 --> 01:00:09,446
He was now walking all wet.

717
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:13,446
He's the one who's wet with tears.

718
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:19,967
You've offended such a good person!

719
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:31,127
Oh, well...

720
01:00:32,688 --> 01:00:36,688
You should go."

721
01:00:52,688 --> 01:00:56,887
But the planes run every half hour.

722
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:07,289
Half an hour won't save anything.

723
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:19,129
This is ridiculous, just plain stupid.

724
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:26,450
We will never forgive ourselves for this for the rest of our lives.

725
01:01:28,049 --> 01:01:30,449
You need to be able to restrain your feelings.

726
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:32,809
What for?

727
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:36,730
Haven't we held back too often in our lives?

728
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:40,730
Understand, Hippolytus is right somewhere.

729
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:48,691
We're a little crazy.

730
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:57,451
New Year's Eve is over.

731
01:01:58,651 --> 01:02:02,652
And everything falls into place.

732
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:19,531
I want it in the mirror,

733
01:02:19,532 --> 01:02:24,652
Where is the haze and the foggy dream,

734
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:28,371
I elicit,

735
01:02:28,372 --> 01:02:34,369
Where do you want to go And where is the shelter,

736
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:39,972
I see

737
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:43,972
Ship's mast,

738
01:02:43,973 --> 01:02:47,972
And you're on deck.

739
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:53,331
You're in the smoke of the train, Fields, fields,

740
01:02:55,213 --> 01:02:59,214
In the evening complaint,

741
01:02:59,934 --> 01:03:03,934
Evening fields in dew,

742
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:09,974
Above them are crows,

743
01:03:10,614 --> 01:03:14,413
I bless you,

744
01:03:14,414 --> 01:03:17,853
I bless you,

745
01:03:17,854 --> 01:03:20,573
I bless you

746
01:03:20,574 --> 01:03:25,569
On all four sides.

747
01:03:26,695 --> 01:03:30,293
I bless you,

748
01:03:30,294 --> 01:03:34,295
I bless you,

749
01:03:36,135 --> 01:03:39,135
I bless you

750
01:03:39,136 --> 01:03:45,131
On all four sides.

751
01:03:57,896 --> 01:04:01,896
It's already morning.

752
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:04,216
I have a feeling,

753
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:08,216
that we had lived a lifetime together that night.

754
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,376
Pick up the ticket.

755
01:04:13,377 --> 01:04:16,976
I think it can be found.

756
01:04:16,977 --> 01:04:20,977
No, I'm not going by train.

757
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:30,297
Shake for 7 hours.

758
01:04:40,738 --> 01:04:44,738
You, please...

759
01:04:44,978 --> 01:04:48,457
Remember me.

760
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:52,458
You too.

761
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:57,697
Go, Zhenya, go.

762
01:04:57,698 --> 01:05:01,699
Can I kiss you good-bye?"

763
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:06,298
No, don't do that.

764
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:10,299
Don't, I'm begging you.

765
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:22,619
Let's sit in front of the road.

766
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:38,220
I stole your picture.

767
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:42,981
I am very pleased that you will still have my photo.

768
01:05:52,501 --> 01:05:55,460
And if the weather is not flying, can I stay?

769
01:05:55,461 --> 01:05:59,461
No, then take the train.

770
01:08:35,147 --> 01:08:38,306
How painful, my dear, How strange,

771
01:08:38,307 --> 01:08:41,547
Akin to the earth, Intertwining branches.

772
01:08:41,548 --> 01:08:43,907
That hurts, honey. How strange

773
01:08:43,908 --> 01:08:46,627
Bifurcate under the saw.

774
01:08:46,628 --> 01:08:49,227
The wound will not heal on the heart,

775
01:08:49,228 --> 01:08:51,747
Shed pure tears,

776
01:08:51,748 --> 01:08:54,227
The wound will not heal on the heart,

777
01:08:54,228 --> 01:08:56,867
It will spill like a fiery tar.

778
01:08:56,868 --> 01:08:59,108
As long as I'm alive, I'll be with you,

779
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:01,707
Soul and blood are inseparable,

780
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:03,827
As long as I'm alive, I'll be with you.

781
01:09:03,828 --> 01:09:06,388
Love and death are always together.

782
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:08,708
You will carry it with you, my love,

783
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:11,188
You'll carry it everywhere with you,

784
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,708
You'll carry it everywhere with you

785
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:16,628
My native land, sweet home.

786
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:20,468
What if I have nothing to hide from From an incurable pity?

787
01:09:20,469 --> 01:09:24,428
What if I have nothing to hide from From the cold and dark?

788
01:09:24,429 --> 01:09:28,547
After parting, there will be a meeting, Don't forget me, my love.

789
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:31,149
After parting, there will be a meeting,

790
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:34,109
We'll both go back, me and you.

791
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:38,110
And if I go into obscurity, Short beam daylight light,

792
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,269
But if I disappear into obscurity

793
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:43,709
For the star belt, Milky smoke?

794
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:47,711
I will pray for you, So as not to forget the ways of the earth.

795
01:09:47,911 --> 01:09:52,347
I will pray for you, I want you to come back unharmed.

796
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,670
Shaking in a smoky train,

797
01:09:54,671 --> 01:09:57,830
He became homeless and humble.

798
01:09:57,831 --> 01:10:02,426
Shaking in the smoky train, He was half-crying, half-sleeping.

799
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:05,470
When the train is on a slippery slope

800
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:08,990
Suddenly it bent with a terrible lurch,

801
01:10:08,991 --> 01:10:11,711
When the train is on a slippery slope

802
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:14,750
I tore the wheels off the rail,

803
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:17,110
Superhuman strength

804
01:10:17,111 --> 01:10:19,911
In one press of all crippling,

805
01:10:19,912 --> 01:10:22,391
Superhuman strength

806
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:25,950
The mundane was thrown off the ground,

807
01:10:25,951 --> 01:10:30,787
And you didn't protect anyone, The promised meeting is far away,

808
01:10:31,472 --> 01:10:36,627
And no one was protected by the Hand calling in the distance.

809
01:10:36,993 --> 01:10:40,151
Do not part with your loved ones,

810
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,991
Do not part with your loved ones.

811
01:10:42,992 --> 01:10:45,792
Do not part with your loved ones,

812
01:10:45,793 --> 01:10:48,792
With all your blood, sprout in them.

813
01:10:48,793 --> 01:10:51,712
And each time forever say goodbye,

814
01:10:51,713 --> 01:10:54,512
And each time forever say goodbye,

815
01:10:54,513 --> 01:10:57,712
And each time forever say goodbye,

816
01:10:57,713 --> 01:11:01,714
When you leave for a moment.

817
01:11:05,993 --> 01:11:08,793
Tell me what happened."

818
01:11:08,794 --> 01:11:12,233
I don't understand anything! I'm all excited!

819
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:15,312
Where did you go?"

820
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:18,553
Tell me, what's wrong?" Where is Galya?

821
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:22,233
I went to Leningrad.

822
01:11:22,234 --> 01:11:24,514
Where to?

823
01:11:24,515 --> 01:11:27,353
To Leningrad.

824
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:31,354
I'm sorry, for God's sake, I'm terribly tired and sleepy.

825
01:11:31,794 --> 01:11:36,107
So you ran away to Leningrad again?

826
01:11:37,395 --> 01:11:41,395
Mom, you know that.

827
01:11:41,995 --> 01:11:47,911
Every year on December 31, my friends and I go to the sauna.

828
01:11:48,155 --> 01:11:52,155
We bathe in the sauna.

829
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:55,154
We had a drink in the sauna.

830
01:11:55,155 --> 01:12:00,071
And me by accident, unintentionally, you know, but by accident,

831
01:12:01,236 --> 01:12:05,752
mixed up and sent to Leningrad instead of Pavlik.

832
01:12:07,836 --> 01:12:11,515
How was this sent?

833
01:12:11,516 --> 01:12:15,195
What are you, a parcel, a parcel, a suitcase?

834
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:19,196
Please, my head is breaking.

835
01:12:21,677 --> 01:12:25,156
Didn't you think straight?"

836
01:12:25,157 --> 01:12:28,475
No boom-boom.

837
01:12:28,476 --> 01:12:32,477
What a blooming flower you are! The horror!

838
01:12:32,997 --> 01:12:38,231
You need to get married so that you can listen to someone.

839
01:12:39,717 --> 01:12:43,476
Of course, it will be difficult for you to explain yourself to Galya.

840
01:12:43,477 --> 01:12:47,317
But never mind, I'll go right now and bring her here.

841
01:12:47,318 --> 01:12:51,318
I'm begging you, don't.

842
01:12:53,197 --> 01:12:57,198
You don't want to marry Gala anymore?

843
01:12:57,718 --> 01:13:01,077
I met another woman.

844
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:05,078
"Where?" - In Leningrad.

845
01:13:05,398 --> 01:13:09,398
"When?" "Tonight.

846
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:12,558
Oh, my God!

847
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:15,238
And that's why you're breaking up with Galya?

848
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:19,239
Yes.

849
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:23,718
Mommy, what's wrong?

850
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:27,720
"Mommy, what's wrong with you?" "Wait a minute.

851
01:13:28,919 --> 01:13:32,919
Has it passed?

852
01:13:33,919 --> 01:13:37,920
You're a womanizer. A womanizer.

853
01:13:42,639 --> 01:13:46,640
Oh, Mom, I'm an unhappy person.

854
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,880
Why am I so unlucky in life?

855
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,999
And I don't need to get married.

856
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,280
What for? Really?

857
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:02,320
Not necessary.

858
01:14:02,321 --> 01:14:05,799
No one will look after me better than you.

859
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,801
The sly one!

860
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:19,473
Imagine if we have a strange woman here.

861
01:14:21,241 --> 01:14:25,242
It remains to be seen how you'll get along.

862
01:14:28,522 --> 01:14:31,720
And whether you'll get along.

863
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:34,681
I'll get annoyed.

864
01:14:34,682 --> 01:14:36,241
No, that's all.

865
01:14:36,242 --> 01:14:39,881
Everything! To hell with it!

866
01:14:39,882 --> 01:14:42,961
Let everything remain the same.

867
01:14:42,962 --> 01:14:46,361
My poor child!

868
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:47,841
Lie down.

869
01:14:47,842 --> 01:14:51,562
Lie down, everything will work out.

870
01:14:51,563 --> 01:14:55,562
Lie down and rest.

871
01:15:07,283 --> 01:15:10,642
What's her name?"

872
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:14,644
She has an amazing name.

873
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:21,283
Nadia.

874
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:25,284
And most importantly, it is rare.

875
01:18:31,092 --> 01:18:35,091
Nadia.

876
01:18:44,012 --> 01:18:46,851
You forgot your broom.

877
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:49,531
How did you find me?"

878
01:18:49,532 --> 01:18:53,533
You're an impenetrable dumbass.

879
01:19:20,334 --> 01:19:24,531
My God, this is where the same thing starts!

880
01:19:25,013 --> 01:19:29,014
I hope it's not Hippolytus.

881
01:19:30,334 --> 01:19:33,613
Hello! Happy New Year!

882
01:19:33,614 --> 01:19:37,614
Happy New Year!

883
01:19:37,654 --> 01:19:39,053
Happy New year!

884
01:19:39,054 --> 01:19:40,413
Where is he?

885
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:44,415
Wake him up.

886
01:19:48,214 --> 01:19:50,814
Hello.

887
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:54,815
How could I have made a mistake? I never get drunk.

888
01:19:56,135 --> 01:20:00,136
I'm glad that you, Zhenya, and...

889
01:20:01,575 --> 01:20:02,894
Galya.

890
01:20:02,895 --> 01:20:06,896
That we are your friends, and Galya forgave you.

891
01:20:06,897 --> 01:20:09,735
Zhen, stop hugging.

892
01:20:09,736 --> 01:20:13,933
We can't stop. We haven't seen each other in too long.

893
01:20:14,495 --> 01:20:17,975
It doesn't bother me. Does it annoy you? Not me.

894
01:20:17,976 --> 01:20:21,135
Zhenya, we are glad that Galya forgave you.

895
01:20:21,136 --> 01:20:25,136
We are glad that you finally found Galya.

896
01:20:28,176 --> 01:20:31,856
Mother!

897
01:20:31,857 --> 01:20:35,857
My Nadia has arrived.

898
01:20:45,337 --> 01:20:49,337
Do you think I'm frivolous?

899
01:20:50,337 --> 01:20:54,337
We'll wait and see.

900
01:20:54,737 --> 01:20:58,738
"Do you understand anything?" "Is that you for me?"

901
01:20:59,738 --> 01:21:03,738
It seems to me that this is not Galya.

902
01:21:05,418 --> 01:21:09,418
Say something, you're the smartest one.

903
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:14,098
I can say that one of them is Zhenya.

904
01:21:15,418 --> 01:21:19,017
My friends!

905
01:21:19,018 --> 01:21:23,058
I am grateful to you for making a big difference in my life.

906
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:27,898
And that fate threw me to Leningrad.

907
01:21:28,299 --> 01:21:33,248
And that in Leningrad there is the same street, the same house

908
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:38,140
and the same apartment.

909
01:21:38,499 --> 01:21:41,138
Otherwise, I would never have been happy.

910
01:21:41,139 --> 01:21:44,579
We would never be happy.

911
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:48,580
Иначе мы никогда не были бы счастливы.

912
01:21:52,379 --> 01:21:56,380
I asked Ash,

913
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,500
Where is my favorite?
