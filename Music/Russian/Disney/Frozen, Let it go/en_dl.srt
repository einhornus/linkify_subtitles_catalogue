1
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:18,755
A blizzard covers the slopes of the mountain peaks.

2
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:22,550
And the ground is white.

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,929
Silent kingdom

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,862
I have become the queen.

5
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:36,771
And the wind groans and my heart is a hurricane.

6
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:44,043
I wish I could contain it, but I couldn't.

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,557
Not reveal, keep a secret

8
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:51,071
Be a good girl for everyone.

9
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:57,371
Lock up all your feelings

10
00:00:57,372 --> 00:01:00,347
But it's all in vain

11
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:03,056
Let it go and forget

12
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:07,843
What's past can't be undone

13
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:11,057
Let it go and forget

14
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:15,129
A new day will show the way

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,450
I'm not afraid of anything

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,528
Let the storm rage on

17
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:32,957
The cold has always been to my liking.

18
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,553
And I run higher and higher

19
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,528
On the icy surface.

20
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:42,519
And the fears of days gone by

21
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,442
Can't catch up to me

22
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:50,645
It's time to find out what I can do

23
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:54,286
I'll call the blizzard for the service

24
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:58,357
I'll be free on the ice

25
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:02,329
Forever!

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,557
Let it go and forget

27
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,986
The world of your dreams

28
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:12,857
Let it go and forget

29
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:16,529
And there will be no more tears

30
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,829
This is my home

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,129
My snowy home

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:33,819
Let the storm rage...

33
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,350
The air sparks

34
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,813
And the ground from my magic.

35
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:44,928
Frost and ice are in my power

36
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:48,471
What a marvelous gift.

37
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:55,629
And now I know how to go on!

38
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,986
I'm not going back

39
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:03,363
I've got to forget everything

40
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:07,029
Let go and forget!

41
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,858
And go up in the sky

42
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:13,515
Let it go and forget

43
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:18,100
Shine like the polar star

44
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,443
I'll see

45
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:26,227
My first sunrise

46
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:30,927
Let the storm rage on

47
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:41,286
I've always liked the frost
