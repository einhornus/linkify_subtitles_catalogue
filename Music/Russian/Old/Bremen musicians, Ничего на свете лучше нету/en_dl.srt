1
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:12,859
There's nothing better in the world,

2
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,728
Than wander around the world with friends.

3
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:20,477
Those who are friends are not afraid of worries.

4
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:20,490
We like to travel by any road

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:28,172
We like to travel by any road

6
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:30,211
La la la la la la la la

7
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:38,728
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, eh, eh, eh

8
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:42,570
We'll never forget our destiny:

9
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,699
We bring joy and laughter to the people!

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,714
And the tempting archs of palaces

11
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:58,670
We will never exchange for freedom

12
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:00,402
La la la la la la la la

13
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:09,042
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, e, e, e, e

14
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:12,199
Our carpet is a meadow of flowers,

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,228
Our walls are giant pines,

16
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:19,800
Our roof is the blue sky,

17
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:30,189
It is our fortune to live such a fate
