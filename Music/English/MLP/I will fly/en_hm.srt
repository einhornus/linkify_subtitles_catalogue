1
00:00:06,614 --> 00:00:09,783
When life gives you lemons

2
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:13,814
You can make lemonade

3
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,942
But life gave me Tank here

4
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:20,486
And my choice has long been made

5
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:24,257
No winter will come to Ponyville

6
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,843
I'll do it on my own

7
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:30,471
I will keep you by my side

8
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:34,789
So I will not be alone

9
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:38,071
And I'll fly, and I'll fly

10
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:41,888
Until the end of the sky

11
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:46,186
So I'll be the one who doesn't

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,770
Have to say goodbye

13
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,548
I'll clear the skies forever

14
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:55,600
So we won't be apart

15
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:59,128
I'll keep the weather warm for you

16
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:07,486
And the winter will never start

17
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:10,512
Weather-makers Pegasi

18
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:14,968
You make the seasons in the sky

19
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:18,205
I don't want to sabotage you

20
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:22,542
But you see, I've got to try

21
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:24,942
No winter can come here now

22
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:28,924
I'll keep the warmth and the sun somehow

23
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:32,199
I'm sorry, ponies, this has to be

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,013
For I need my friend and he needs me

25
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:41,085
I know it's wrong, but what does it matter?

26
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:42,843
'Cause nothing's gonna stop me now

27
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:47,036
I'll change it all, it's only the weather

28
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:49,943
And nopony's gonna bring me down

29
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:56,143
I'll keep the sunlight shining free

30
00:01:56,157 --> 00:02:03,106
And I'll bust the clouds apart so you can stay with me

31
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:05,238
And I'll fly, and I'll fly

32
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:09,108
Until the end of the sky

33
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:13,514
So I'll be the one who doesn't

34
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:17,500
Have to say goodbye

35
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:20,857
I'll clear the skies forever

36
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:23,456
So we won't be apart

37
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:27,129
I'll keep the weather warm for you

38
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:34,257
And the winter will never start
