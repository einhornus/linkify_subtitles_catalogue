1
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:09,783
When life gives you lemons

2
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:13,814
You can make lemonade

3
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,285
But life gave me Tank here

4
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:20,486
And my choice has long been made

5
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:25,323
No winter will come to Ponyville

6
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:28,253
I'll do it on my own

7
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:31,402
I will keep you by my side

8
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:34,789
So I will not be alone

9
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:38,870
And I'll fly, and I'll fly

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,888
Until the end of the sky

11
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:44,002
So I'll be the one who doesn't

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:48,400
Have to say goodbye

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,548
I'll clear the skies forever

14
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:55,725
So we won't be apart

15
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:58,536
I'll keep the weather warm for you

16
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:07,486
And the winter will never start

17
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:10,512
Weather-makers Pegasi

18
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:14,968
You make the seasons in the sky

19
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:18,205
I don't want to sabotage you

20
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:21,233
But you see, I've got to try

21
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,585
No winter can come here now

22
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:28,924
I'll keep the warmth and the sun somehow

23
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:31,973
I'm sorry, ponies, this has to be

24
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:36,013
For I need my friend and he needs me

25
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,724
I know it's wrong, but what does it matter?

26
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:42,112
'Cause nothing's gonna stop me now

27
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:47,036
I'll change it all, it's only the weather

28
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:50,353
And nopony's gonna bring me down

29
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:55,167
I'll keep the sunlight shining free

30
00:01:55,167 --> 00:02:03,106
And I'll bust the clouds apart so you can stay with me

31
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:05,238
And I'll fly, and I'll fly

32
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:09,108
Until the end of the sky

33
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:13,775
So I'll be the one who doesn't

34
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:18,353
Have to say goodbye

35
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:21,075
I'll clear the skies forever

36
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,192
So we won't be apart

37
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:28,181
I'll keep the weather warm for you

38
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:40,774
And the winter will never start
