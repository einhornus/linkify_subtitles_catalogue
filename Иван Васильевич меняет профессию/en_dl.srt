Ivan Vasilyevich Changes the Profession (HD)

2
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,712
Oh, shit!

3
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:18,424
Listen, what is it? The lights are out again.

4
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,713
What a mess! Timofeyev blew the fuses again!

5
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:27,938
- Comrade Timofeyev, when will it end? - I'm finishing it now.

6
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,031
I'm asking, when will your irresponsible experiments,

7
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:35,521
...which is resulting in de-energizing our whole building, do you understand?

8
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:39,826
If you only knew, Ivan Vassilyevich, what a most useful invention

9
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:43,205
what experiments I've been conducting, you wouldn't be talking like this!

10
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:46,250
Experiments with electricity, my dear comrade, should be done at work,

11
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:51,778
and at home electric energy should be used for peaceful, domestic purposes!

12
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:58,118
I am on vacation, so I work at home. My experiments are absolutely safe.

13
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:02,521
As a member of the public I declare to you: Stop it!

14
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:07,127
Today you burned the fuses, tomorrow you will burn down the whole house!

15
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,903
Well, we'll have to increase the voltage. Is it dangerous? Of course it's dangerous,

16
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,744
but the risk, as they say...

17
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:12,251
It's a hard problem to meet love.

18
00:06:12,396 --> 00:06:18,307
The planet goes round and round, round and round,

19
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:24,922
The planet is flying away Through the turmoil

20
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:32,324
It's not easy, it's not easy To love on it

21
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:39,206
The January blizzard is ringing and the showers are whipping hard

22
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:45,332
And stars rush in circles And cities make noise.

23
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:51,551
People don't see each other, they pass each other by.

24
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,895
People lose each other, and then they never find each other.

25
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:06,146
And somewhere there's my heartfelt love

26
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:12,444
Unrepeatable, eternal, eternal...

27
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:18,617
I've been looking for it, but in the hustle and bustle of days

28
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,453
It's not easy, it's not easy to meet her.

29
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:32,710
The January blizzard is ringing And the tide is whipping hard

30
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:38,724
And the stars rush round and round And the cities rumble

31
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:45,397
People don't see each other, They pass each other by

32
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:53,053
People lose each other... And then they never, never find them,

33
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:58,374
And then they'll never find each other.

34
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:21,986
I can't imagine what's going to happen now! I wish it wasn't a scandal!

35
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:25,650
They're exhausting, these scandals.

36
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:31,908
I've been divorced three times. I don't count Zyuzin.

37
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,355
I've never been so worried.

38
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:40,040
All right, let's go.

39
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:45,341
Oh, Shurik! Shurik! Your machine will ruin you.

40
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,871
My machine, Zinochka, will make me famous! And you, too! - Yes.

41
00:08:54,814 --> 00:09:00,651
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I have some terrible news to tell you.

42
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:07,451
My gloves were stolen from me at the cafe today.

43
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:11,342
And I fell in love with someone else. Do you understand me, Shurik?

44
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:15,663
- What gloves? - Not the gloves, but I fell in love with someone else.

45
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:21,416
But here it is! Don't contradict me and don't make a scene!

46
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:28,028
What? You're asking who he is? And, of course, you think it's Molchanovsky?

47
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:34,806
No, I don't. Zupperman? Wrong again. Well, all right! Let's not play hide-and-seek.

48
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:40,823
It's director Yakin! - Well, well, well.

49
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:49,329
This is weird, though. This is the first time in my life.

50
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:56,465
"They tell him his wife is leaving him, and he goes, 'well, well. It's not even polite."

51
00:09:57,057 --> 00:10:02,216
- He's, what's his name, blond, tall? - Well, that's an outrage.

52
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:07,265
Not interested in his wife like that! The blond one is Molchanovsky.

53
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:16,406
And Yakin, Yakin is talented. What? You're asking where we're going to live?

54
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,669
Today we're going with him to Gagra, to choose a place to shoot,

55
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:27,888
and then they should give him an apartment. Unless, of course, he's lying.

56
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,916
He's probably lying!

57
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:35,195
Ah, how silly! Out of jealousy to insult the man!

58
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:46,515
I pondered for a long time during sleepless nights and came to the conclusion,

59
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:53,818
that we weren't right for each other. Understand, I'm all about movies, about art!

60
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,204
I'm amazed at your calmness! And you know, Shurik,

61
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:11,011
it makes me want to have a scandal! - Don't. - You think so? - I'm sure.

62
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,887
Well, goodbye, Shurik.

63
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,978
Just don't discharge me yet. You never know what might happen.

64
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:34,301
Alexander Sergeyevich, tell Zinaida Mikhailovna...

65
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:40,535
I can't tell her anything, she's gone away.

66
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:44,895
- Gone where? - With her lover in the Caucasus. - What do you mean, with her lover?

67
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:50,250
And you speak so calmly about it? You're an original man!

68
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,174
But you have character! If I were your wife, I'd go too!

69
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:03,0003
If you were my wife, I'd hang myself!

70
00:12:04,0004 --> 00:12:05,349
Rude!

71
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:11,561
Dental clinic? Hello? Extension 3-62.

72
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:20,155
Could you please call Anton Semyonovich Shpak?

73
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:29,830
- Anton Semyonovich, for you! - Who's asking? - Some woman.

74
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:35,467
Don't shut your mouth! I'm listening!

75
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:41,303
Anton Semyonovich? Hello. What time do you work today?

76
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:47,517
This is an artiste speaking. No, I don't know her, but I'm dying to meet her.

77
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:57,987
So you'll be working till four? I'll call you again. I'm very persistent.

78
00:12:58,538 --> 00:13:00,578
I'm waiting.

79
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:46,538
That was my lucky entrance!

80
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:26,582
Citizens, keep your money in a savings bank, if you have any!

81
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:29,811
But what business is it of yours what happened to my wife?

82
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:34,225
Whether or not we divorce her is our own business!

83
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:39,517
It's a public matter. With your divorces, you're lowering our numbers drastically.

84
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:45,904
I'm asking you to hold off on getting a divorce until the end of the quarter.

85
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:49,347
And then divorce as much as you like.

86
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:54,404
When you talk, Ivan Vassilyevich, it's as if you're delirious!

87
00:14:55,907 --> 00:15:01,126
And again about your suspicious car. I beg you, report it,

88
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:04,839
or we'll report it ourselves.

89
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:12,265
There's nothing suspicious about this machine. I just invented a time machine.

90
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:16,849
In short, I can permeate space and go back in time.

91
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:19,483
- Go back in time? - To the past.

92
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:25,135
Such experiments are only done with the permission of the proper authorities!

93
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:30,616
The apparatus would be of unheard of benefit. I'll explain everything to you now.

94
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,371
Well, everything!

95
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:09,394
And now we will experience my time machine in action.

96
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:13,438
You are witnessing a historical event.

97
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:21,866
We will now pass through space.

98
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:09,331
- Did you see that? - What? Did you see? - What is it? What's the matter? What's the matter?

99
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:17,386
Where did the wall go? - What's the matter? There was a wall here just now!

100
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:23,622
Comrade Timofeyev, you'll answer for the wall according to the law. Did you see what machine was invented?

101
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,784
- Half of the apartment has disappeared! - Nothing has disappeared!

102
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:50,499
I've seen wonders of technology, but this!

103
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,057
- Excuse me, who would you be? - Who would I be? - Yes!

104
00:18:57,057 --> 00:19:01,956
- I'm a friend of Anton Semyonovich Shpak. - And what are you doing in his apartment?

105
00:19:02,0002 --> 00:19:04,770
Waiting for my friend. What did you think?

106
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:10,010
How did you get into his apartment if he's at work? - What a vulgar question!

107
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:19,019
You see, I got through time. I got what I wanted!

108
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:23,615
- So it's any wall you can take out? - The wall!

109
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,941
- Your invention is priceless! Congratulations! - Thank you.

110
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,585
Why are you looking at me like that, Father? I don't have any designs on me.

111
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:40,341
I have my doubts. You're wearing the same suede jacket as Szpaka.

112
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:47,476
Jacket? Suede? Isn't there only one Shpak in all Moscow who has a suede jacket?

113
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:53,981
- What's your last name? - I'm an artist of big and small academic theaters!

114
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:59,744
And my last name is too famous for me to mention it.

115
00:20:00,0000 --> 00:20:03,793
Perhaps you'd like to go back to Shpak's room? I'll open the wall for you.

116
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:08,298
No, no. I'd rather look at your car. I like it very much.

117
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,386
I'm very glad! You're the first to see it. You're the first witness, so to speak!

118
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:15,526
I've never been a witness before!

119
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:19,890
She's looking! You'll wipe a hole on me.

120
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:24,356
- Can you imagine what you saw? - You bet!

121
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:32,861
And in the store you can lift the wall? Ah, what a useful invention!

122
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:35,828
- And you came to Shpak with a tape recorder?

123
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:42,283
You see, bypassing all these walls, I can pierce space.

124
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:48,582
- I can go back 200, 300 years! - Yes, yes, yes.

125
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,054
- You ignored my question about the tape recorder. - Yuck on you!

126
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:58,938
Oh, what a machine! It really is a new word in science and technology.

127
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:00,523
Blast you again.

128
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:07,235
We're about to go back in time to see ancient Moscow!

129
00:21:08,0008 --> 00:21:12,118
Come to your senses, Comrade Timofeyev! Before, you understand, to see the ancient Moscow

130
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,830
without the permission of the proper authorities! - Wait a minute! - What is it?

131
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:21,870
- You interfere in the academician's experiments one more time, and you'll stand in the way of progress... - Understood.

132
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:26,714
Go ahead.

133
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:31,805
- I'm worried. - Courage, I'm here!

134
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:25,367
To the heavenly village... ...to the Reverend Abbot Kozma...

135
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:34,762
- Kozma... - The Tsar and Grand Duke of all Russia... ...of all Russia... - Cheers...

136
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:45,425
Write further!

137
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:52,601
- Look! This is Ivan the Terrible! - You go!

138
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:13,833
Demons! Demons!

139
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:19,960
Go away! Go away! Gone!

140
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:26,892
Alas for me, a sinner! Woe to me, the wretched murderer!

141
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:33,690
- Wait! Get lost! - Wait! - Go to hell! Evil force!

142
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:52,925
- Where are you going to call? - The police! - Put the phone down! - What?

143
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:58,686
- Put the phone down! - What? Hang up what? - Put the phone down! - I won't put it down! - Put the pipe down!

144
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:03,0003
- Why not? - Hang up the phone, I'm telling you! Hang up the phone!

145
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,0005
- I'll kill you, hat!

146
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:09,474
Where are the demons? Hit the demons!

147
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:22,691
Get down!

148
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,211
Wait! Wait!

149
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:37,740
Locked up, locked up, demons!

150
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:46,046
That's what the life-giving cross does!

151
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,010
Where is the tsar?

152
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,607
We need a snack!

153
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:36,137
Hurry up!

154
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:56,734
- Oh, how they scream! - They can't scream. They've been dead a long time!

155
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:07,166
- Have you ever seen a dead man shoot? - Open up, dog! - Who's he for?

156
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:10,752
- You! - Me?

157
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:48,926
Oh, this is hard for me! Tell me again, aren't you a demon? - I've told you a hundred times what I am!

158
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:52,260
- I am not a demon! - Oh, don't lie! You lie to the tsar!

159
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:57,602
Not by the will of man, but by the will of God, I am the King! - Very well!

160
00:27:57,603 --> 00:28:02,567
I understand perfectly well that you are a tsar, but... - Alas for me, Ivan Vassilyevich!

161
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:11,107
- Alas for me, sorcerer. Send me back! - I can't! Because of that damned golden eagle!

162
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:20,418
All the transistors have burned out, and until I buy them, I can't send you back!

163
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:22,022
Then buy them!

164
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:27,125
- Stores are closed, it's lunchtime. - Oh, woe is me! Oh, woe is me!

165
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:31,469
- Calm down, Ivan Vassilyevich! Oh, woe is me!

166
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:38,312
- Do you drink vodka? - Anise. - That's it!

167
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,731
Anisova, unfortunately, no. Stolichnaya.

168
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:57,198
- Drink up. - Taste from my cup! - What's that for? - Taste it!

169
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,505
You think I want to poison you?

170
00:29:04,0004 --> 00:29:10,010
We don't do that. And in this age it's easier to be poisoned by sprats than by vodka. Drink up!

171
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:16,975
- Cheers, boyar! - Bless you!

172
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:23,874
- Did the key-keeper make vodka? - Let it be the keywoman. Have a bite!

173
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:39,286
Did you make a car like that? I had one of those, too.

174
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:45,045
I made the wings. - Well, well? - Well? I put him on a powder keg.

175
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:50,510
Let him fly. - Why so cool?

176
00:29:50,652 --> 00:29:54,354
- I don't drink, Ivan Vassilyevich. Thank you. - Do you respect me?

177
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:58,912
- Jesus, Ivan Vassilyevich. - Then drink! - Just a little! Stop, stop!

178
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,615
- Well! Cheers! - Cheers!

179
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:14,598
So this is where you live? It's a small room!

180
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:18,986
- It's certainly no tsar's palace! - Yes, of course it is!

181
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:23,606
- And where is your noblewoman? Is she in church?

182
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:28,914
And my noblewoman ran away to the Caucasus today with her lover Yakin.

183
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:34,274
- You're lying! - By heavens! - Caught? - Ha. - If they catch her, I'll stake Yakin!

184
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:42,317
- Why, Ivan Vassilyevich? Why? They love each other and let them be happy.

185
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:50,530
Oh, you're a good man!

186
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:57,057
My God, why am I here and the Swedes took Kem?

187
00:30:57,396 --> 00:31:03,659
Boyar, send me back. Go and buy those transistors.

188
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:13,931
I'm busy! Call me later.

189
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:20,298
- I'll go with you. - Down the street? No, that's out of the question. Wait for me here!

190
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:27,154
- Only you, boyar, hurry up! - I'm in a hurry myself, I have to bring those two back too!

191
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:31,877
- What will happen to them there? - They'll cut off their heads and that's it.

192
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:34,683
- That's all, eh? - To hell with them!

193
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:47,639
Take demons alive!

194
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:00,0000
Stop!

195
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,554
Eureka! Czar's clothes. Get dressed! You will be king!

196
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:00,266
No way!

197
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:04,183
Get dressed, I'll kill you!

198
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:19,481
Talk to me, my seven-stringed friend,

199
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:27,564
My soul is full of you, And the night is so moonlit.

200
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:35,325
Oh, one more time, one more time, Many, many, many, many more times.

201
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:42,458
One more time, and many, many more times.

202
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:49,513
Cornflowers in a clear field, A long way off.

203
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:57,898
My heart is torn with longing, And in my eyes there's anxiety.

204
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:16,542
- Well, how? - Oh, it doesn't look like it! Oh, hackneyed!

205
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:20,373
Let me at least tie my teeth. My misfortune!

206
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:29,029
- You see, that one has a smarter face! - I'll ask you not to touch his face!

207
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,795
Sit down! Mind your state business. Take the stick. Dictate!

208
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:43,199
- Dictate what? - Well... The Tsar and Grand Duke... repeat.... All Russia...

209
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,049
-Tsar and Grand Duke... repeat, All Russia. - Yes... Don't repeat it! Repeat! Quiet!

210
00:37:52,877 --> 00:37:57,836
So you say... The Tsar and Grand Duke. I did, comma.

211
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:05,929
Where's our secretary gone? What's the matter, comrades?

212
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:12,514
I'm asking you, precious ones, what's the matter?

213
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:21,637
What parasite dared to break down the doors to the tsar's room?

214
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:26,160
Weren't they hung for you to break them?!

215
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:34,460
Go on, Your Majesty! He's beating his head in. Semicolon.

216
00:38:37,509 --> 00:38:40,879
So I'm waiting for an answer to the question I asked.

217
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:44,350
The tsar, the tsar is here, the tsar is here...

218
00:38:47,312 --> 00:38:49,269
The tsar is here!

219
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:54,191
Sit! And where should he be? The Tsar is always in his place!

220
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:59,638
Don't order execution, Great Sovereign, hope! The demons have seized thee.

221
00:38:59,825 --> 00:39:04,986
We've been chasing them all over the chambers! And there are no demons!

222
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:10,010
There were demons. We don't deny it. But they self-destructed.

223
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:14,268
So please stop this silly panic. Who are you?

224
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:20,546
- Theophanes, clerk of the ambassadorial office. - All right, Fedya. Stay here,

225
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,448
and the rest of you, please clear the tsar's office. In short, everybody out.

226
00:39:27,274 --> 00:39:31,436
- Bark at them! - Wo-o-o-n!

227
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:40,844
- Do not execute, Great Sovereign, hope! - Yes, that's enough tumbling!

228
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:43,949
I did it once, I did it twice, that's enough!

229
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:50,460
What's the matter with you, Your Majesty?

230
00:39:50,881 --> 00:39:54,054
Have you got an ailment?

231
00:39:54,844 --> 00:39:58,681
Don't be silent like a stump! I can't work alone!

232
00:39:58,848 --> 00:40:04,934
- My teeth hurt. - He has periostitis, flus. Don't pester the tsar.

233
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:10,941
- Fedya! Stop bowing. You'll be falling down till tonight.

234
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:18,859
- Let's meet! - Don't be angry, Boyar, I don't recognize you. Are you the Prince?

235
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:23,833
Я? I guess I'm a prince! What's so surprising?

236
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:28,589
Where did you come from in the tsar's chamber? You weren't there?

237
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:34,304
- My dear tsar, who is he? - He's a friend of Anton Semyonovich Shpak.

238
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,796
Oh, you fool!

239
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:43,646
The tsar says I'm Prince Miloslavsky. Does that suit you?

240
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:47,442
- Dibs... Get lost! - What is it? It's not good again! What's the matter?

241
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:51,311
- You were executed the other day! - That's news to me!

242
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:58,412
They hanged you at your own gate on the third day by order of the king.

243
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:09,585
Oh, thank you! They hung me on your order. Help me out, or we'll fall asleep.

244
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:16,816
Why don't you say something, you bastard? А? You remembered! It wasn't me who was hanged.

245
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,855
- What was the name of that hanged man? - Vanka the robber.

246
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:26,663
- Yes. And I'm the opposite, Georges. That bandit is just my namesake.

247
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:32,780
- Am I right? - Mm-hmm. - There you go.

248
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:39,718
- What are they yelling about again? Run, Fedya, find out! - Yes, yes!

249
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:44,665
Tsar, Tsar, Tsar...

250
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:50,050
Puck, puck...

251
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:54,746
The men of the service want to see the Tsar saved. They're rejoicing!

252
00:41:54,891 --> 00:42:00,977
No, that's out of the question. There's no time. We'll rejoice later.

253
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:09,902
Send them away immediately, understand? The damned man won't say a word.

254
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:17,510
- Why, Fedenka, there's no war now? - Of course there isn't, fedya!

255
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:22,588
The Swedes are really jamming, the Crimean khan is outrageous on the Izyum road.

256
00:42:22,964 --> 00:42:27,258
- How could you let this happen?! - Don't order an execution!

257
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:35,267
Stand up, Fyodor! I don't blame you. Sit down.

258
00:42:36,437 --> 00:42:39,154
"Write: 'The Tsar's decree. "

259
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:47,047
I order to send an army to dislodge the Crimean Khan from Izyum Road.

260
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:59,790
Sign it, Great Sovereign.

261
00:43:00,0000 --> 00:43:04,165
I have no right to sign such historical documents.

262
00:43:25,324 --> 00:43:30,781
Tell them not to hurry back. Let them take Kazan on the way back.

263
00:43:31,031 --> 00:43:35,244
So they don't have to go twice. - How can it be, father,

264
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:41,671
Kazan is ours. We took it long ago. - Yes? You were in a hurry.

265
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:48,860
- Don't order an execution! - All right, then. Once we've taken it, it's all right. We can't give it back to them.

266
00:43:53,646 --> 00:43:59,934
Well, go! And be out of here in five minutes.

267
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:21,796
In the green springtime Under the old pine tree

268
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:25,510
Vanyusha bids farewell to his beloved.

269
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:29,633
He tinkles with his ring and speaks softly:

270
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:33,139
"Don't cry, don't cry, beautiful Marusya.

271
00:44:33,982 --> 00:44:41,278
Marusya is silent and tears are shed, Her soul is aching with sorrow.

272
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:45,609
Drop, drop, drop From Marusya's clear eyes

273
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,915
Tears drip on the spear

274
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:53,787
Drop, drop, drop From Marusya's clear eyes

275
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:57,861
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip,

276
00:44:58,592 --> 00:45:00,549
Drip, drip, drip, drip.

277
00:45:04,765 --> 00:45:07,683
In cold winter, again under a pine tree.

278
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:11,851
Vanyusha meets his sweetheart.

279
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:15,941
He rings his ring again, and says softly:

280
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:19,571
I've come back to you, my beauty.

281
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:28,195
Marusya sheds tears of happiness, Like a psaltery her soul sings.

282
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:32,308
Drip, drip, drip, From Marusya's clear eyes

283
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:36,289
Tears drip on the spear...

284
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:18,471
Well, let's get on with it. Why isn't the inventor spinning his time machine?

285
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:23,023
- Oh, my God! What a scandal waiting for me at home! - What's the matter?

286
00:46:23,023 --> 00:46:29,029
- I didn't tell Ulyana Andreyevna where I was going! - Oh, yes, of course. - That's just it!

287
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:41,882
Excuse me for disturbing you during your family drama,

288
00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:46,666
tell me, is Ivan Vassilyevich not with you? They're looking for him all over the place.

289
00:47:55,785 --> 00:48:02,868
Oh, what a scoundrel! And why did I open up to this holy man?

290
00:48:06,0006 --> 00:48:08,798
Shurik, are you home?

291
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,455
What's that, huh?

292
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:52,135
Oh, my God! It was me who took that scoundrel Yakin's suitcase.

293
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:01,503
Not only did that hysterical woman make a scene at the studio,

294
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,582
she got our suitcases mixed up. It's an hour before the plane.

295
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,488
Karp Savelyich! I can't believe my luck.

296
00:49:23,298 --> 00:49:26,667
Wait for me and I'll be back.

297
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,839
Hello! Anyuta? You can't imagine! I'm going to Gagra! With Yakin himself!

298
00:49:44,669 --> 00:49:47,990
I think, Zinaida Mikhailovna, you know very well that after what you did at the studio,

299
00:49:47,991 --> 00:49:51,118
what you've done at the studio, it's all over between us!

300
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:56,056
- Karp Savelyevich, you scoundrel! - I'll ask for my suitcase back.

301
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,546
I hope all my things are in one piece.

302
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:07,571
You scoundrel! Scoundrel!

303
00:50:08,514 --> 00:50:12,746
I'm leaving my husband, this holy man with all his comforts.

304
00:50:13,834 --> 00:50:18,224
The ingenious inventor. I'm going to that... scoundrel!

305
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:24,124
- My God, what text, what words! - You don't know the real words yet!

306
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:30,618
And two hours before I leave, I find him with some kikimora,

307
00:50:31,288 --> 00:50:38,704
He grabs her hands and behaves like the last bastard!

308
00:50:39,714 --> 00:50:44,844
I had a scene with her! Hysterical woman. It's my professional duty.

309
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:48,795
Professor de fois! - That's enough! I've had enough.

310
00:50:50,267 --> 00:50:56,462
"I'm leaving you for director Budimir Kosoy's production of Boris Godunov."

311
00:50:57,859 --> 00:51:04,277
- Kosoy is a hack. - And you're talentless! I'll play the tsarina with him.

312
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:10,139
Kosoy has no one for the role of John the Terrible. - What? No John?

313
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:16,402
- I've already rehearsed with him. - Where did you rehearse? - Here!

314
00:51:19,216 --> 00:51:25,025
- Who's playing Boris, the Tsar? Who? - Boris the Tsar who?

315
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:30,891
Boris the Tsar?

316
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,679
What, are you really rehearsing?

317
00:51:34,315 --> 00:51:37,944
So he, the wicked one, paid the wicked one for the pre-tribulation?

318
00:51:38,487 --> 00:51:44,691
He himself wanted to reign and rule everything? He's guilty of death!

319
00:51:45,328 --> 00:51:49,049
My God, what a type! Bravo, bravo!

320
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,415
Please, go on!

321
00:51:54,054 --> 00:51:57,172
Why have you offended the boyarina? Smerd!

322
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:03,878
Wonderful! Amazing! Genius! Look, I don't recognize you in your makeup.

323
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:11,889
Who are you? Sergei Bondarchuk? No. Yuri Nikulin? No, no...

324
00:52:15,986 --> 00:52:21,408
My God, Innokenty Smoktunovsky!

325
00:52:24,328 --> 00:52:26,820
Kesha!

326
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:33,543
- How could you hide this from me? - Oh, you pikey death pimple!

327
00:52:33,922 --> 00:52:38,804
- Are you crazy? - Here, you son of a bitch! - Kesha! That's not witty!

328
00:52:40,721 --> 00:52:42,264
Oh, my God!

329
00:52:42,807 --> 00:52:45,831
Scoundrel, son of a bitch! You wretched adulterer!

330
00:52:46,603 --> 00:52:49,723
That's the real tsar!

331
00:52:50,524 --> 00:52:54,189
Help! Help! Help! Militia!

332
00:52:54,695 --> 00:52:57,400
On your knees, you worm!

333
00:52:57,698 --> 00:53:00,616
I got you, you adulterous son of a bitch, Yakin!

334
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:05,872
Say your prayers, son of a pike! Say goodbye to life.

335
00:53:07,0007 --> 00:53:11,834
- Oh, are you rehearsing, Zinaida Mikhailovna? - Re-pe-pe-pe-ing...

336
00:53:13,013 --> 00:53:19,336
What kind of rehearsal is this?... Call the police. - Where? - I'm here, I'm here.

337
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:25,550
Just like you play! And the tsar is so typical...

338
00:53:27,898 --> 00:53:31,730
He looks like our Bunsha!

339
00:53:31,977 --> 00:53:37,366
And me, Zinaida Mikhailovna, I've been robbed. The dog and the police promised to come!

340
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,573
Who do you belong to?

341
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:43,956
Excuse me, comrade artiste, but what's this - whose?

342
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:48,048
- Whose peasant, I ask? - Excuse me, but I don't understand you!

343
00:53:48,212 --> 00:53:50,881
You stupid peasant!

344
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:57,057
- Why are you always a smerd and a smerd? - It's the role he's playing. Well, that's the role!

345
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,653
It's a scolding role, I beg you not to apply it to me!

346
00:54:02,186 --> 00:54:05,522
What a house - now they steal, now they call me names,

347
00:54:05,856 --> 00:54:11,362
and we're fighting for the honorary title of a house of high culture of life. It's a nightmare!

348
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,316
- Well, you pimple, ask the boyarina for a belly or a death. - Stomach.

349
00:54:18,161 --> 00:54:21,675
- Belly, belly. - Have mercy on him, Your Majesty!

350
00:54:22,374 --> 00:54:29,505
Belly? Have it your way!

351
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:37,764
Hear me out, Karp. Only, I beg you, be calm.

352
00:54:39,226 --> 00:54:42,042
This is the real Ivan the Terrible!

353
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:49,936
Remember what I said about the time machine? Well, Shuriku has had this experience!

354
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:02,647
- He could have stabbed me! - And by the way, he would have done the right thing!

355
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:09,974
Bullshit! Who's John the Terrible? He died a long time ago.

356
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:16,683
- Who died? - I'm not talking about you! It's the other one who died, who...

357
00:55:26,861 --> 00:55:33,033
- Did you seduce the boyarina? - Я. I am. My life.

358
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:40,500
What is your life, you stinking dog! Look at yourself! Vita!

359
00:55:41,794 --> 00:55:45,360
- Tell me something in Slavonic. - Paki...

360
00:55:46,174 --> 00:55:51,679
Paki, Paki... And the cherubim! Your Excellency, have mercy.

361
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:55,802
By the way, you misunderstood me!

362
00:55:56,477 --> 00:55:59,354
How can I understand you if you don't say anything?

363
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:02,166
I don't speak languages, Your Excellency.

364
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,279
- Do you love the boyarina? - I love her! Madly!

365
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:15,493
Oh, boyarina, she's beautiful, she's inky with her lips, and her eyebrows are all alike.

366
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:23,391
- What more do you want, dog? - Nothing. - So wait, bury the dog. The Prince is letting her go.

367
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:27,027
I ask for your hand, Zinaida Mikhailovna!

368
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,641
Hello! Galochka? You're going to die. That's wonderful news! Yakin has abandoned

369
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:38,555
his kikimora, so he persuaded me to fly to Gagra with him.

370
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:43,441
Well, you sinful beard, if I find out anything bad about you!

371
00:56:44,237 --> 00:56:47,108
- Don't interrupt the tsar! - Yes, I will!

372
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:52,052
- I give you a fur coat from the tsar's shoulder! - Thank you! Thank you!

373
00:56:53,252 --> 00:56:57,292
Thank you... I'm very grateful to you!

374
00:56:59,671 --> 00:57:03,539
Your Majesty! You can't stay like this.

375
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,751
There's no telling what they might think.

376
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:14,343
God Almighty! I've forgotten where I am. Lord! I forgot!

377
00:57:15,396 --> 00:57:22,562
- Change your clothes, John Vassilyevich! Oh, the devil's clothes!

378
00:57:24,614 --> 00:57:30,867
My thoughts are confused: a fur coat, Tsar John the Terrible...

379
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:36,376
Stop fidgeting! John the Terrible, what's the big deal?

380
00:57:36,377 --> 00:57:40,040
- You'd better go and help the tsar change his clothes. - Yes, sir!

381
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:45,045
Hello! Vava? You're going to fall!

382
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:56,181
My God! He looks just like our Bunsha!

383
00:57:58,193 --> 00:58:02,772
Not at all! It suits you very well. My dear tsar, we must be going.

384
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:09,819
- Since we're very late for our plane. - Good riddance!

385
00:58:10,748 --> 00:58:16,953
Let me thank you for everything! You're a very temperamental man!

386
00:58:39,822 --> 00:58:44,671
Hello! Shurochka? Imagine, Yakin fell in love with me like a boy,

387
00:58:44,952 --> 00:58:49,801
proposed to me and we're going on a honeymoon.

388
00:58:51,584 --> 00:58:53,661
Touch it!

389
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:04,652
Oh, what a beauty! It's beautiful.

390
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,104
It's soooo good!

391
00:59:18,864 --> 00:59:21,190
A smoke break!

392
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,386
- The Swedish ambassador... - What is it, Fedya?

393
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:36,631
- The Swedish ambassador's been asked to accept!

394
01:00:09,308 --> 01:00:12,836
Bring in the citizen ambassador!

395
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:19,019
Move your eyebrows! Move your eyebrows!

396
01:00:55,803 --> 01:01:01,889
Der großer könig, das swedischen königreich, zande mich.

397
01:01:04,688 --> 01:01:12,103
Seinen trayen diner, zu inen, tsar i feliki kneze

398
01:01:13,865 --> 01:01:19,701
Ivan Vasilievich usarussa.

399
01:01:20,872 --> 01:01:26,389
- Intourist, speaks well! - What does he say exactly? - The devil knows!

400
01:01:28,422 --> 01:01:34,219
- We need an interpreter! - We had an interpreter for him to translate, but he doesn't know a thing.

401
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,184
We boiled him in boiling water. - That's no way to treat interpreters!

402
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:46,639
- Answer something, you see, the man's tiring himself out. - Hitler kaput!

403
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,979
Go on, Mr. Ambassador. We absolutely agree with you!

404
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:56,487
- Kemska volost! - That's right, absolutely...

405
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:06,672
Listen, comrade! Comrade, can I talk to you for a minute?

406
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:11,532
I'd like to understand, so to speak, in general terms, what he needs.

407
01:02:12,012 --> 01:02:16,390
You can understand him, my dear tsar, of course. They want Kemsky parish.

408
01:02:16,391 --> 01:02:21,115
We fought in the war, they say, so bring it here! - What, what? Kemsk parish?

409
01:02:26,402 --> 01:02:31,865
- Let them take it away in good health! I thought, Lord! - How can it be like this, fed?

410
01:02:31,866 --> 01:02:36,992
The tsar knows what he's doing! The state won't be poor! Take it away! Take it away!

411
01:02:37,956 --> 01:02:42,042
Don't execute me, Your Majesty! Speak your word!

412
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:50,135
Are you a son of a bitch, an impostor, squandering the lands of the state?

413
01:02:50,136 --> 01:02:52,555
There won't be enough parishes to go around!

414
01:02:52,556 --> 01:02:56,257
What shall I tell my king?

415
01:02:57,895 --> 01:03:02,399
- Give your king my warmest regards. - And Kemsk parish?

416
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:07,946
Such matters, my dear ambassador, are not resolved from the blink of an eye. We must consult

417
01:03:07,947 --> 01:03:15,244
with our comrades. Come back in a week. By the way, a little souvenir for you from me!

418
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:22,232
Here you are.

419
01:03:28,432 --> 01:03:34,134
Well, auf Wiedersehen! Goodbye! Au revoir! In short, ciao!

420
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,401
Everyone is free.

421
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:52,246
Yes, the convoy is also free. Convoy free!

422
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:08,0008
- Why are you crawling, Father? - The ambassador has lost his knighthood from his chest.

423
01:04:09,681 --> 01:04:15,601
You can't be so absent-minded. You should watch your things when you enter a room.

424
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:22,591
- Why are you staring at me, Fedor? Don't you think I've taken it? - You didn't!

425
01:04:23,023 --> 01:04:25,844
You didn't take it?

426
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:30,617
Or maybe you rolled up behind the throne?

427
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:35,783
Well, no, I didn't. - What a woe!

428
01:04:43,802 --> 01:04:50,684
I'm having second thoughts again, Shpak has the tape recorder, and the ambassador has the medallion.

429
01:04:51,878 --> 01:04:57,400
What are you hinting at? I'm asking you, what are you hinting at, tsar's face?

430
01:04:58,058 --> 01:05:01,478
The Tatar prince Yedigey to the sovereign!

431
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:10,202
The reception is over. Lunchtime.

432
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,745
The king desires to dine!

433
01:05:30,228 --> 01:05:35,984
- This is some kind of dream! - Wait a minute! Who's paying for this banquet? Who's going to pay for it?

434
01:05:36,276 --> 01:05:40,124
Not us, anyway! Fedya, what's in there?

435
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:45,530
Ah, hare's kidneys, pike heads with garlic.

436
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:52,290
Black caviar! Red caviar! Yes... Foreign caviar...

437
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:56,831
Eggplant caviar!

438
01:05:58,217 --> 01:06:04,505
- It's beautiful! Well, tsar, shudder! - Shudder.

439
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:38,038
- It's beautiful! - Hello! I'm looking for him all over the house, and he's sitting in someone else's apartment.

440
01:06:38,038 --> 01:06:42,974
Why are you turning your back on me? - Look how my apartment has been cleaned!

441
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:47,343
It's all that was earned by hard work, it's all ruined!

442
01:06:47,562 --> 01:06:53,162
What do you look like, huh? You've gone crazy from drinking! You're unrecognizable!

443
01:06:53,235 --> 01:06:58,478
- What are you wearing? - An imported tape recorder... - He's drunk!

444
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:01,493
A gold cigarette case, domestically made, there's nothing.

445
01:07:01,494 --> 01:07:04,697
He can't stand on his feet! Where are you going?

446
01:07:05,874 --> 01:07:09,669
What the hell is this? Go home, alcoholic!

447
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:12,308
- Leave me alone, old lady, I'm sad.

448
01:07:13,382 --> 01:07:20,215
Old lady? You're a jerk! I'm 5 years younger than you. Come on, let's go now!

449
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:24,633
- You're a witch! - Guard! Guard!

450
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:36,618
- Ooh, a witch! - Honestly, yes!

451
01:07:38,409 --> 01:07:41,837
- What do you want? - Dear Ivan Vassilyevich,

452
01:07:41,997 --> 01:07:45,499
I ask you to testify. Here's a list of stolen things:

453
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,961
Two tape recorders, two movie cameras, two cigarette cases. Please!

454
01:07:50,188 --> 01:07:56,056
- It's like filing a petition to the tsar! - Allow me! You're not hooliganism!

455
01:07:58,264 --> 01:08:03,223
What kind of drunken tricks are these? I'll file a complaint against you - a collective complaint!

456
01:08:04,0004 --> 01:08:07,805
I can see you, peasant, won't give up!

457
01:08:09,0009 --> 01:08:14,311
A psychiatric hospital? My husband's got delirium!

458
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:17,197
He attacks people with a knife.

459
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:21,778
- Stop, put that knife away! - Knife!

460
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:26,940
Look at our activist! He's an armed bandit!

461
01:08:27,379 --> 01:08:30,898
- A peasant! - I hear from a peasant! - A peasant!

462
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:34,512
Now the police will decide which of us is a peasant!

463
01:08:37,223 --> 01:08:40,977
- I beg you, wait! It's not Bunsha! - What do you mean it's not Bunsha?

464
01:08:40,978 --> 01:08:45,188
It's John the Terrible, the real one!

465
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:59,824
I'm busy, call me later!

466
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:07,204
I told you a secret, you're a decent man. I beg you, promise to keep quiet.

467
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:11,688
- Not at all! I give you my word of honor. - Thank you, thank you.

468
01:09:18,602 --> 01:09:24,142
Militia? That's the talk of today's stolen Spak.

469
01:09:25,025 --> 01:09:28,320
I'm not talking about the theft. We've got a cleaner case here.

470
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:32,271
Engineer Timofeyev summoned a living tsar to his apartment.

471
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:39,364
I'm not a drinker. With a dagger. A cold weapon. You have my word of honor. Waiting.

472
01:09:50,971 --> 01:09:55,181
- I can imagine what a fight is going on at Izyumskiy Shlyah right now! - That's all right!

473
01:09:55,184 --> 01:09:59,772
Fedya, why are you huddling by the kidneys? Come here, don't be shy.

474
01:10:00,106 --> 01:10:04,982
Here. Let's have a drink.

475
01:10:05,763 --> 01:10:10,648
Listen, old man, do you take jewelry at your jewelry store?

476
01:10:12,536 --> 01:10:15,537
- You got it! - Shudder.

477
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:20,992
The tsarina is here to see you, Your Majesty! She wants to see!

478
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:27,795
You shouldn't have taken it off! You don't have a tsar's face.

479
01:10:28,345 --> 01:10:32,722
What? But I'll ask you! Who are you talking to? You lackey!

480
01:10:38,606 --> 01:10:42,556
Dear Tsarina, I'm very glad to meet you! Very glad to meet you.

481
01:10:45,113 --> 01:10:48,930
Very glad to meet you. Hello. Tsar... Pleased to meet you, Tsar.

482
01:10:49,542 --> 01:10:55,055
Pleased to meet you. The tsar, the tsar, how do you do? Hello, tsar, how do you do?

483
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:59,586
Please, please come to our table.

484
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,639
- I think we've met somewhere. - What are you talking about, you bastard?

485
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:13,507
A human being! Waiter! Kidneys once to the tsarina.

486
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,862
- Excuse me, your name and patronymic? - I'm Marfa Vasilyevna. - Wonderful!

487
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,855
Charming! Marfa Vasilyevna!

488
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:34,617
- A shot of cardamom? - Oh, not at all! - Why, don't refuse. Bless you.

489
01:11:39,506 --> 01:11:47,047
You say you're a tsar, a tsar. And you think it's easy for us tsars? Not at all!

490
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:53,266
All workers have two days off, we tsars work without days off.

491
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,428
Our working day is irregular.

492
01:11:57,233 --> 01:12:01,481
Have a bite, Margarita Vasilyevna, it's all paid for.

493
01:12:02,656 --> 01:12:08,0008
If you want to know, we tsars should be given milk for free!

494
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:14,554
"Health magazine says so directly: nerve cells are not restored."

495
01:12:14,711 --> 01:12:19,019
And yet you work hard, great lord, like a bee!

496
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:25,346
Margo, you're the only person who understands me.

497
01:12:27,027 --> 01:12:31,180
- Another drink with a pike head? - Oh, no, no, no, no!

498
01:12:34,231 --> 01:12:40,040
- Tell me, don't you have a separate office? - You, your nobility, you've had your fill!

499
01:12:40,363 --> 01:12:44,763
Why don't you maestros say something? Come on, give us something!

500
01:12:48,048 --> 01:12:54,576
It's not a big cloud that's drowned out. A cloud!

501
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:05,882
It wasn't the big thunders that rumbled.

502
01:13:07,852 --> 01:13:10,336
Thunder!

503
01:13:11,314 --> 01:13:16,938
Where's the Crimean Khan going, dog?

504
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,862
Dog!

505
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,665
What dog is that?

506
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:37,171
I won't let you sing such songs about the tsar! You've gone wild here without me.

507
01:13:37,843 --> 01:13:40,040
What's your repertoire?

508
01:13:40,262 --> 01:13:46,182
We should sing something massively modern. How's that? Tilly, tilly, tilly, tilly,

509
01:13:46,644 --> 01:13:51,223
Tili-tili. We're not tili-tili, we're not tili-tili.

510
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,055
Calm down, Vanya! It'll be done.

511
01:13:55,404 --> 01:14:00,909
- Excuse me, what's your patronymic? - Marfa Vasilyevna. - Well, Marfa.

512
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:05,578
Eh, Marfusha, should we be in sorrow?

513
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:10,952
- You, Father, just tell us how it is, and we'll take it. - Stop! Quiet.

514
01:14:11,011 --> 01:14:17,017
Suddenly, in silence,

515
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:22,681
Knocks at the door.

516
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:29,606
You've come to me, haven't you? I do and I don't.

517
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:37,037
The snow was falling, the dawn was breaking, Autumn was drizzling.

518
01:14:38,038 --> 01:14:46,208
So many years, so many years, Where have you been?

519
01:14:48,962 --> 01:14:56,683
Suddenly, like in a fairy tale, the door creaked, All is now clear to me.

520
01:14:57,388 --> 01:15:02,893
So many years I fought with fate For the sake of this meeting with you.

521
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:08,166
I've been freezing somewhere, sailing across the sea. I know it wasn't for nothing.

522
01:15:08,943 --> 01:15:13,735
Everything in the world was not in vain. It was not in vain.

523
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:20,539
You've come, you've come true And don't wait for an answer.

524
01:15:21,164 --> 01:15:26,586
How could I live without you in this world?

525
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:32,339
He who waits Will bear it all, No matter how hard life beats him.

526
01:15:33,218 --> 01:15:39,590
Just as long as it's not all in vain.

527
01:15:40,352 --> 01:15:41,811
Everybody dance!

528
01:17:24,024 --> 01:17:29,464
The army is in revolt! They say the king is not real!

529
01:17:39,941 --> 01:17:46,046
- Dear Autocrat, we are lost! - I demand a continuation of the banquet!

530
01:17:48,992 --> 01:17:52,575
Missing how? Why?

531
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:29,692
Here!

532
01:18:33,165 --> 01:18:39,536
- Hurry, Prince, bring me back! - In three minutes it will be ready!

533
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:06,567
Right away, Ivan Vassilyevich. In the meantime, you'd better change into your czar's clothes.

534
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,900
Do you smoke? Don't smoke? You're doing the right thing.

535
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:39,730
I don't smoke either. Who are you, anyway?

536
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:44,450
- I am the king. - A nickname! - Quiet. Surname?

537
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:52,886
- We are Rurikovich. - Name, patronymic? - Ioann Vasilievich. - John.

538
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:59,882
- Year of birth? - 1533 A.D.

539
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:06,631
- We're joking. - So much for Tarapunka and the plug. - Quiet. Where do you live?

540
01:20:08,0008 --> 01:20:11,519
- In the wards! - What wards?

541
01:20:11,815 --> 01:20:13,523
Your address, your address!

542
01:20:13,859 --> 01:20:18,821
- Tell me, what's my fault, boyar? - The wolf of Tambov is your boyar!

543
01:20:18,822 --> 01:20:22,156
- Did you take Shpak's apartment? - Shpak's? - Yes!

544
01:20:23,023 --> 01:20:28,867
I took Kazan, I took Astrakhan, I took Revel, but I didn't take Shpak.

545
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:33,033
Here he is! We've got you, my dove! You've waited, drunkard?

546
01:20:33,533 --> 01:20:36,924
- Who are you? - Comrade Lieutenant, I'm that alcoholic's wife.

547
01:20:36,926 --> 01:20:40,509
Liar! You're not my wife, old woman!

548
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:46,471
He's drunk out of his mind. He doesn't recognize his wife. We had to call a psychiatrist.

549
01:20:47,562 --> 01:20:53,981
That's it! I see he's talking nonsense. He took Kazan, he took Astrakhan.

550
01:20:54,945 --> 01:20:59,824
- He calls himself Tsar - Ivan the Terrible. - White fever. A typical case.

551
01:20:59,826 --> 01:21:04,737
- What's the patient's real name? - Bunsha Ivan Vasilyevich.

552
01:21:04,998 --> 01:21:09,126
- Liar! You witch! - I can't see him!

553
01:21:10,587 --> 01:21:15,333
Attention! Get ready, Ivan Vassilyevich!

554
01:21:24,102 --> 01:21:27,637
Take the impostors alive!

555
01:21:37,408 --> 01:21:40,160
Black caviar!

556
01:21:41,321 --> 01:21:44,044
Red caviar!

557
01:21:45,045 --> 01:21:48,453
Caviar from overseas, eggplant caviar!

558
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:44,169
Comrade Timofeev! Alexander Sergeyevich! Save me! Save me! Save me!

559
01:22:44,481 --> 01:22:48,048
Ivan Vasilyevich, hurry! Farewell!

560
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:06,201
- Alive? - Alive! No one will believe it if I tell them! - The police will believe it!

561
01:23:12,929 --> 01:23:17,390
Your Majesty! Just a moment!

562
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:30,447
Interesting movie! Why do you have, comrade scientist, police on duty at the site?

563
01:23:30,448 --> 01:23:36,238
- Oh, it's your friend, Shpak, who was robbed today. - What are you saying?!

564
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:45,957
- Another one was detained, Comrade Lieutenant. - No, they didn't. I came to you myself.

565
01:23:47,759 --> 01:23:52,796
I want to confess to you wholeheartedly. I'm delighted to surrender to the police.

566
01:23:54,808 --> 01:23:58,984
- Who are you? - Ivan Vassilyevich Bunsha.

567
01:24:00,147 --> 01:24:03,817
- So you claim to be Ivan Vassilyevich Bunsha? - Well...

568
01:24:03,818 --> 01:24:07,863
- Your papers! - I left them at home.

569
01:24:08,378 --> 01:24:14,569
- And who can confirm your identity? - Anybody! At least ask my wife.

570
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:22,929
Did you want to confess something?

571
01:24:25,025 --> 01:24:28,427
I confess that not of my own free will, but under the compulsion of Prince Miloslavsky,

572
01:24:28,428 --> 01:24:33,590
I was temporarily acting tsar. - What tsar? And you're the tsar?

573
01:24:33,642 --> 01:24:40,773
- The Tsar, Ivan Vassilyevich the Terrible. - You lie, you dog! I am the Tsar!

574
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:51,781
Everything I've gained by hard work is gone: three tape recorders, three movie cameras,

575
01:24:53,497 --> 01:24:58,623
three cigarette cases, a suede jacket - three jackets.

576
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:06,0006
And they're still fighting for the honorary title of home of high culture of life!

577
01:25:09,723 --> 01:25:14,267
Tell me again, who is he?

578
01:25:14,812 --> 01:25:19,526
- My God, I told you, my husband is Ivan Vassilyevich Bunsha.

579
01:25:19,567 --> 01:25:24,609
Now you'll be cured, alcoholic. - Wonderful! And who's he?

580
01:25:28,285 --> 01:25:32,235
- An impostor! - An impostor, that's what I hear!

581
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:40,749
- Well, who's he? - My husband, Ivan Vassilyevich Bunsha. And you'll be cured!

582
01:25:44,553 --> 01:25:50,923
- So you have two husbands? - That's right, two husbands. - And both are Bunshas?

583
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:56,517
Both!

584
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:06,149
And you will be cured! They'll cure you, too!

585
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:12,012
And I will be cured!

586
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:17,474
What you told me is grandiose! As an eyewitness, you're priceless!

587
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:22,135
If I were you, I'd start my doctoral dissertation right away.

588
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:25,469
There's no hurry. I'll always have time to sit down.

589
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:40,111
Are you coming to me? I do and I don't. The snow was falling...

590
01:26:40,864 --> 01:26:45,452
Ulyana Andreyevna, I was a tsarina, but I didn't betray you! I was tempted by the tsarina,

591
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:48,370
but I didn't give in. I swear it!

592
01:26:53,118 --> 01:26:56,819
- Damn it! Miloslavsky himself was in our hands!

593
01:26:57,216 --> 01:27:01,593
- Georges Miloslavsky? - Nada! Stop him! Quickly! - Now!

594
01:27:03,389 --> 01:27:08,514
Stop! Hold Miloslavsky! Hold him!

595
01:27:43,683 --> 01:27:47,301
I was pretty sure I sent you back.

596
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:52,745
- Hurry up, Prince, spin your car. - Where have you been all this time?

597
01:27:52,985 --> 01:27:55,227
The militia got you. They're making a case!

598
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:05,936
The chase, Prince! The chase. Hurry! Hurry, hurry, God!

599
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:10,010
Run, Ivan Vassilyevich! Run!

600
01:28:12,548 --> 01:28:17,424
- Hurry, Ivan Vassilyevich! - Run, Lord, my grave sins!

601
01:28:23,435 --> 01:28:28,117
- Farewell, Prince! - Farewell! Don't say goodbye, Ivan Vassilyevich.

602
01:28:56,429 --> 01:28:59,890
- It's an outrage! - You've blacked out the whole house again, you know!

603
01:28:59,891 --> 01:29:03,269
Mind you, we'll complain about you to the proper authorities!

604
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:06,523
What, they let you out of the asylum already?

605
01:29:06,857 --> 01:29:11,569
- What? What is it? Oh, you hooligan! - What rudeness! And you're wearing glasses!

606
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:15,818
You'll be tried, you bastard!

607
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:32,756
What was it, was I imagining things or was it really happening?

608
01:29:34,929 --> 01:29:41,134
Ivan the Terrible? Miloslavsky? Ah, because Zina left me!

609
01:29:49,341 --> 01:29:53,312
Delirium, that hit me hard!

610
01:29:55,911 --> 01:29:57,903
What if I'm not delirious?

611
01:29:58,736 --> 01:30:05,913
Oh, my God! What's going on with you? I got high, I got high. And, of course, I haven't had lunch yet.

612
01:30:16,391 --> 01:30:21,979
- You didn't go to Gagra? - What Gagra? You're going crazy with your car.

613
01:30:28,237 --> 01:30:32,283
Oh, where did you plant such a lump?

614
01:30:37,164 --> 01:30:42,515
- Zina, tell me honestly, where were you just now? - At the rehearsal. - All right.

615
01:30:44,297 --> 01:30:48,778
I'll ask you straight out: "Do you love Yakin?"

616
01:30:50,865 --> 01:30:56,529
- What Yakin? What's wrong with you, Shurik? - Don't pretend! He's your film director!

617
01:30:57,519 --> 01:31:04,270
- We don't have any Yakin as a director. - Really? - Honestly.
