1
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:36,376
In the glorious city of Rostov, a cathedral priest in Rostov had one son.

2
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:41,120
His name was Alyosha, his father's name was Popovich.

3
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:57,463
Aliosha grew by leaps and bounds.

4
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:06,753
Aliosha was learning to read, but nothing came out of it.

5
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,850
And then he began to learn the warrior's trade.

6
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,946
-Muuuu!!! -Aya-ya-ya!!!

7
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,999
-That's what your Alyoshenka did! ! There!

8
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:41,748
-Hehehehe...

9
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:48,661
-Ouch!

10
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:53,491
-That's what your boy Alyosha did!...

11
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:39,450
And in those bad times, the Tugarian armies started trampling on the Russian land, and

12
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:42,057
the Russian people.

13
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:48,204
A black force came to collect a considerable tribute from the people of Rostov.

14
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:52,071
-But... what shall we do, Russians?

15
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:06,436
-Listen to me, Alyosha, son of a cathedral priest, how long will the Russians

16
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:12,610
How long will we Russians endure this evil foe? Let's protect our wives and children and stand up for our Russian land!

17
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,874
-The point is... -If you have something concrete to propose, then...

18
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:22,629
but if you're just talking, get off the barrel! Don't mess with people's heads.

19
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,096
-Quiet, my dear friend... bring our idea on paper, we'll put it to people's judgment.

20
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,446
-Vo!!! -We'll take the Tugarians' armies by stealth.

21
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:42,232
We'll collect their tribute in gold, we'll put that tribute in a cave under Bayun Mountain, and as soon as the Tugarian army

22
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:50,105
the Tugarian army enters it, we'll cover our trap with a stone! Hee-hee-hee-hee!!!

23
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,671
-And you, how will we get the gold back from the cave?

24
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:59,901
-Gold? That's... Here... -Let's wait until the Basurmans starve to death...

25
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,635
starve to death... -Oh!

26
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:06,764
Or weaken!

27
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:11,466
It's settled then.

28
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:16,976
-Thank you, Lord, that you've sent Alyosha a plan for our salvation!

29
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:24,168
And the people of Rostov began to collect a golden tribute. Whoever had gold and jewels,

30
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:28,385
they took it all away.

31
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:33,293
-At-two, at-two.

32
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:44,582
-Hooray!!!

33
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,457
-O-o-o-o! That's where we need to go.

34
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,756
-The tribe of the Basurman has complained!

35
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,780
-The black yoke... It won't be long before they feast! Now they're going to have to try their mighty strength!

36
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:51,083
-Come on.

37
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:10,962
-Yeah, have you tasted the might of a bogatyr?

38
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:41,621
-Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

39
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:49,116
-I don't get it... -Is that the plan?

40
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,553
-To stake them! -Huh? -А?

41
00:07:56,653 --> 00:08:00,474
-When I look at our people, I wonder where they get so much hatred.

42
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:03,350
Is it because they're hungry, or are they soulless?

43
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,103
-It's the gold they're so upset about, I'm telling you.

44
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:09,830
-Yes, gold spoils people.

45
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:15,114
-So, Tikhon, as long as I don't get my gold and my good name back.

46
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:18,900
there's nothing for me to do in town. Goodbye, Tikhon.

47
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:24,948
-How can I let you go alone, Alyosha? My father will take my head off!

48
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,687
-You, Tikhon, go home and explain everything to your father and mother.

49
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,240
There's no one but me to defeat Tugarin the serpent.

50
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:39,237
-Wait... my God... how, without weapons, without money, and without comrades?!... You!

51
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:56,316
-We can't let him go alone, he'll get lost on his own.

52
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:02,208
-Where are you, our son? And Tikhon disappeared. He must have run off to help him.

53
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:08,014
-If they come back, I'll skin them both... -Wait, how do we get back as heroes?

54
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:11,961
-I won't let them get away with it. -Oh... -Oh, they came up with a plan...

55
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:18,207
-What a naughty man!.. With his bare hands, he will beat Tugarin alone!

56
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:21,018
Well, nothing, nothing, I'll intercept him behind the forest.

57
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:27,576
-And I have all sorts of dreams... Here's the girl's dream - Alyoshenka has returned,

58
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:31,703
and quietly, like a mouse into the upper room.

59
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:37,165
-Do you hear? Isn't Alyosha coming home?

60
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:41,794
-Will you hear Alyosha rustling like that?! A bird is probably nesting on the roof.

61
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,504
-Alyosha!... -You think it's the wind rustling.

62
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,887
-Are you going far, little berry?

63
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:54,293
-I can't go on like this, my heart is breaking.

64
00:09:54,573 --> 00:10:00,352
-You don't give a damn about that fool, what's going to happen to him? And if he does, it's not a great loss.

65
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:05,400
I won't let him go anywhere! -Oh, yeah?! Then I'll cut off my braids and go to a monastery...

66
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:08,991
and go to a monastery. A man's. -What are you thinking? What are you thinking?

67
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:16,407
They argued as much as they could, but Lyubava insisted on her position. To tell the truth, her grandmother

68
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,685
her grandmother wouldn't let her go. She went with her.

69
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,236
-Bogatyr, buy a horse. Buy it, you won't regret it. A bogatyr horse.

70
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:09,596
-Oh, you black power, you smell your swift doom! Tremble the tribe of the Bussurman

71
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:12,577
before the Russian bogatyr!

72
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:18,558
-Ai da nada nai nai! Ai da nada nai nai! -Hurry up, you nag!

73
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:31,041
-I can't go on... I need to catch my breath.

74
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:39,830
-You, fierce fiend, try some of my bogatyr strength...

75
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:46,260
-Tikhon? Why are you here?

76
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:52,429
-You do as you like, Alyosha, but I'll go with you. The road will be easier for both of us.

77
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:57,956
-Forgive me, I didn't recognize you right away.

78
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:05,606
Why are you dressed like that? -I thought, how can a warrior without a horse, so I bought one.

79
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:11,345
-Why is his face tied up? -His muzzle? I don't know, he must be biting. Bastard.

80
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:24,935
-Yee-gee-gee-gee-gee, freedom... Finally! I almost forgot my native tongue. What are you looking at?

81
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:29,195
-Aah! A talking horse! -It's the demon inside him!

82
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:34,185
-Again... Why do you always react like that? Why are you getting so excited? Take it easy,

83
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:38,609
Take a deep breath... That's good.

84
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,402
Eh-uh-uh, that's too much! -You demon... !

85
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:52,885
-How's it going?! Hang in there!

86
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,627
-Do you hear that? -Doesn't our people get beaten up? -Do you hear that?

87
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:07,532
-What should we do? -We have to run for help!

88
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:13,172
-Wait, a girl can't get into a man's fight, they'll kill her without even noticing!

89
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:17,889
-What do you mean? -How do we... We'll hide first, and when we need help...

90
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:20,585
we'll be right here.

91
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:28,513
-Uh, excuse me...

92
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:34,559
Let's talk about this calmly. Yeah, I'm a talking horse, but that's no reason to fight.

93
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:38,451
-Don't listen to him. Chop his head off. -What are you doing, cutting off his head? My head...

94
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:41,074
...is worth 100 times more than yours. -Why is it worth more? -Why is it worth more?

95
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:44,018
-Can't you even read? -Imagine that.

96
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:47,324
-Don't be ridiculous. How many books have you read in your life?

97
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:52,045
-Okay, that's enough. Where did you come from? -He bought me from a gypsy. He also...

98
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,574
He also gave me a new shirt and boots. -Who, me?

99
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:58,520
-Who, me? And he also gave the gypsies his sword.

100
00:13:58,444 --> 00:14:04,097
-Oh, really? -Well, yes, actually. I-I thought you could use

101
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:08,548
a bogatyr horse would come in handy. -Yeah, it's gonna be tough without a sword. And what's the name

102
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:15,256
of this bogatyr steed? -My name is Gaius Julius Caesar.

103
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:18,619
your education, you may call me Julius.

104
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:23,002
-What kind of a strange name is that? -I was named in honor of the great Roman

105
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:27,202
and emperor. Before the gypsies stole me away, I was at the temple in Novgorod.

106
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:33,028
A lot of interesting books are kept there. -So now the three of us will have to

107
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:40,730
the way is not an easy one... Well, serve me faithfully, bogatyr horse. Leave me neither

108
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:46,352
dead, nor wounded, nor gray wolves to tear, nor black crows to maul,

109
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,862
to my enemies to desecrate. Wherever we are, bring me home.

110
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,882
-There's something in the bushes. -Tikhon, come and see.

111
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:11,439
-Why me? -You go. -Because you're the oldest, most experienced one here,

112
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:15,249
You've done your time... -You want to go, you go.

113
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:22,677
-Who's hiding in the bushes? Show yourself and take up the challenge of a fair fight...

114
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,482
...and taste the strength of a bogatyr... -We'll throw a spear.

115
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:29,057
-Don't throw a spear!

116
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:35,217
-Lyubava? What are you doing here? -Grandma and I have been following you all the way from Rostov.

117
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:40,258
Forgive us, Alyoshenka. My heart was so worried. I couldn't help it.

118
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:47,048
-Yes, what are we going to do now? I guess we'll have to take you brothers with us. We must hurry further,

119
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:53,627
Otherwise we won't find Tugarin or the gold. Meet Julius, my horse.

120
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:58,082
-The Bogatyr's! Ah!

121
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:02,482
-What are you staring at? Haven't you ever seen a talking horse?

122
00:16:04,784 --> 00:16:08,459
-And this is Lyubava... Her grandmother. -And this is Moses, my donkey.

123
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:11,854
-Yeah, really? I thought it was an Arabian horse.

124
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:17,291
-Shut up, Julius. -You shut up.

125
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:23,886
-And where shall we go, Alyosha? -To the place where the unclean are buried. That's where we have to go.

126
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:45,851
-Look, isn't there another way? And anyway, why do we have to go there...? А?.. А?.. А?

127
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:58,852
And they decided to continue the dangerous path together. All hardships and hardships to be shared equally.

128
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:11,886
-What about it, Tikhon, why don't we sing a song to cheer you up? Let's do our bogatyr song...

129
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:25,120
-Oh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh... -Ah-ah-ah... -Ah-ah-ah...

130
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:30,864
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys. I'm already in no mood, but a song like this will make you hang!

131
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:35,093
-What didn't you like about the song? -What song? -It's not a song! Give me a tear. Don't make me laugh

132
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:41,162
...my horseshoes. They don't sing that nowadays. Here, catch the rhythm... And one, one, one, two, three...

133
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:48,199
# There's tibidam tibidam tam-tam-tam-tam There's tibidam tibidam tam-pam...

134
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:08,867
-Dili-dili-dili-dili-dai-yam. Dili-dili-dili-dili-dili dai-om...

135
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:21,127
-They're all yellin'... They left the city penniless, and no matter what, they sing songs...

136
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:24,109
Come on, broads, it's a good song!

137
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,314
-Ugh!

138
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:50,427
-That's it. There's no bridge, we can't get to the other side.

139
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:55,370
-Wait, where? There's no way back. -Come on, I'll show you.

140
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,145
-Stop, you son of a bitch! I told you. -Who do you think you are? You're not the one the bogatyr

141
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,040
is talking to you... -Where did you get such a smart guy?!

142
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,767
-What's there to argue about? Let's figure out how to get to the other side.

143
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,515
-Here's my suggestion...

144
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,650
Here's a simple mechanism... We'll need some trees...

145
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:15,931
We do the math... Gravity, acceleration...

146
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,011
That's it.

147
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:25,596
Well, you could do that.

148
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:31,680
Is it safe?

149
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:37,762
-Safe. -Nat, it's just that you and I have to save ourselves

150
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,599
...or it'd be stupid to die like this.

151
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:44,872
-So, what do you suggest? -So let someone older go first,

152
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:47,380
someone with more experience...

153
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:52,943
-What? -I'm just looking out for the company's success.

154
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:05,752
-Aah!!! -Ga-ga-ga-ga!!!

155
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:15,493
-Where are you, come here...

156
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:23,921
-Wait, why does everybody think only of themselves? -What's wrong, you son of a bitch?

157
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:27,852
-Nothing for me, but what about Moses? -What's Moses got to do with it?

158
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:31,575
-You people are interesting. How can he walk on a log? He's a donkey.

159
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,217
-I'm afraid to walk on a log, too.

160
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:39,824
-Ugh!

161
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:51,786
-Yes! -Bab...

162
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,412
-Yes, what a woman!

163
00:20:54,361 --> 00:21:00,265
Listen, Tikhon, look closely, why? You'll be like a stone wall! And in general, on the household.

164
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,692
-Thank you, Alyoshenka.

165
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,640
-So, Tikhon, you go now. Tikhon... Tikhon

166
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,215
-I'm afraid of heights.

167
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,843
-What are you doing up there? Hurry up! -Now, Tikhon is afraid of heights.

168
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:22,982
-And when you go, don't look down. -I can't not look down.

169
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:26,769
-Oh, I know what to do... Close your eyes. -That's right.

170
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:31,243
-Courage, go... -Courage... -You go... -Courage...

171
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,766
-Come on, come on, Tikhon. -You can do it.

172
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:48,110
-Silence all of you, one of you has to be in command.

173
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,259
Come on, come on, Tikhon, you can do it, be brave...

174
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,142
-You!!!

175
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:57,725
-Calm down Tikhon, they'll save you now.

176
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:01,805
-Ah-ah-ah-ah!!! -Tikhon...

177
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:07,546
-Why are you looking at me? Is anyone going to save him?

178
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:12,559
-Tikhon! -Alyoshenka!!!

179
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:16,118
-Brrr-rr!

180
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:21,431
-There's nothing to save me... I won't drown.

181
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,313
-There you go, and it's all Julius, Julius!

182
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,269
-That's where we're going. We need to find out the way from the good people.

183
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:44,468
-What if they're not kind, but quite the opposite?

184
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:48,504
-What's the point of guessing? -We need to find out. -That's right... -We need someone

185
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:51,060
...to go and do some recon...

186
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:57,235
-Maybe you'll do it yourself. -Okay, but what's the logic here?

187
00:22:57,151 --> 00:23:02,521
-What logic? -What logic? -Well, darkness, everything is very simple... Alyosha the hero

188
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:08,236
He's the main hero and can't die, I'm his bogatyr horse, Lyubava is the hero's bride, they

189
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,434
they must get married and all that... I won't give Moses away, because I like him, so it's

190
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,174
so it's either you or the grandmother.

191
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:26,247
-You idiot. -You son of a bitch. Take it easy, why are you getting so worked up? All right, let Lyubava go.

192
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,046
-Where's Alyosha?

193
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:39,783
-Go back, or else... Go back, I'm telling you! -You're such a fool!

194
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:52,718
-Hey, come here, there's nobody here.

195
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:06,145
-Uncle, is this the house, if it isn't Svyatogor himself?

196
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:12,831
-Yes, that's right! His house. A glorious bogatyr was!

197
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:16,949
-I wonder if there's anything chewy here?

198
00:24:16,895 --> 00:24:21,115
What is it? Nothing. -You just want something to eat.

199
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:23,778
-Don't look in my mouth! -You don't tell me what to do. Understand?

200
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:28,686
-Don't take me at my word. Got it? -Come on. Let's get some rest and hit the road.

201
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:41,390
-How could you do that?! А? -You're not hurt, Alyosha?

202
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:11,040
-I read in a book that fasting is considered therapeutic only after a good dinner.

203
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,305
Lack of food in the young body contributes to the premature death

204
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,381
of the brain cells, if any.

205
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,948
I feel as if no one could hear me. Of course, I'm just a horse.

206
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:30,206
-Okay, what do you suggest? -Oh, my God, who am I surrounded by?

207
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:34,945
You're a bogeyman, after all... Take your bow, go into the woods and kill someone.  Moses!

208
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,830
-А?!!! -Moses gathers wood, you build a fire...

209
00:25:37,758 --> 00:25:40,374
Lubava and Granny will cook.

210
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,054
-I wonder what you'll be doing the whole time?

211
00:25:42,998 --> 00:25:47,014
-Yes, that's it! -You're ridiculous, I'm a bogatyr horse... What if

212
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:50,590
...tomorrow's battle and I'm tired...

213
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:11,947
-Svyatogor! -Who are you? What do you want?

214
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:15,291
-Forgive us, glorious bogatyr, for our impudence.

215
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:19,231
We dropped in by chance, we're from Rostov ourselves.

216
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:23,634
We're looking for the Tugarian army. They insulted us...

217
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:31,055
-Ooh. Tugarin again... -Listen, would you take up sports or something? No, really?

218
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:37,992
-Well, I'll help you with whatever I can, as they say. -Here you go, Tugarin! We're going to take him and the two

219
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:41,611
...with two bogatyrs... -What two bogatyrs?

220
00:26:41,523 --> 00:26:47,132
-That's our hero from Rostov, Alyosha Popovich.

221
00:26:47,713 --> 00:26:54,914
-Yeah... Is he dumb or what? -I am, that's... Let's punish Tugarin now

222
00:26:54,752 --> 00:27:00,099
...for the sneaky one, that he's near our... city... ...for taking our city's gold.

223
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:19,776
-Yes, Tugarin the serpent has gotten out of hand. Not like before, as I remember now... Back then...

224
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,435
I was in charge of a squad or not, I think it was a squadron...

225
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,717
We gave the Tugars a hard time back then...

226
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:34,145
Well, now you see, I'm old and weak. -Old? Yes, weak!

227
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,479
-Wait a minute, Tugarin... the gold, I've seen them...

228
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:40,667
-Really? Where?

229
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:47,569
-I'll remember now...  Well... I was standing near the forest, and the Tugar band, just

230
00:27:47,408 --> 00:27:50,150
...passing by with the gold.

231
00:27:53,198 --> 00:27:54,994
-I fell asleep. -Yeah, well?

232
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:59,906
-No, look at this. Well? О. Yeah. He's definitely asleep. Hey, big guy!

233
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:02,415
-What? Where? -I can't see from the village.

234
00:28:02,357 --> 00:28:06,474
-Quiet, quiet, what happened? -What happened? Who are you?

235
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:11,018
-I'm Saint Luke, and this is the prophet Moses... -Julius, stop it! You told us about Tugar...

236
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:18,756
...you told us about Tugar, remember? About the gold. -Oh, yes. There was gold. I don't remember which year,

237
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:24,241
but we were coming back from the campaign and the prince rewarded us with gold gold pieces... -Ah...

238
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:26,767
I still have them!

239
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:32,273
-There!

240
00:28:34,294 --> 00:28:39,163
-Ah. That's the wrong gold... Oh, trouble!

241
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:46,069
How can we find Tugarin? -Tugarin, I'll help you. I saw his army

242
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:50,286
I recently saw his army near the edge of the forest. I also know a shortcut.

243
00:28:50,183 --> 00:28:55,723
And to make it easier for you, here, hold this sword.

244
00:28:55,593 --> 00:29:00,291
I don't have the strength in my hands, but it will be just right for you.

245
00:29:12,741 --> 00:29:15,551
-O-o-o-o-o! -Hm.

246
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:30,652
-And-a-and-a-and-a!!! -Thank you, Svyatogor, for your gift.

247
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,000
-Thank you, Russian bogatyr.

248
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:40,841
Show us the way to Tugarin, do us a favor!

249
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:49,497
-Well, Godspeed. You'll go to this bright star as far as the lonely rock, you'll go around it and along the trail up the

250
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:53,736
and go up the mountain, then you'll come out to the cave...

251
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:27,610
And the heroes went on the way that the glorious warrior Svyatogor indicated.

252
00:30:57,363 --> 00:31:00,878
-There's the cave.

253
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,059
Why don't we hold hands just in case?

254
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,955
-Hu...

255
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:26,107
-Aah!!!

256
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,138
-Oops. -It's not that high.

257
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:46,416
-AH... -AH... -Aah!

258
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:58,952
-We're going that way... Let's hold hands...

259
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:01,971
-Maybe we shouldn't, Alyosha? -Why not?

260
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:06,691
-I'm afraid of the dark!

261
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:10,870
-Yulia, I'm crying.

262
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:22,585
Ya!!!

263
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:25,984
-Wow, this must have been where the Gorynych the Serpent used to live.

264
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:31,138
-Come on, b...librarians. -It's kind of cold in here.

265
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:37,830
-That's right... Grave... -Oh, look, I told you the Tugars

266
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:42,916
are out there somewhere... And their arrow. -That's quite an arrow. ! That's a whole spear!

267
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:48,359
Oh... I don't feel good. Am I going back or not... let's all go back.

268
00:32:48,244 --> 00:32:50,951
-Have patience, Julius, have patience.

269
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:56,599
-Don't you think the cave is getting narrower? -It is.

270
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,644
-I should warn you, I'm claustrophobic.

271
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:06,543
-What? -It's a fear of enclosed spaces.

272
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:09,599
-Come on, Julius. -There's no reason to panic.

273
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:14,913
-Panic? Who said anything about panic? It's just to be on the safe side.

274
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:27,821
-Well, let's move. What are you standing up for? -I can't move, I'm pinned down by a rock.

275
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:38,140
-Oh, it looks like it's stuck. -I don't understand. -Wait a minute, are you telling me..,

276
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,039
I could spend the rest of my life in this dark, dank cave?

277
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,989
Okay, now I'll show you what real panic is!

278
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,436
-No need, we're going to try to get you out.

279
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:54,079
-Help me... -Help me... Somebody save the bogatyr horse!!! I don't want to die!

280
00:33:54,379 --> 00:34:00,726
Moses, my friend, take care of my family. -You don't have any family, Julius. -You don't have any family.

281
00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:05,561
-Oh my God! I don't even have a family... I'm still so young.

282
00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:10,765
-Aah!

283
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:21,141
-You should eat less, that's what. -God, how..., how low it is to point out

284
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:23,778
to point out a man's shortcomings in a critical situation.

285
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:26,879
-Silence! Do you hear that?

286
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:30,151
YOU CAN HEAR THE MURMUR OF VOICES.

287
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:40,961
-Tugarin, that's right Tugarin. Their dialect. -Well, the hour has come, now they're going to try

288
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:45,395
of Bogatyr's strength... -Don't go, Alyosha!

289
00:34:58,284 --> 00:35:00,991
-Hey... Huh?

290
00:35:14,922 --> 00:35:17,231
-Wait a minute, that's...

291
00:35:19,872 --> 00:35:24,115
-It can't be! -That's right, uncle, that's where he saw them.

292
00:35:24,642 --> 00:35:31,092
-That's right, when they were leaving with the gold. -Don't get upset, Alyosha, maybe we'll catch up.

293
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:34,850
-I don't understand, what's the problem? Did you come back?

294
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,120
-What's the problem with this cave?!

295
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:57,665
-That's right. Now none of the Russian bogeymen will laugh at you.

296
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:07,688
-Wait, that's an index stone. -Really? Tikhon, read it...

297
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:20,959
-"Ke. K-t-o. It's a-right-o-o-o-o-o-o...

298
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:23,288
-What's that?

299
00:36:23,227 --> 00:36:33,022
C-c-c-c-c-can't-just-get-it...

300
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:36,630
-Don't rush it, Tikhon. Concentrate. We'll break up the lagers,

301
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:42,063
...you'll be done by morning. -I'm just visually impaired... ...but I'm weak. Here.

302
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:44,984
-I see. -Then why don't you read it yourself?

303
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:49,363
-What's there to read? It says, "If you go left, you'll be rich. "To the right

304
00:36:49,255 --> 00:36:52,964
"If you go right, you'll be married, and if you go straight, you'll find your death.

305
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:58,306
-Right! So that's where we're going?! Straight.

306
00:37:09,203 --> 00:37:11,103
-Well, shall we go?

307
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:15,321
-Where did you get the stone, Alyosha?

308
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:19,844
-This is the place.

309
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:23,945
Let's go quickly, so we won't be late.

310
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:27,983
-What are you doing?

311
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:32,322
-Why are we running from the court, Alyosha? This is our happiness!

312
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:37,486
It's written that he'll be married. -What about Tugarin the Serpent?

313
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:42,091
What about Bogatyr's glory? -What about me? I'm already 16 years old, and I'm still

314
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:44,290
...and I'm still walking around as a maiden...

315
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:47,482
I'm going to stay an old maid. You're just afraid of a serious relationship.

316
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,408
-Who, me?! -Yes, you!

317
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,829
-What about the gold?

318
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,700
-By the way, the gold, it says right here.

319
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,255
-You'll be rich. So why should we risk it? I've heard that this

320
00:38:00,149 --> 00:38:03,550
Tugarin is a serious guy. What if I die in battle or get crippled?

321
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:07,678
No, the risk is noble, of course, but nothing can undermine

322
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,344
of my nobility is better than expensive harnesses and gold horseshoes.

323
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:16,366
-No, Julius, you don't understand, it's not just about gold, it's about making people

324
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:19,854
believe in us, you know? To be respected.

325
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:24,477
-Hy-hy-hy, don't make my horseshoes laugh. There's nothing like a fat wallet

326
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:29,430
A fat wallet, and faith, respect, and love will come with it.

327
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,947
-You don't sound like a bogatyr horse, but like a peddler at a bazaar.

328
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:36,735
-Wait a minute... Everyone has the right to happiness. -What do you mean?

329
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:42,572
-That everyone gets what he wants. -You're talking nonsense, Julius!

330
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:45,189
-And you don't respect other people's opinions!

331
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:52,476
-Croo-croo-croo-pooh... -Croo-croo-pooh...

332
00:38:53,495 --> 00:39:00,230
-Well... I didn't think we'd have to part, but I guess that's our fate. Let's go.

333
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:03,760
Tikhon, we'll manage on our own.

334
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:16,252
-And don't look for me, okay, I'll marry someone else and I'll have five... Not five, but ten

335
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:22,871
children. And there will be a household and a clever husband, such that woo! And he will love me and we will

336
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:28,206
live happily ever after and die on the same day... No, we'll never die! Here... Let's go to .

337
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:33,291
Grandma, let's find a real groom, not like this one.

338
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:46,273
-Where has it ever been seen that a woman is an order to a man?

339
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:50,082
-You've got the fashion to go against my word! -That's right.

340
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:55,997
-I'm afraid of a serious relationship... Ho-ho, I don't smile in the mirror because I'm...

341
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,885
¶ I'm not smiling at myself in the mirror ¶ -So what?

342
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,186
-I'll find so many other brides... !

343
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,821
-Why do you keep nodding off? -I'm not giving in.

344
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:08,763
-So go ahead and say it. -You can't let a woman get away with this!

345
00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:12,230
-You can't go against a man's word. -You can't go against a man's word. -That's right.

346
00:40:12,149 --> 00:40:14,856
-You don't smile at yourself when you go to the mirror.

347
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,229
-Don't you have an opinion? Don't you have an opinion? Yes, I do.

348
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:25,155
-I don't think you're a couple. -That's right.

349
00:40:25,108 --> 00:40:29,305
So what if she's the best-looking girl in Rostov?

350
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:32,495
-So what if she's the smartest girl in Rostov? -Yes...

351
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:36,353
-So what if you love her to death? Mm-hmm.

352
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:41,226
-So you'll marry someone else and be happy with her for the rest of your life. So what?

353
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:44,108
-You'll get by somehow.

354
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:54,311
-Uncle, I feel bad without her, I can't live without her! I love her!

355
00:40:55,645 --> 00:41:02,187
-When I get rich, I'll get married and settle down. I've had enough of these bogatyr adventures! I'm tired. I'll buy

356
00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:05,741
a palace with big stables... or two...

357
00:41:13,364 --> 00:41:17,824
So... where to next? Uh-oh, don't you know where the riches are?

358
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:23,758
-You want to get rich, stranger? -Who's there?

359
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:37,339
-Only today and only here is the biggest prize-two half-kingdoms, take a chance and feel the luck.

360
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:45,550
Well, do you want to play? -Yeah!

361
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:52,410
-Huh? ...On horseshoes!!! -Horseshoes, then horseshoes!

362
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:59,583
Put the horseshoes here and guess a number from one to ten. Just, I guess, you guess...

363
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,965
So, your number is... -Uh, three...

364
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:14,038
-That's right! Your winnings are ten points. Try again?!

365
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:19,826
-Of course, it's so easy! -And so... Place your bets.

366
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:26,033
-Hmm... another horseshoe? Well, it's settled... Your number... -Five...

367
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:31,608
-Right again! Yes! Ten more points! You're a lucky guy.

368
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:38,337
-Hee-hee. Lucky. Luck is my middle name. Give me another one.

369
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:42,089
-So, place your bet. -Hey, I'll bet anything.

370
00:42:43,817 --> 00:42:48,549
-Recognized. -And... the number? -Two.

371
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:52,486
-I like this guy, he won again!

372
00:42:56,886 --> 00:43:00,321
-Guys, it's not your day!

373
00:43:03,555 --> 00:43:08,640
-He thinks I'm weak-willed. -He probably is. -I'm gonna find a hundred more like him...

374
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:11,483
...just like him. -Okay.

375
00:43:11,415 --> 00:43:14,201
-Even better! -That's right.

376
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:17,147
-Nobody tells me what to do. -It's a fact.

377
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,849
-Do you agree with me on everything? -Yeah. -So what do you say to me?

378
00:43:21,744 --> 00:43:27,261
-Alyoschka, the naughty one... -That's right!

379
00:43:27,143 --> 00:43:31,330
-That's right, ba... -You'll marry the first guy you meet...

380
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:36,398
and live with him... -I will!

381
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:41,457
You'll cry into your pillow at night, remembering Alyosha.

382
00:43:41,362 --> 00:43:44,479
-I won't!

383
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:51,322
I need him, I can't live without him! I love him!

384
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:08,256
-Yee-tya, yee-tya, yee-tya, yee-tya... 40 points, 40 points! -It's time to play the super game!

385
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:13,609
And win two half-kings! -Yes, it's time, come on, come on!!!

386
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:20,430
-So, the bet is 100 points. -Yes, 100 points... Э.. But I only have 40?!

387
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:24,535
-Hmm... -Let me see...

388
00:44:27,568 --> 00:44:32,608
Okay, 40 points and your hide. -My hide?

389
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:35,934
-Your two half-kingdoms.

390
00:44:37,998 --> 00:44:42,457
-Agreed, it's a deal. -So, what's your number?

391
00:44:42,357 --> 00:44:48,159
-Okay, five was, three was, seven and nine were, so according to probability theory... -eight... -Yes..,

392
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:50,530
that's right, eight!

393
00:44:53,876 --> 00:45:00,213
-I'm sorry... but you lose... Hey, guys, skin him...

394
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:07,769
-Wait a minute, I'm asking for a continuance. I need a loan. I have a lot of connections.

395
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,094
I've got the scales of Novgorod behind me.

396
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:28,521
-Oh... the trail has gone sideways, I guess we'll hit their road just right.

397
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:32,028
-Hurry, Tikhon, follow me. -Oh...

398
00:45:31,943 --> 00:45:34,434
-Lyubava? -Alyosha!

399
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:37,546
-I have to tell you something. -No, it's me who should tell you.

400
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:40,226
-Don't argue with me. -Don't interrupt me.

401
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:52,227
-Good to see you guys... -I realized our strength is in unity, only together will we reach

402
00:45:52,122 --> 00:45:55,705
our high purpose... Friendship is our real wealth!

403
00:45:56,771 --> 00:46:00,593
Tremble, Tugarian army, the Bogatyr's horse is coming...

404
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:04,096
Well, let's not waste a minute, or someone else will take the gold...

405
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,242
I mean... someone else will take Tugarin's gold.

406
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:11,869
In short, let's go, friends... to the feat... !

407
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:27,237
-Hey!!! -hey-hey-hey...

408
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:33,689
-Hey, hey...

409
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:54,280
-Hey!

410
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:19,314
Peek-a-boo... Peek-a-boo...

411
00:47:22,845 --> 00:47:25,529
-Alyosha the Fool!

412
00:47:55,152 --> 00:48:00,806
Whether long or short, our heroes walked their difficult road, but in the evening

413
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:07,190
they reached the Tugarian camp and began to think about how to defeat Tugarin

414
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,885
and return the gold from Rostov to their homes.

415
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:18,447
-Well, it's time for the enemy to taste my heroic strength...

416
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:32,762
-Wait a minute, buddy, can you do that without a plan? -That's right! You can't do it without a plan!

417
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:41,756
-I'm surprised at you, have you ever heard of tactics, of strategy?

418
00:48:41,648 --> 00:48:44,003
The main thing for us is observation and stamina...

419
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:47,689
-What's there to watch and see? It's all clear.

420
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:51,339
We go in from four sides and...

421
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:57,438
-Whoa! -Wait, I think everyone in this situation

422
00:48:57,327 --> 00:49:00,467
should have a say in this situation. -What are you talking about?

423
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:07,393
-Moses and I, Moses and I believe that the best battle is the one that never happened.

424
00:49:08,056 --> 00:49:12,220
-Oops. What? -It's all about diplomacy in the world these days. Maybe

425
00:49:12,126 --> 00:49:15,618
Maybe we should talk to these guys, get to their heartstrings, play on their feelings.

426
00:49:16,676 --> 00:49:21,169
-All right, then you go. -No. -No, Moses and

427
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:24,967
Tikhon... Moses isn't as hot-tempered as me, and Tikhon isn't sorry.

428
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:30,673
Just kidding... You have to admit, you can't look at him without tears! I mean, who'd want to be seen with such a man...

429
00:49:30,574 --> 00:49:35,068
who'd have the guts to kill someone like that? -That's enough, I'm fed up. Tonight we'll sneak into their

430
00:49:34,964 --> 00:49:38,491
We'll sneak into their camps at night and take the gold...

431
00:49:38,804 --> 00:49:44,742
-That's my kind of thing. -That's my kind of thing. You can do it at night without me. -Crrrrr!

432
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:21,934
-Hoo... Hoo-hoo!

433
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,198
-Yum, yum, yum! -Tsk-tsk-tsk!

434
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:59,717
-Igo-go, how... -Hush, you wretched man!!!

435
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:05,268
-Shoosh, guys, let me go... I've got myself under control.

436
00:51:05,177 --> 00:51:10,478
-What the hell did he do with the gold?! -What's wrong?

437
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:14,565
-How can we look people in the eye? -What's the matter?

438
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:18,084
-Is that any way to treat other people's goods? -Will somebody explain to me what's going on here?

439
00:51:18,006 --> 00:51:22,170
what's going on here? -Gold is gold. So they melted it down,

440
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,930
so what's the big deal?

441
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:31,566
-And how can I find my tooth now?

442
00:51:43,794 --> 00:51:46,718
-What are you making noise for?!

443
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:09,829
-I can't do this... are we thieves or what? We've come for our own!

444
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:17,941
Come on, you Basurmans, fight fair and brave... !

445
00:52:17,821 --> 00:52:20,608
-Oh, you fool... !!

446
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,548
-Eh?!

447
00:53:38,025 --> 00:53:42,563
-Alyosha...

448
00:53:42,454 --> 00:53:46,003
-Is there room? -No. No. No!

449
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:44,682
-Didn't fall. -Didn't fall.

450
00:54:48,229 --> 00:54:53,394
-Uh... ! -Ugh, I think we got away!

451
00:54:53,279 --> 00:54:55,349
-Help me!

452
00:54:55,299 --> 00:54:59,257
-Find me at the old oak tree.

453
00:54:59,168 --> 00:55:05,312
If you bring me the gold, I'll bring back the girl.

454
00:55:07,308 --> 00:55:13,382
-So, Tikhon, Grandma, take Moses and take the gold home to Rostov.

455
00:55:13,237 --> 00:55:18,265
and I'll go with Julius to rescue Lyubava... -No, I'll go with you to get Lyubava too...

456
00:55:19,117 --> 00:55:23,598
-Understand, grandma, you'll only be a burden to us, and there's no time to lose.

457
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:28,513
-Wait, wait, wait, you mean we're just going to trust these guys with the gold?

458
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:32,799
-What guys? -I'm surprised at you, you have no

459
00:55:32,706 --> 00:55:38,086
You don't know anything about people... Look at them closely... It's like...

460
00:55:37,965 --> 00:55:43,676
a real gang, a gang of criminals... The three of them are scarier than Tugarin! They'll take the gold and...

461
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:48,731
-I don't get it! -What's there to understand... If you take that money...

462
00:55:48,624 --> 00:55:52,628
...and divide it among the five... among the four...

463
00:55:58,294 --> 00:56:02,195
No... for three... Tikhon and Grandma have enough for one share.

464
00:56:03,453 --> 00:56:05,717
Why, they've got less to live for...

465
00:56:06,253 --> 00:56:11,008
-What about the people of Rostov? -Ha-ha, don't be ridiculous... um...

466
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:17,183
What people? The people, if I'm not mistaken, wanted to stake you!.. Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

467
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:23,661
-Listen, if you don't shut up now, I'll turn you over to the varmints and they'll make a sausage out of you

468
00:56:23,522 --> 00:56:26,388
...and they'll make a sausage out of you in no time.

469
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:32,822
-А.. That's why I love him. He didn't give in to the provocation.

470
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:41,680
-What are you standing around for? Come on, let's go. People in Rostov are getting too greedy... Oh... they're waiting!

471
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,495
-We don't want to leave you alone... -What do I mean? Everyone has to go together.

472
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:54,210
-No, we won't pamper you with human gold a second time. I think so. Let's go.

473
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:59,874
-It wasn't right to let them go alone, after all.

474
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:04,646
-Yes, they can hardly manage on their own... -What are we going to do? -What are we going to do?

475
00:57:04,978 --> 00:57:10,280
-I think we'll leave the gold to the Prince of Kiev,

476
00:57:10,158 --> 00:57:13,309
and we ourselves will go to help Alesha...

477
00:57:18,127 --> 00:57:21,392
-You know, I wanted to ask you... About your phrase...

478
00:57:22,287 --> 00:57:25,927
-What line? -The one about the vultures. Could you really...

479
00:57:25,857 --> 00:57:27,960
to hand me over to the vultures?

480
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:35,424
-Well, you know... -Wait, wait, wait, I just want to hear...

481
00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:39,839
Yes or no? -Well... No..

482
00:57:39,736 --> 00:57:45,367
-I almost believed you, and your eyes were so natural.

483
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:51,476
-Listen, could you walk, my back's hurting so bad.

484
00:57:54,494 --> 00:57:59,898
-Yeah, we've had a tough time... -Not everyone can take it.

485
00:57:59,774 --> 00:58:04,598
-But that's all right, at least the people of Rostov will be happy.

486
00:58:09,603 --> 00:58:12,458
-Well, here we are.

487
00:58:58,779 --> 00:59:01,282
-To cut off their heads!

488
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:06,240
-I wonder how Tikhon and Moses got there.

489
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:10,645
-Oh, I'm worried myself. They trusted them with the gold, and it's human, no, but I'm sure in Moses,

490
00:59:10,538 --> 00:59:13,371
I'm sure he's a normal guy, but Tikhon...

491
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:16,930
-Remember Julius, I trust Tikhon like I trust myself.

492
00:59:20,218 --> 00:59:22,071
-He's like a brother to me.

493
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:27,498
They're just so defenseless.

494
00:59:27,877 --> 00:59:32,837
-Don't execute him, Prince. Say your prayers.

495
00:59:34,496 --> 00:59:36,873
-Come on, what have you got there?

496
00:59:38,056 --> 00:59:42,322
-We've come to you from the people of Rostov, Grand Duke of Kiev...

497
00:59:42,226 --> 00:59:44,956
-And what need brought you here?

498
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:53,267
And Tikhon told the Prince of Kiev the story that there are still heroes in Russia.

499
00:59:53,105 --> 00:59:59,327
but until Tikhon finishes the job he started, Tugarin won't punish the evil one, and Alyosha and Lyubava

500
00:59:59,184 --> 01:00:06,215
and Lyubava, there's no one to look after the gold, so Tikhon beats an oath.

501
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:15,060
-Yeah, that's an interesting story.

502
01:00:15,703 --> 01:00:18,536
Look at this thing...

503
01:00:35,172 --> 01:00:40,017
-Hmm..., yes..., the ball is curious, I would say, original...

504
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:42,135
So, what did you say your name was?

505
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:53,827
-We should have a squad of men, and leave the gold with you, prince, for safekeeping.

506
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:59,168
-I can't give you men, you know, the time is not calm, and I have every druzhinnik in the account.

507
01:01:02,469 --> 01:01:07,463
And leave the gold, as it is. If not to the Prince of Kiev, then to whom is the faith?

508
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:10,625
It's such a thing, that a constant guard is needed...

509
01:01:13,279 --> 01:01:16,907
-Thank you, Prince. -Go with God.

510
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:32,478
-I wonder where in Rostov we get so much gold.

511
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:43,579
-Where is that oak tree? -I'm sorry, but I can't see it from here, and anyway,

512
01:01:43,496 --> 01:01:47,307
are you sure this is a good plan? -No, but it's the only one I got.

513
01:01:47,906 --> 01:01:53,013
-So here's the deal... Tugarin gives you Lyubava, and you give him the bag of gold...

514
01:01:52,895 --> 01:01:56,831
there's no gold in the sack, it's me in the sack! And you're giving me to Tugarin?

515
01:01:56,745 --> 01:02:00,067
Well, stop, let me out! -I'll be all right.

516
01:01:59,985 --> 01:02:03,512
-No, let me out now, or I'll get hysterical!!!

517
01:02:03,435 --> 01:02:06,346
-I said I'm not leaving you!

518
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:47,742
-Where is my gold?

519
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:52,529
-Where is the gold, I know, but first I would like to know my share.

520
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:02,335
-Gotcha!!! -I know. Gold must be shared.

521
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,728
-Oh, and he says something about gold.

522
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:12,556
-How about..., you're 40 and I'm 60, what do you think?

523
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:17,996
All right, all right... in half!

524
01:03:17,949 --> 01:03:20,451
-Hey, that's our horse!

525
01:03:48,686 --> 01:03:51,610
-Lubawa. ! -Alyosha!

526
01:03:51,546 --> 01:03:57,370
-Alyosha!

527
01:03:58,605 --> 01:04:01,915
-Excuse me, Luba, I have to help Julia.

528
01:04:12,554 --> 01:04:15,296
-Who are you? А?

529
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:19,284
-It doesn't matter, he's our horse!

530
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:26,437
-I am Tugarin the Serpent, have you ever heard of him?

531
01:04:26,323 --> 01:04:30,419
-We've heard of him, but he's our horse, he owes us money...

532
01:04:32,263 --> 01:04:41,910
-What? That horse is mine! He knows where my gold is hidden!

533
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:46,250
-Guys, that's my horse!

534
01:04:47,841 --> 01:04:52,084
-Who are you? -I'm a warrior from Rostov, Alyosha Popovich,

535
01:04:51,981 --> 01:04:54,916
I've come to keep my word.

536
01:04:54,911 --> 01:04:58,711
-A bogatyr...

537
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:12,175
-Where's my gold? -It's not yours!

538
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:17,424
-That's right, the gold is ours! -Alyosha...

539
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:10,163
-Alyosha! -No, I didn't.

540
01:06:10,365 --> 01:06:15,200
-Huh? -Hu-hu-hu-hu!

541
01:06:27,634 --> 01:06:29,806
-Fall!

542
01:06:38,503 --> 01:06:44,691
-Alyosha! -Ah... Ah... Oh...

543
01:06:48,082 --> 01:06:52,519
Did I do that to him? -Yes, you, Alyosha!

544
01:06:56,311 --> 01:06:59,314
-I don't remember anything. -No wonder...

545
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:05,601
-Quiet, you're here, Grandma, how did you end up here?

546
01:07:05,451 --> 01:07:09,056
-Don't worry, we did everything you told us to do.

547
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:13,521
We left the gold to the Prince of Kiev for safekeeping, and we decided to help you.

548
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,436
-And we got there just in time... -Gee-goo...

549
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,609
-We should tie him up before he wakes up.

550
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:26,158
-Wake up...? Ha! He's safe for now!

551
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:30,551
-Pardon me... !

552
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:35,770
Well, how are you? -Huh?

553
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:44,882
-Well, now we'll take the gold and go home.

554
01:07:44,787 --> 01:07:50,566
-And let the people of Kiev admire Tugarin. Mm-hmm!

555
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:22,299
-Oh... Ya... Ya... Y-a...

556
01:08:22,194 --> 01:08:24,765
-Hello, Prince of Kiev!

557
01:08:27,544 --> 01:08:32,527
-Hello, hello, hello, hero of Rostov!

558
01:08:32,414 --> 01:08:38,488
Come, sit down... Come to the table, be my guest!

559
01:08:38,343 --> 01:08:42,484
-Don't take it as an impudence, Prince, but I have no time to feast,

560
01:08:42,393 --> 01:08:48,103
The people of Rostov are waiting for me. They're waiting with their belongings, taken away by Tugarin...

561
01:08:48,732 --> 01:08:50,825
-Oh?!

562
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:55,342
-Well, as you know, it's necessary, so it's necessary.

563
01:08:55,282 --> 01:08:57,034
Go with God...

564
01:08:56,992 --> 01:09:00,427
So what did you say happened next?

565
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:07,600
-Don't be angry, Grand Duke, but you must have forgotten that you have Rostov's gold...

566
01:09:07,471 --> 01:09:10,690
in your custody?

567
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,864
-Huh? Ah! Yes, yes, I remember...

568
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:21,251
Hey, there... bring the bogatyr his gold...

569
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:32,571
-Aah!!!

570
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:50,042
-It is not good, Prince, to offend simple people. ! -How did I offend anyone?

571
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:52,589
I only took my share for keeping it.

572
01:09:54,387 --> 01:09:58,642
-Well, prince, you've amused yourself enough with me...

573
01:09:58,547 --> 01:10:04,018
It's my turn to make jokes. Try some of this bogatyr's strength...

574
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,621
-А!!! Wait, wait, Rostov bogatyr, don't get excited...

575
01:10:10,536 --> 01:10:14,518
I can see how tough you are... I'm just the kind of vigilantes I need!

576
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:20,373
Stay here, Alyosha. You'll be fed, clothed, and endowed with the prince's affection!

577
01:10:20,835 --> 01:10:24,942
-Don't be angry, Prince of Kiev, but they're waiting for us at home, in Rostov,

578
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:28,132
and without gold there's no way back for us.

579
01:10:31,444 --> 01:10:34,902
And so it was agreed. And the prince returned the gold,

580
01:10:34,824 --> 01:10:39,931
Tugarin Alyosha left the Prince of Kiev as a gift, the Prince

581
01:10:39,813 --> 01:10:46,184
put him in a cage to please the people of Kiev, the people like to be amused.

582
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:05,872
-And, I wonder, for our exploits we don't get a share of the gold, by any chance?

583
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:08,574
Or a title of some kind?

584
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:15,084
-Well, hello, our father Rostov! We've brought back the gold of the people!

585
01:11:48,368 --> 01:11:51,769
-Aah!!! God has heard us!

586
01:12:05,247 --> 01:12:08,625
-Oh, look at that! The bad guy's back!

587
01:12:09,466 --> 01:12:12,344
-Yeah. -Yeah. You're respected here.

588
01:12:12,276 --> 01:12:16,542
-Oh, look, it's my ring! -It's not yours, it's ours!

589
01:12:16,446 --> 01:12:19,347
-You've never had gold in your life!

590
01:12:19,276 --> 01:12:23,257
-Let go of my father, let go of my father! -We're good, aren't we?

591
01:12:24,765 --> 01:12:28,201
Well... I helped you, help me too...

592
01:12:28,115 --> 01:12:31,482
One tree there owes me four horseshoes...
