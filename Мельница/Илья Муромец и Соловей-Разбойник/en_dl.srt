1
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:25,024
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,128
...when the forests were full of mushrooms and berries,

3
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:32,581
...and the ponds and rivers were full of fish,

4
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,275
...the people of Mother Russia lived...

5
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:36,973
...and they had no trouble.

6
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:48,001
And then all of a sudden...

7
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,446
...bad things began to happen.

8
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,544
Out of nowhere,

9
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,586
...a villain appeared,

10
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,504
...the Bandit Nightingale.

11
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:29,130
Not a horse,

12
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,681
...or a foot soldier.

13
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,360
He burned and plundered...

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,277
...the Russian villages.

15
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:10,941
Ilya!

16
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:22,199
Well, help me,

17
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,117
...mother of the earth.

18
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,666
Nice horse you have, Ilya!

19
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,047
Why don't you sell it?

20
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,224
It's not a horse at all,

21
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,381
...but my faithful friend!

22
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:56,302
Well Ilya, my time will come, wait!

23
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,220
Relax!

24
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:03,888
Oh, thank you, Ilya Ivanovich!

25
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,911
Don't leave us, bogatyr!

26
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:08,874
- Come back! - Don't forget us, Ilyashenka!

27
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,118
Bon voyage and good luck!

28
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,084
We're waiting for you, our defender!

29
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:15,136
I'll be back.

30
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:17,256
What did he say?

31
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:19,164
"I'll be back!"

32
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:40,021
So... This is for social needs...

33
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,311
This is for the vigilantes...

34
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,834
And this is for other expenses.

35
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,471
That's a lot of other stuff.

36
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:55,173
Yeah, that's right.

37
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,905
What if we raise taxes?

38
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:04,600
Let's say they don't pay a tithe,

39
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,843
...but let's say a quarter?

40
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,915
What... what do you think?

41
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:10,833
How about cutting "other things"?

42
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,751
But-but-but! Aren't you, by any chance..,

43
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:13,566
...not a democrat?

44
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,107
Dibs on me! God be with you, Prince!

45
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:17,373
That's right!

46
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:19,799
Look at me!

47
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:07,632
Isn't it true that they say you let Nightingale go again...

48
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:10,049
...for a hundred coins?

49
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:12,321
It's state business, it's none of your business.

50
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,639
Why, I'm like a dog..,

51
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,941
...I'll chase after every bandit..,

52
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:20,923
...and you let him go free again?

53
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,841
What's the matter with you? Are you out of your mind?

54
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,491
Mind your own business!

55
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:26,408
I'm a prince, I do what I want!

56
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,787
I'm acting in the interests of the state!

57
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,561
Oh, yes!

58
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,361
There's a lot to be done that way.

59
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:35,279
That's it! I've had enough!

60
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,254
Look at you! You've gone crazy!

61
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:38,913
Get out of here!

62
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:40,841
I'll go, Prince,

63
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:42,759
...only for the service henceforth...

64
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:45,386
...don't call me. Period!

65
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:54,583
Go, go! Without you, there will be some heroes in Russia.

66
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,501
Don't forget to leave your horse!

67
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:58,419
What do you mean, leave it?

68
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:00,231
Burushka?

69
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,207
- How could I, Prince! - How?

70
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,167
It's on the balance sheet, it's government property.

71
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:08,967
No, you can pay, of course,

72
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,885
...if you have money.

73
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,269
Did you see that?

74
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:20,187
What's up?

75
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,594
Prince, there... ...there's...

76
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:24,512
...that chronicler has come to see you!

77
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,519
Again?

78
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:27,590
I told you not to let him in!

79
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:29,508
They're getting attached...

80
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:31,349
Don't let them in, Prince...

81
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,689
...they'll scribble nasty things again!

82
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:37,468
So what do you want me to do?

83
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:39,807
Oh... Well, of course I have to ask!

84
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,725
Why do you ask, you fool!

85
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:56,388
Don't grieve, Burushka,

86
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,878
...I'll definitely buy you back.

87
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:01,796
I'll make some money!

88
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:04,405
Why..,

89
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:07,541
...I can plow the land,

90
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:09,458
...sow bread...

91
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:12,585
Well, don't be clever.

92
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:14,503
Hey, Stepan!

93
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:17,073
You comb his mane, but watch out,

94
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:18,617
...don't cut it!

95
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:20,563
You'll reduce his strength,

96
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,481
...you'll take grief for yourself.

97
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,399
You got it, Ilya Ivanovich!

98
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,343
A star fell from the sky at night.

99
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,856
Good omen!

100
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,742
I made a wish.

101
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,207
Before you know it,

102
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,125
...we'll be together.

103
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:57,502
We've come a long way, haven't we?

104
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,238
In the old days, I would have written these

105
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,156
...in no time at all!

106
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,074
Shackles! To the dungeon!

107
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,634
And now, you see, people want to know the truth.

108
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:08,041
What will say in the West!

109
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,466
О... Baba!

110
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,866
Mmm, pretty.

111
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,659
How did you get in here, honey?

112
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,999
I'm not a broad, I'm a chronicler!

113
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,917
Of the weekly "New Birch"!

114
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,835
You're a... A chronicler?

115
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:37,999
Yes! And I want to know by what right I'm not allowed into the palace!

116
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:40,339
By what right am I barred from the palace? What on earth is this?

117
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:42,804
Do you confirm the resignation of Ilya Muromets?

118
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:45,287
They say he accused you of conspiring with Nightingale the Robber?

119
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,170
That's not true!

120
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,088
Let him prove it first!

121
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,504
That's true. The law is that if you're not caught, you're not a thief.

122
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,899
А... э... Metaphorically!

123
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,365
Get him out of here! Take him away! Sketching in the palace is forbidden!

124
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,980
You know what?

125
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:04,438
What is your name?

126
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,835
- Alyonushka... - What a wonderful name!

127
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,533
Well, Alyonushka,

128
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,451
...they won't let us talk to you here.

129
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:12,369
Let's go to my office.

130
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,080
Don't let them execute you, soul of the Russian land!

131
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,321
Did you see that?

132
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,798
What happened again?

133
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,716
The treasury, my dear prince!

134
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,125
What - the treasury?

135
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,906
The bandit nightingale, the damned bandit..,

136
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,824
...has stolen the treasury!

137
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:32,046
What will be your further actions?

138
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:39,872
Did you make it? I need a close-up!

139
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,332
Having gathered my spirit,

140
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,671
...and having come to a wise mind..,

141
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:02,858
...the prince began to think and decide,

142
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,776
...how to catch the thief,

143
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,885
...and steal the riches.

144
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:09,120
Catch them!

145
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,316
Catch them!

146
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,480
A bogatyr in pursuit!

147
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,207
Don't order the execution, Prince,

148
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,125
...but where to get a bogatyr?

149
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:21,126
Ilya Ivanovich went home in anger.

150
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:25,355
I hold a grudge against you, fair Prince!

151
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:27,657
And Nightingale also took the horse..,

152
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:29,575
...of Murom!

153
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,046
Listen, fair Prince..,

154
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:36,230
...what if Ilyushka doesn't say a word about the treasury?

155
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,483
And tell me about the horse!

156
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:41,005
He's sick before the horse,

157
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,731
He'll go to help him out,

158
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,896
...and at the same time help our treasury!

159
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,706
That's right! We must urgently go to Ilya.

160
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:52,244
Don't say a word about the treasury from the chest!

161
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:55,102
Listen, Prince, can I go with you to Ilya Ivanovich?

162
00:11:55,102 --> 00:11:56,330
I'm writing a chronicle.

163
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,247
"Weekdays of Russian Heroes" is called.

164
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:01,076
Right. Who let her in?

165
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,001
You yourself, Prince, ordered it.

166
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:05,957
I used to order it. And now I don't!

167
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:08,182
That's it! Take her away.

168
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,697
The opal.

169
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:10,733
This is an outrage!

170
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,594
Violence against the press!

171
00:12:12,594 --> 00:12:14,598
Freedom to the pen and the word!

172
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:16,516
Freedom to the pen and the word!

173
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:25,309
And Ilya Muromets plows the earth,

174
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,920
...and knits his shoes.

175
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,184
We have only one thought,

176
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:32,952
...to redeem his friend from the prince.

177
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:34,870
Come, mother,

178
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:37,814
...I'm not tired yet.

179
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,979
Don't argue with your mother! You look completely gray.

180
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:42,235
Skin and bones.

181
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:45,860
I think it's time for you to get married, son.

182
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,270
To whom?

183
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:50,511
What difference does it make? To this one or that one.

184
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:53,810
For example, Varvara, our blacksmith's daughter.

185
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:56,265
Her cheeks are red, she's strong...

186
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:56,945
...ugh!

187
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:58,863
That's why she's red,

188
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,251
...because she won't leave the blacksmith's furnace.

189
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:04,809
All right. Let's have a look at Glasha.

190
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:07,072
I've got a lot to look at.

191
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:10,994
I don't like that girl.

192
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:12,577
Ugh, not to my taste!

193
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:14,542
What do you want to make cabbage soup out of her?

194
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,460
Well, mother!

195
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:19,069
A fly in the milk...

196
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:21,428
Wait for visitors, Mama!

197
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,084
It's an omen!

198
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:26,002
An omen...

199
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:30,519
Are you going to look for a wife by omens too?

200
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,708
Why not?

201
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,626
You can't escape fate!

202
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:36,464
It will show you a sign..,

203
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,130
...when I meet my soulmate.

204
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:41,048
Ehhh!

205
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,833
Oh, you're too much, someone's really galloping!

206
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,487
The prince has come.

207
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:52,690
It's no wonder something happened.

208
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:56,775
It can't be that the Prince himself has done the honors!

209
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,105
Oh, you, naked, not cleaned up!

210
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,023
Trouble! Oh, trouble!

211
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,566
Oh, you dark yoke!

212
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,827
Good health to you,

213
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:12,166
...bright Prince of Kiev..,

214
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,967
...the hope of Russian cities!

215
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,884
Mother!

216
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:22,859
Ilya Ivanovich! The bandit nightingale is on the loose again!

217
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,125
What's it to me?

218
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,043
These are matters of state..,

219
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:29,092
...and I have nothing to do with them.

220
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,534
Ah... Ilya Ivanovich,

221
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:40,465
...ah... You have stolen a sacred thing.

222
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:44,397
He stole your horse, Burushka..,

223
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,226
...our falcon, from the stable!

224
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:49,681
What do you mean he stole it? When?

225
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:51,599
Last night.

226
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,150
Don't abandon your faithful friend!

227
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,809
Follow him! Keep up!

228
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:17,961
Good day to you, my hostess!

229
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,675
Can you tell me where I can find a hero, Ilya Muromets?

230
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:23,053
He was standing here, plowing the land,

231
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,863
...and when the prince arrived, he jumped on his horse,

232
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:27,685
...and rushed away in the wind.

233
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:30,993
I'm late! And you yourself, who will be Ilya?

234
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:34,311
I'm his mother, of course!

235
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:35,452
Oh, great!

236
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:38,147
And tell me how the hero's mother feels,

237
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:40,305
...- pride for her son, anxiety, confusion?

238
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:43,623
Ah... You're right. Anxiety!

239
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:46,806
Ilyusha forgot to take his cherished little bundle!

240
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:48,456
And I didn't even remind him!

241
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:49,846
Oh, so give it to me!

242
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:52,052
I'll meet him now, of course.

243
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,389
Come on, come on! Don't doubt it.

244
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,391
They shaved it off!

245
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:15,479
A tribe of Basurians!

246
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:18,279
Aya-ya-ya-ya-ya, what a misfortune!

247
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,449
M-m-m!

248
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:26,354
You, Prince, tell them to give me my armor,

249
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:28,531
...and let them find a stronger horse!

250
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:31,264
- I'm leaving tomorrow. - Hey there, what are you waiting for?

251
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,524
...equip the Russian bogatyr for the dangerous journey!

252
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:43,654
For this righteous cause I decided to go with you, Ilya Ivanovich.

253
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,003
I'll help you in your difficult feat.

254
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,566
No way!

255
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:50,731
I'm not taking a wagon to the campaign!

256
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:53,099
Ilya! I'm really embarrassed!

257
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,458
It seems to be my fault...

258
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,616
...that Burushka was stolen...

259
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,534
I say no.

260
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:02,420
And I say yes.

261
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:04,338
I say no!

262
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:10,140
And I say yes! After all, the honor of the state is affected!

263
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,350
Damn you to hell!

264
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,023
Ha! Good omen.

265
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:21,954
Well! Your luck, Prince. But be warned,

266
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:25,061
...the two of us will go. Quickly, but lightly.

267
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:26,979
Good?

268
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:57,417
Come on. А!

269
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,622
Come on! Don't be afraid!

270
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,166
Come on!

271
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:08,272
She doesn't want to go. She's stubborn!

272
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:10,996
She's... afraid of heights!

273
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:24,738
So you've got her stabled!

274
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,969
How on earth did you get her on the road?

275
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,559
I did! And I didn't notice.

276
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,400
Oh! Aren't you Ilya Muromets?

277
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,145
That's the one!

278
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,638
Do you know me?

279
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,758
Who doesn't know Ilya Muromets?

280
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,915
Thank you, you've helped me out.

281
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:42,344
It's nothing.

282
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:44,646
It's no accident that we met, Ilya Ivanovich!

283
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:47,053
How so - not by chance?

284
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:50,438
Here, I'm writing a chronicle, "Weekdays of Russian Heroes"!

285
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:52,356
My dream is to go on a hike with you!

286
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:53,880
To save Burushka...

287
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,798
To the campaign?

288
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:58,838
Well, yes. And I also have an errand for you!

289
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,756
From your mother.

290
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:04,045
Ouch. I don't know where I was going with that!

291
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,520
An errand from my mother...

292
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:10,240
(in the background: No, that's not it...) Stop talking to me!

293
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:13,319
What about the hike, Ilya Ivanovich?

294
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:25,526
How the hell did they get wind of the treasury?

295
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:28,537
It's our competition. Nothing is sacred to them at all.

296
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:30,839
That's freedom of speech!

297
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,440
- Ooh! - You don't say!

298
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,739
Tomorrow all the morning chronicles will mention the horse and the treasury...

299
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,705
What if Ilya Ivanovich accidentally reads it?

300
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:39,412
Ugh! Hey, get the executioner over here!

301
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,078
Wait, Prince! The executioner is no help here.

302
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,823
What is written with a pen, you can't chop with an axe!

303
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:46,518
Yes? He's such a virtuoso...

304
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,330
And what will the people say?

305
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,989
That's just it!

306
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:51,572
And I can easily fix it,

307
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:53,585
...if you take me camping with you.

308
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,302
Camping?!

309
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:57,392
I'll write a chronicle about your courage!

310
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:59,310
Material for me, respect for you!

311
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,468
About courage?

312
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:04,057
Well... Why not?

313
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:05,457
It's a deal!

314
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:07,366
And Ilya Ivanovich won't mind?

315
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,344
Ilya?

316
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:11,518
Who is he? I've got dozens like him!

317
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:13,551
Hundreds of them! After all..,

318
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:15,785
...am I or am I not a prince?

319
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:48,054
What's that?

320
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:49,972
Where?

321
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:53,616
- The posse! - What brigade?

322
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:55,189
What did we agree on?

323
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:56,829
Are you crazy, Ilya!

324
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,622
What kind of a prince goes without a retinue!

325
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,559
So... That's it!

326
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,755
- Kar! - What's "kar"? - Kar!

327
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:10,705
Ah! Almost too late.

328
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:12,623
Are we moving?

329
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:17,648
Are you all..,

330
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:18,952
...conspiring?

331
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:20,908
Why? Let her come with us.

332
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:23,172
It's more fun on the road.

333
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:49,332
They took the sour cream. Thieves.

334
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:58,413
We will walk from the edge of the forest.

335
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:01,779
What do you mean on foot? I'm not going anywhere on foot!

336
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:07,370
Shouldn't we send you back to Kiev, Prince?

337
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:10,352
What do you mean, send you back to Kiev? Who are you?

338
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,548
To send a prince!

339
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:22,522
"...to send a prince?"

340
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:33,425
You know, Ilya,

341
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:39,112
...I'm an easy-going person by nature.

342
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:46,870
I have a temper sometimes, but otherwise I don't hold a grudge against anyone. Uh-huh!

343
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:00,861
What now?

344
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:03,882
Shh! The birds have fallen silent.

345
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:06,979
What do we need birds for? We're not out hunting.

346
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:10,067
A beast and a bird can always sense trouble.

347
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:12,321
We're not the only ones here.

348
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,392
Ah! Oh, no!

349
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,470
There's a cone over there, fallen on the trail!

350
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,728
Expect snow for supper!

351
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:25,410
People have been noticing omens for centuries!

352
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,038
They always tell the truth.

353
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:32,641
What am I, a little child, listening to fairy tales, ha! The omens!

354
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:52,904
Ilya Ivanovich!

355
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,289
Ilya Ivanovich! I have an errand for you.

356
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,907
From your mother...

357
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,429
Ilya Ivanovich!

358
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:18,383
Tell me, is Nightingale ,

359
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:20,426
...is that your first or last name?

360
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:26,410
What made you take the slippery path of robbery and robbery?

361
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:29,105
Not us! Life is like that!

362
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:31,866
- That's a good devil! - Tie her up, boys!

363
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,148
We'll spend the night here.

364
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,970
Here?

365
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:46,922
Look around you! The tree is dry, and the owl isn't screaming for good.

366
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:50,892
It's a dead place.

367
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:54,018
What's it to you? You don't believe in omens.

368
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:57,777
Well, you know! You said it yourself - people have been noticing omens for centuries!

369
00:24:57,777 --> 00:25:01,633
- In general, it's not quiet here somehow. - That's it. We're done discussing.

370
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:03,896
Time for bed.

371
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,134
You're on watch till midnight.

372
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,522
- Me? Yeah, you.

373
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,725
What's the big deal? Then I'll take over for you.

374
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:17,887
Everyone is equal here, okay? Democracy!

375
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,363
Here you go.

376
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:27,822
- Democracy will lead you to turmoil! - Prince!

377
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:30,929
Don't sleep a wink!

378
00:26:15,952 --> 00:26:19,260
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

379
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,950
Well, well, well. What kind of fish got into our net?

380
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,536
- Probably a merchant. Or a boyar. - What's the matter with you?

381
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:31,372
You're so dark! Can't you see - the Prince is standing in front of you!

382
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,460
Or rather, you're standing in front of the Prince!

383
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,716
Behead!

384
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:37,941
You uneducated bastard!

385
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,760
You mock pheasant!

386
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,615
Listen to me! The Bandit Nightingale himself put me in charge here,

387
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,916
...so tell me now who I am,

388
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,352
...or we'll take your head off your shoulders right away.

389
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,447
I told you, the Prince is before you!

390
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:06,825
Order me to untie him at once,

391
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,551
...and fall at your feet!

392
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:11,054
- Maybe the Prince will forgive you. - Ah!

393
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:46,900
Oh, Ilya, you won't believe it,

394
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:48,338
...I'm so glad to see you!

395
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:50,659
And you, Prince, well done,

396
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,184
...you're not afraid.

397
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:55,483
You say, "Ha-ha-ha-ha!

398
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:58,388
Of course!

399
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:06,213
What the hell is that?

400
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:08,131
Where did she come from?

401
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:10,778
They're conspiring behind my back!

402
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:13,022
No way, Ilya! Here's your cross!

403
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:17,443
And in general, a woman in a campaign is always useful.

404
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,885
I mean, cooking..,

405
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:23,177
...or do the laundry! My sleeves are dirty.

406
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:26,141
No! We'll leave it here.

407
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:28,317
It won't be a problem.

408
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:42,664
I am! Yes you!

409
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,601
Yes... How dare you!

410
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:45,934
I didn't do it for nothing!

411
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:49,280
I wanted to publicize the everyday life of Russian heroes!

412
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,572
А... And you...

413
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:55,149
Thus, the operation, code-named "Vengeance"...

414
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:57,527
...was led personally by the Prince of Kiev.

415
00:28:58,275 --> 00:28:59,580
Did you write it down?

416
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,687
From the first steps luck smiled on the prince.

417
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:04,442
And-and-and...

418
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,805
...and his entourage!

419
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:11,145
Luck has nothing to do with it.

420
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:13,619
It's just military cunning,

421
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:14,827
...nothing more.

422
00:29:14,827 --> 00:29:17,071
How so? Can you be more specific?

423
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:21,434
It's not difficult. I've got a sign of an outlaw place,

424
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:24,436
...and then I took them as bait.

425
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:27,591
- You know, like fishing. - So that's it,

426
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:30,190
...that I was your live-bait?!

427
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,357
Easy, Prince, easy!

428
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,589
- I'm telling you, it's just a military trick. - You!

429
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,530
You endangered the life of the head of state!

430
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,793
That's... of... treason!

431
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:44,497
Look! He's awake...

432
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:55,055
So, are you going to tell me where Nightingale is?

433
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:58,095
...or shall I write you a second invitation?

434
00:29:58,095 --> 00:29:59,630
He's gone over the sea.

435
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,116
He went to Tsargrad.

436
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:03,034
As soon as the treasury of the prince... у... м...

437
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:05,173
To Tsargrad? Are you sure? To Tsargrad?

438
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,644
Wait, Prince! You have to open his mouth.

439
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,830
How will he talk?

440
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,998
- Well? - That's what I'm saying,

441
00:30:12,998 --> 00:30:14,916
- ...as soon as the treasury... - You'll talk in substance..,

442
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:17,102
...answer in substance!

443
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,768
- About Tsargrad! - Well, Prince,

444
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:21,552
...let him speak.

445
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,959
The Nightingale told him to wait for a sign,

446
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:26,346
...took the knight's horse and the prince's treasury..,

447
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:28,341
- ...and left. - He's delirious!

448
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:32,014
Your hand, Ilya, is heavy!

449
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:34,143
So...

450
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,895
So you say..,

451
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:39,964
...you took the treasury of the prince?

452
00:30:43,512 --> 00:30:46,264
You thought you'd use my hands to settle your affairs?

453
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:49,150
- Not your own! - Listen, wait! - Not your own, but the state's!

454
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:53,581
You told me yourself, I had nothing to do with them!

455
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:57,503
Look, Ilya, remember what I told you about the errand? You know, from your mother?

456
00:30:57,503 --> 00:31:02,164
You should say something in a good time and keep quiet in a bad one! Don't interfere!

457
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:06,345
- And don't you dare shout at me! I'm not your saddle mare! - I'll tell you...

458
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:08,531
...say hello to your mother!

459
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:11,303
After all, I am a prince!

460
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:16,567
And what's more, it's his duty to serve the Prince! And he's giving me a hard time!

461
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:22,024
And me... My sleeves are dirty! And I'm a prince! In case he's forgotten...

462
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:39,467
And the Prince and Ilyushka are probably in tears. Ah-ha-ha!

463
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:45,336
"Where's my money! Where's my horse, where's my Burushka!" Ha-ha-ha!

464
00:31:57,093 --> 00:32:00,047
What? Is it hard without a magic mane?

465
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:05,340
Don't you cross the Nightingale, don't you cross the Nightingale! Where's my gold?

466
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:10,950
The Nightingale needs gold... Ouch! With gold the Nightingale will start a new life! Ouch!

467
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:14,604
Zanrani!

468
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:21,105
And I'll sell you to the first man I meet. Understand?

469
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:25,526
Or not? I'll order to make two drums out of your hide!

470
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:30,263
I'll play one myself, and send the other to Ilya!

471
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:43,478
You rebellious, thug! You parasite!

472
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:47,112
I thought I'd do the right thing!

473
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:52,444
A horse for him, a treasury for me, and now here you are! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

474
00:32:53,854 --> 00:32:58,639
Here! My horse, my treasury, my treasury, my horse!

475
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,212
It's all mine!

476
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:06,253
- I don't want to see him! - No, Prince, it's not right. We must catch up with Ilya!

477
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:08,910
- What's that? - My mother told me to give it to Ilya.

478
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,132
- She said that his native land gives him strength. - So what of it?

479
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:14,903
We don't need Ilya the rebel now!

480
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:19,477
You can't do that! And if trouble happens to him?

481
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,229
It serves him right! Eh!

482
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:27,811
Good! How can we beat Nightingale without Ilya? Have you thought about that?

483
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:30,045
How? How...

484
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:33,325
Vasilius! We... will help us.

485
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:37,496
Who can compare to Ilya Muromets? And what kind of a bogatyr is that - "Vasilevs"?

486
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:39,711
Oh, you! Chronicler!

487
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:44,439
The Vasileus is... Emperor.

488
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,706
Byzantine. He's my brother by blood.

489
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:52,303
If I whisper to him, he'll get Nightingale out of the ground for me!

490
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:59,092
While the prince and his companion were reaching the port,

491
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:02,832
...Ilya was halfway across the border...

492
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,654
...to Tsargrad.

493
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,571
And the Bandit Nightingale, celebrating his victory...

494
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,489
...to the great city.

495
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:20,160
Three!

496
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,193
Two!

497
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:38,103
Take it!

498
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,278
It's a good horse, isn't it?

499
00:34:44,355 --> 00:34:47,376
- It's a good horse! No pity? Why don't you play it back? - Hm!

500
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:54,760
I'll buy me a hundred of them! A thousand!

501
00:34:54,827 --> 00:35:00,724
I don't need a horse! For that money the whole of Tsargrad will be mine by today!

502
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,592
Do you know how many there are here?

503
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:15,224
You shaitan scum!

504
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:23,135
Uh, no! That's my horse now!

505
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:25,763
Get out of my way!

506
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:34,931
Well, merchant, let's see if your legs are strong!

507
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:02,311
You're lying, you won't get away with it!

508
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:16,139
Look what I found!

509
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:20,886
- Wow! Look! - Wow! - Wow!

510
00:37:24,147 --> 00:37:26,074
Where did the horse go?

511
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:28,462
Who saw it? Hmm?

512
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:02,419
Well, we're almost there. We'll get on the ship,

513
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:05,842
...and we're done. You got any money?

514
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:09,458
Heh-heh-heh-heh! That's what I said. Why do we need money?

515
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,248
Am I a prince or am I not a prince?

516
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:57,674
Oh, what a beauty, a figure of a vine, a face of a berry!

517
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,807
- Would you like to go to Tsargrad? - What's it to you?

518
00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:05,106
I can help you. And besides, I can offer you a job.

519
00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:08,338
High pay, accommodation, insurance...

520
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:09,652
How so? As what?

521
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:14,638
In show business! Exotic dancing!

522
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:22,952
I can already see it: "Star of Tsargrad!"

523
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,134
No, no, it doesn't fit. Tell me something,

524
00:39:34,134 --> 00:39:38,325
...a tall, handsome man. A bogatyr, in a word!

525
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:42,726
Are you talking about Ilya again?

526
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:45,977
Who are you writing the chronicle about?

527
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:49,055
There are heroes around, and you have a deserter on your mind!

528
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:55,509
We have two tickets to first class. Payment - at the expense of the host party!

529
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:59,278
And serve tea! With baranki!

530
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:09,520
You don't have to write it down in the annals!

531
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,253
I am the prince! I am you!

532
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:15,427
Wait! You'll come to me for a license!

533
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:19,205
Oh, Prince... I am... Wait for me here!

534
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:50,956
And in Constantinople, life went on as usual.

535
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:55,070
The Byzantine emperor, the emperor, was working hard,

536
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:59,357
...thinking night and day about the affairs of state.

537
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:04,084
Well, that's about it. It's beautiful.

538
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,863
Isn't this where the Duchy of Kiev is located?

539
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:12,312
Isn't it? Curious, heh-heh-heh...

540
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,932
So what of it? What are we feeding the army with? А?

541
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:22,151
So... The Great Emperor... Brothers! By faith...

542
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:26,965
Don't you get it? You want to upset the emperor.

543
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:31,913
Where is he? Where is the executioner, I ask you!

544
00:41:31,913 --> 00:41:34,397
It's his day off! The great emperor...

545
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:36,536
Hmm?

546
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:42,031
As they say, I impregnate you! Bye...

547
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:50,920
I'm so tired!

548
00:41:51,265 --> 00:41:58,103
No! Do not ask, do not beg, all to the executioner...

549
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:05,909
I will execute... And pardon...

550
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:17,550
...And so Tsargrad has managed to preserve itself over its more than thousand-year history.

551
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:23,036
Immediately upon arrival we will give you a guided tour, and you will see everything with your own eyes.

552
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:28,463
And now we offer you a taste of fresh tea with baranki.

553
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:53,339
Boorushka!

554
00:43:06,966 --> 00:43:11,415
Boorushka!

555
00:43:39,129 --> 00:43:41,038
Don't you get it?!

556
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:46,264
Who let the horse into the emperor's garden?

557
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:49,611
А?! Hey! Somebody! Bring the executioner here!

558
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:54,079
- It's his day off! - He'll finish it later!

559
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,724
A Roman chariot...

560
00:43:57,724 --> 00:44:02,202
- It's not ours, it's the horse's. - Gold?!

561
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:08,282
Curious...

562
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:11,619
God's grace has descended on your head, great emperor!

563
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:16,097
The magical horse is not just in your hands, but for the deeds of righteousness!

564
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:18,149
Glory to the great emperor!

565
00:44:18,149 --> 00:44:22,062
- Hail! - Well done... Well done!

566
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:29,686
And where... Where, I ask you, is the magic horse?

567
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,786
...mine. А?

568
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:36,207
Missed it... Missed it!

569
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:42,258
- Right! All of you! Move it! Search! My horse! - Ah...

570
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:44,617
- M-m-mo... - Go away, go away!

571
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:49,038
- Hey, somebody get him out of here! - Can't we try it from the air? Ouch!

572
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,205
Curious!

573
00:44:51,598 --> 00:44:54,811
Well done... good boy... Come here!

574
00:44:55,597 --> 00:45:00,209
- Do you know how to parachute? - Mm... ah... э...

575
00:45:04,707 --> 00:45:07,229
Oh... St. John...

576
00:45:08,447 --> 00:45:10,509
All built up... Oh...

577
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:14,632
There's the palace of the emperor. It's so far away.

578
00:45:14,632 --> 00:45:18,228
Let me sit down for a minute, or else... I feel dizzy!

579
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:21,805
Look! How cultured they are here!

580
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:25,047
They even have chairs outside!

581
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:28,729
Oh, it's nice here!

582
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:31,174
Cultured...

583
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:37,503
Cultured, I say! When I come back, I'll have them put chairs like that in Kiev too!

584
00:45:37,503 --> 00:45:39,354
In Kiev!

585
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:41,685
Oh, it's convenient.

586
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:47,947
- And the money? - What money?

587
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:51,399
- Here's to a wonderful rest in my wonderful chair! - What?

588
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:53,269
Are you out of your mind?

589
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:57,344
Here's to sitting on that crappy... stool! You want money?

590
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:02,302
- Quiet, quiet! Better pay, Prince. - Where from?

591
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:05,083
I told you, I don't have any money!

592
00:46:06,071 --> 00:46:09,130
They'll let you go to hell! You're a bad trip...

593
00:46:09,341 --> 00:46:12,266
Silver! Silver, I say!

594
00:46:15,354 --> 00:46:19,228
- A foreign wonder! What kind of a prince is that, eh? - It's a balloon!

595
00:46:19,228 --> 00:46:24,099
- Did you steal a fork from the ship? - No way! This is payment.

596
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:28,386
It's not every day that they have a prince to serve.

597
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:42,291
I don't see anything yet...

598
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:44,688
Nothing...

599
00:46:44,688 --> 00:46:47,412
W-w-w-w-well... There!

600
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:49,943
Well done! Good boy.

601
00:46:57,337 --> 00:47:00,454
Boorushka!

602
00:47:06,265 --> 00:47:12,700
There he is! There he is, my little dove!

603
00:47:13,428 --> 00:47:15,183
And who's that?

604
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:19,336
Who dares to catch my horse?

605
00:47:19,393 --> 00:47:23,613
Seize them all immediately and bring them to me!

606
00:47:23,613 --> 00:47:25,511
I'll have mercy and beheading.

607
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:30,776
Perhaps only execute...

608
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:36,722
Oh, they won't make it in time.

609
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:38,860
I wish he could shorten his way here.

610
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:41,871
Well done! Good for you.

611
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:47,951
Show him a shortcut!

612
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:52,861
Did somebody tell him to pull the ring? А?

613
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:10,592
Open your eyes! I almost didn't let trouble get ahead of me.

614
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:15,579
Thank you! You saved me from the fierce beast.

615
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:20,249
That's right! It wouldn't be a bad thing to say thank you.

616
00:48:20,642 --> 00:48:22,790
Thank you, Grandma!

617
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,105
Thank you!

618
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:30,232
I hear what you're shouting for!

619
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:38,958
They're in a hurry, they're in a hurry... There's no time for thanks.

620
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,239
I don't think we'll make it tonight. It's a long way to the palace.

621
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:58,415
And the emperor has a short working day.

622
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:02,942
I work from dawn to dawn, but emperors, you know...

623
00:49:05,598 --> 00:49:07,890
Here you go!

624
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:22,389
Ooh! That's the kind of animal I'd get.

625
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:24,307
Doesn't bite?

626
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:34,204
Would you like a ride, sir?

627
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:37,953
I know you! You'll t-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o... you'll rip off your underwear!

628
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,917
Ah-ah-ah-ah! No, sir,

629
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:45,970
...you don't have to pay for riding.

630
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,662
- Are you sure? It's free? - I swear on my mother!

631
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:54,141
Prince, he's lying, it's his business!

632
00:49:54,467 --> 00:49:58,744
- And we'll lose time. - That's all right. We'll use it. Get in.

633
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:03,280
I'm not going anywhere! Ilya may need help, but we...

634
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,847
- No, like a child, honestly! - You're talking about Ilya again?

635
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:10,366
That's it, I told you! I'm not interested in him anymore!

636
00:50:10,913 --> 00:50:14,576
Let's go to the emperor! And you stay here, since you're so clever!

637
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:17,309
You think you can defy the prince!

638
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:21,625
- Despot! - I heard everything!

639
00:50:29,248 --> 00:50:34,762
Aaah! A vine with a figure, a berry with a face!

640
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:38,752
- You're still looking for a big man, aren't you? - Why? Do you know where to find him?

641
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,450
Of course I do. Please, my dear!

642
00:50:58,938 --> 00:51:01,162
That's my horse!

643
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:06,466
- Get out of my way! - Ha-ha-ha!

644
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:39,550
What's the matter with you? You want to whistle in here?

645
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:41,736
Don't whistle, I said!

646
00:51:43,107 --> 00:51:44,747
Don't whistle!

647
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:48,852
There'll be no money, it's an omen!

648
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:16,029
Hey! What are you doing here?

649
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:17,975
I'm late for the king.

650
00:52:17,975 --> 00:52:21,619
It's... is a walk... not a cab.

651
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:25,321
All right, that's it! Stop right there, brother! Get me out of here!

652
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:28,140
Harasho. Give me the money.

653
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,087
You swore you wouldn't take money!

654
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:33,990
I don't take money for the ride,

655
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,649
...but for the fact that you...

656
00:52:35,649 --> 00:52:37,711
...to get off the elephant.

657
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:40,578
- Got it, huh? - Oh, you foreign crooks!

658
00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:43,301
Wait, I'll come down!

659
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:47,550
Oh... I'll be right down!

660
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:58,856
Stop! Stop! Stop!

661
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,899
Boorushka!

662
00:53:20,442 --> 00:53:23,645
Where are you, Boorushka!

663
00:53:23,894 --> 00:53:28,421
At least give me a sign, send me word!

664
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:37,799
Burushka!

665
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:46,976
- Prince! Ilya! Ilyushka!

666
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:49,537
Get me out of here!

667
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:01,102
Ilya! My dear knight!

668
00:54:01,102 --> 00:54:03,547
Thank God! We have met!

669
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:19,677
I'm by nature... an easy-going person. Well, you... you know.

670
00:54:20,176 --> 00:54:23,369
I guess we should stick together after all,

671
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:26,591
- because it's a foreign land. What... what do you think? - Hmm!

672
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:30,293
What's that... foreign beast?

673
00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:34,905
Are you still here? Get out of here! You stupid bastard!

674
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:37,418
You're so clumsy, Prince!

675
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:41,196
How can you talk to an animal like that?

676
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:45,109
She, like a human being, likes affection.

677
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:48,484
Oh, you, good, good!

678
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:50,373
We won't hurt you.

679
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:54,296
Where did such a strange animal come from?

680
00:54:55,715 --> 00:54:59,953
They call it business! The damned chaser shrouded me in deceit!

681
00:55:00,136 --> 00:55:04,940
...and said, "Get in! Take this despot for a ride! I don't want any money!"

682
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:09,821
I knew right away what was going on. And he said, "Take a ride, prince, do me a favor!"

683
00:55:09,821 --> 00:55:12,008
You stole my elephant!

684
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:14,856
Ilya Ivanovich! There he is! The damned bandit.

685
00:55:14,856 --> 00:55:18,126
Where's my money? Give me my money!

686
00:55:18,126 --> 00:55:20,015
What money?

687
00:55:21,837 --> 00:55:24,378
Shut up, you stupid brute!

688
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:29,432
He who is weak in spirit, the beast is in disgrace!

689
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,964
Why are you tying the beast?!

690
00:55:31,964 --> 00:55:38,475
I wanted my elephant. I wanted to take my money. He's a crook!

691
00:55:38,475 --> 00:55:42,992
- He's a crook! - I'll show you now!

692
00:55:44,612 --> 00:55:47,077
Leave him alone, Prince!

693
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,402
- Better tell me, where did Alyonushka go?

694
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:56,158
Nobody knows how to use a parachute!

695
00:55:56,158 --> 00:55:58,872
How are we going to live? А?

696
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:05,661
Well, as long as they catch my horse, we'll train. Come on. Get in.

697
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,984
Come on!

698
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:18,924
To the Great Emperor I dare to offer a foreign maiden!

699
00:56:18,924 --> 00:56:22,319
A vine with a figure and a face like a berry!

700
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,672
Wow! Interesting!

701
00:56:27,823 --> 00:56:31,371
By what right was I captured and brought here against my will?

702
00:56:31,371 --> 00:56:32,973
I like it!

703
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:36,962
No, I do! I like it!

704
00:56:36,962 --> 00:56:41,057
Even better... this... the one before that!

705
00:56:41,057 --> 00:56:43,914
Untie me at once! I was coming to you!

706
00:56:43,914 --> 00:56:48,891
You came by yourself? Ah... What's your name?

707
00:56:48,891 --> 00:56:50,944
What's your name? Alyonushka!

708
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:53,677
What a wonderful name!

709
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,218
That's it, Alyonushka,

710
00:56:56,563 --> 00:57:01,214
...let's go to my private office!

711
00:57:01,214 --> 00:57:02,653
Caught!

712
00:57:03,938 --> 00:57:06,191
Caught it, Great Emperor!

713
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:10,574
The parachute has opened after all.

714
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:14,946
Caught your precious horse. They've put him in the stable.

715
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,945
And the bandits who were chasing him?

716
00:57:19,962 --> 00:57:22,436
- Ah... We only caught one! - What do you mean one?

717
00:57:23,404 --> 00:57:26,329
Do you want to upset the emperor? Well...

718
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:31,604
- The hangman to him, my horse to me. Now! - May I see the hangman?

719
00:57:31,604 --> 00:57:36,456
- The hangman? - No! At the horse. I'm very curious.

720
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,377
Come on, prince, don't lag behind!

721
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:47,983
Look! Look! Another Vasilius!

722
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,010
No, he's alive! Honestly!

723
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,412
When we come back, I'll have them put up, too! A dozen of them!

724
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:01,514
- What a beauty! - Let's go, Prince!

725
00:58:01,715 --> 00:58:07,056
I told you, Burushka's running around here somewhere! I feel it in my heart...

726
00:58:07,056 --> 00:58:09,003
Don't worry so much!

727
00:58:09,463 --> 00:58:14,134
He'll help us find the treasury in no time... I mean, save Burushka!

728
00:58:14,134 --> 00:58:18,487
- He's my brother, by blood... - Aha!

729
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:22,064
Well, did you get caught?

730
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,278
Well? Take a bite! Know our people! Aspies.

731
00:58:46,393 --> 00:58:50,737
And you, my dear friend, have not reduced your strength one bit.

732
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:53,173
Why would I reduce it?

733
00:58:53,173 --> 00:58:57,431
Well, what about it? And the Russian land, from which you take strength..,

734
00:58:57,747 --> 00:59:01,219
...it has nothing to do with it? Oh, sly one!

735
00:59:05,783 --> 00:59:09,504
How could I have forgotten!...

736
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,853
Hey! What are you doing? Get up, Ilyushka!

737
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:15,718
Get up! I was joking! About the land!

738
00:59:18,624 --> 00:59:22,527
I'm going to the emperor, Ilyushka, to the emperor! For help...

739
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:47,066
Well, servant, report immediately to the emperor that his old friend, the prince of Kiev, has arrived!

740
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:51,094
Well! Do I have to wait long? Let me through!

741
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:55,898
The Vasilevs! The Vasilevs!

742
00:59:56,253 --> 01:00:00,041
What are you doing, smerds? Let me through!

743
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:05,584
Your Majesty! Vasilius! Vasya! Vasya! Vasilievos!

744
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:15,442
Damned Russian! You didn't want to do it the right way?

745
01:00:15,739 --> 01:00:18,933
Let them pay the ransom for you now!

746
01:00:53,196 --> 01:00:55,843
Thank you, foreign wonder!

747
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,624
I couldn't have done it myself.

748
01:01:01,587 --> 01:01:04,877
Ah... How can I help you?

749
01:01:05,423 --> 01:01:09,518
Well, what a nuisance... Aah!

750
01:01:11,628 --> 01:01:14,687
I've lost all my strength...

751
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,776
Listen!

752
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:26,894
Here's Burushkin's horseshoe! She walked on her native land!

753
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:33,473
Come on, honey, help me out! Come on!

754
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:40,233
Look at that! The strength is really coming back!

755
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:44,760
Come on... Oh!

756
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:47,685
It's coming back!

757
01:01:52,374 --> 01:01:54,359
Hello, girls!

758
01:01:54,695 --> 01:01:58,176
Well, that's how it is!

759
01:02:42,202 --> 01:02:45,606
- Ekem... Biru... - What?

760
01:02:45,922 --> 01:02:49,768
Phew, thank God! Hello, orthodox!

761
01:02:49,835 --> 01:02:53,747
- Who are you? - Huh? A prince!

762
01:03:03,021 --> 01:03:07,892
- Will you have some tea, Prince? - Come here, Prince! - Have a seat!

763
01:03:11,728 --> 01:03:13,828
Hello, servants!

764
01:03:14,231 --> 01:03:18,076
I've come with the Prince of Kiev.

765
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,781
Has he appeared here?

766
01:03:23,293 --> 01:03:28,002
I understand, the service... It's not allowed to talk to outsiders at the post!

767
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:38,521
What's the matter with you guys?

768
01:03:38,713 --> 01:03:40,765
You must have me confused with someone else!

769
01:04:04,643 --> 01:04:06,485
So what's up?

770
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:09,736
Was the prince of Kiev here?

771
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:14,406
So he was! And where did he go?

772
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:21,531
Here you are! Stupid brute,

773
01:04:21,531 --> 01:04:25,779
...but she's more useful than all of you!

774
01:04:44,431 --> 01:04:48,986
I'm curious, how much more does he have inside?

775
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:56,168
May I ask you for an interview? What an unusual story!

776
01:04:56,168 --> 01:04:58,230
I don't have an interview!

777
01:04:58,508 --> 01:05:02,987
- There was a horse, and that one was taken away! His name is Burushka! - What?!

778
01:05:02,987 --> 01:05:04,243
Burushka?

779
01:05:04,243 --> 01:05:07,168
Don't order his execution, O wise emperor!

780
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:11,291
- Don't you understand?  - Your good horse... - What horse?

781
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:15,079
Stop spewing gold!

782
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:55,029
Well, get ready, Prince!

783
01:05:55,758 --> 01:05:58,271
Ah, the dinner has just arrived...

784
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:03,037
- Pasta! - Well done, Ilya, you remembered your prince!

785
01:06:03,056 --> 01:06:05,031
Let's go, shall we?

786
01:06:05,866 --> 01:06:07,592
Do you know what the brothers say?

787
01:06:07,985 --> 01:06:11,063
It's as if they delivered a beautiful horse to the emperor.

788
01:06:11,226 --> 01:06:13,259
They say it's spewing gold!

789
01:06:13,499 --> 01:06:16,414
What nonsense! What gold?

790
01:06:16,414 --> 01:06:19,732
This kind of gold! And along with the horse they also brought a foreign girl.

791
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,561
If it wasn't Alyonushka...

792
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:26,915
And where... Where's my treasury? I'm so worried about the treasury!

793
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:30,799
All right, Prince, don't get excited. We'll sort it out.

794
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:40,369
Why isn't the horse spewing gold anymore?!

795
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:42,038
Answer me!

796
01:06:42,671 --> 01:06:45,154
Have you sent someone to fetch the executioner?

797
01:06:56,432 --> 01:06:57,966
Don't!

798
01:06:57,966 --> 01:07:03,480
And the innocent prisoner told of the intrigues of Ilyushka of Murom.

799
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:09,234
How the heartless villain had robbed him of his honestly earned wealth,

800
01:07:09,272 --> 01:07:11,372
...robbed him to the bone..,

801
01:07:11,555 --> 01:07:14,594
...and hid all his gold...

802
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:17,078
...in his horse...

803
01:07:17,078 --> 01:07:18,996
...magic horse!

804
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:26,351
Great Emperor! The Russians have destroyed the bridge to the palace!

805
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:31,837
- Now, Burushka, now! - Great Emperor! The Russians have destroyed the city prison!

806
01:07:31,837 --> 01:07:34,685
Come on, dear land, help me out!

807
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,951
Great Emperor!

808
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:45,972
The army for the march on Kiev is built!

809
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:50,076
Here you are, Prince, a brother by blood!

810
01:07:50,076 --> 01:07:52,493
There must be some mistake...

811
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:04,873
- Russians, surrender! - Russians do not surrender!

812
01:08:05,717 --> 01:08:08,200
Where are the Russians?

813
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,166
Are these the ones?

814
01:08:10,214 --> 01:08:12,410
You and Business go ahead,

815
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,328
...and I'll cover your rear!

816
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:17,032
Ilya! Where are you going?

817
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:52,974
Ilyusha, hold on!

818
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:02,813
Eh... Not the same power as in Mother Russia!

819
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,215
But it seems to be the same!

820
01:09:42,466 --> 01:09:46,053
Na-shee! Na-shee! Na-shee!

821
01:09:59,497 --> 01:10:02,854
You, Emperor, are no match for the Russian bogatyr!

822
01:10:02,854 --> 01:10:06,105
And you didn't believe me! I wanted to take Kiev!

823
01:10:06,105 --> 01:10:10,180
- We need a special warrior here. - What do you want? What do you want?

824
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,326
Toothmaker! For starters...

825
01:10:13,354 --> 01:10:16,462
Well, that's how it is.

826
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,456
Alyonushka!

827
01:10:18,456 --> 01:10:22,292
Hold on, Ilya! Hold on! Here, Russian land!

828
01:10:24,076 --> 01:10:28,947
Here we are... Now we'll never part!

829
01:10:28,947 --> 01:10:32,035
Ilya... Russian land...

830
01:10:32,035 --> 01:10:35,180
Your mother told me to tell you. Remember?

831
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,824
Thank you... But you're a little late.

832
01:10:51,828 --> 01:10:54,887
The mountain and the mountain don't add up, Ilya!

833
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,527
Don't whistle!

834
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:25,353
I told you, you wretched fool!

835
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:40,908
Where is my treasury! You damned scoundrel!

836
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:44,350
Answer me at once! Before I deal with you myself!

837
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:49,816
Hello! Hello, my brother!

838
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:56,136
Ah... No, really... I didn't recognize you.

839
01:11:56,433 --> 01:11:59,368
As you say, you'll be rich!

840
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:07,739
The king returned the treasury of the prince,

841
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:11,777
...which the prince could not rejoice in for a long time.

842
01:12:11,777 --> 01:12:16,571
And so they walked and rode, and so they reached home,

843
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:19,477
...where honor and honor awaited them..,

844
01:12:19,477 --> 01:12:21,098
...and glory awaited them!

845
01:12:29,776 --> 01:12:32,174
He's back!

846
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,639
And Ilya Muromets regained his former strength and power,

847
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:52,369
...and then Ilya Muromets beat the countless hordes of his enemies,

848
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:54,891
...and grabbed the main villain by the belt..,

849
01:12:54,891 --> 01:13:00,799
...and threw him over the sea! Since then, Ilya Muromets has been honored not only by the Russian people..,

850
01:13:00,799 --> 01:13:04,692
...but also in other foreign countries! And when there's trouble, they call...

851
01:13:04,692 --> 01:13:08,931
...Ilya Muromets immediately! And the people live in peace..,

852
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:11,654
...as long as Ilya Muromets!... All right, that's enough! All right, then,

853
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:17,341
Alyonushka has written well! Fresh and believable. Give me that chronicle!

854
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:21,205
Yes... You, my dear man, here and here...

855
01:13:21,205 --> 01:13:25,693
...in short, everywhere! Replace Ilya Muromets with the Prince of Kiev, and it'll be fine!

856
01:13:26,624 --> 01:13:29,357
Well, that's it!
