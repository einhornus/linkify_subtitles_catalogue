1
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:47,516
- Did you find it? - Yes, madam, this time I have.

2
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:53,332
- And who? - The cobbler's son, Mistress.

3
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,689
And you are sure that he is...

4
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,578
The best, Mistress, the best! There is no one in the whole kingdom...

5
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:04,981
You know what I'll do to you if you deceive me again.

6
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,193
No, Mistress! Not this time, I mean yes!

7
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:18,623
Well, I'll visit him tomorrow.

15
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,092
All right!

16
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,822
Jacob, look what Daddy made me!

17
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,845
Heh! It's great, it's almost like a real one.

18
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,649
Listen up, people of the kingdom!

19
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:59,769
Yesterday the royal daughter, Their Highness Princess Greta, disappeared from the palace.

20
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:04,479
- Poor Princess. - What happened to her?

21
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:11,215
Whoever helps us find her will be rewarded royally!

22
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:23,971
- Mother, the princess is missing! - Yes, Jacob, I heard.

23
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:27,953
- Will they find her? - Of course they will, they will.

24
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,715
- What a helper you have! - I can't complain.

25
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:36,952
Well, run along, helper, your father is waiting for you. And I'll manage on my own.

26
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:52,186
It's a piece of crap, not a product!

27
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:56,674
Crap...

28
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,352
Crap!

29
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:09,390
Why do you say that? It's very fresh...

30
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,163
Ah...

31
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,842
Friend Jacob...

32
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:19,695
If the dear lady would like to buy something...

33
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:22,455
I do, I do. Ha-ha-ha!

34
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:28,086
Here, put five cabbages in my basket.

35
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:35,157
And let your boy take me home.

36
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:39,016
- My father is waiting for me! - Come on, Jacob, don't be lazy!

37
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:42,109
Look how heavy the lady's bag is.

38
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:49,450
Don't be lazy, Jacob, I'll thank you.

39
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:44,859
Do you like it? Come in, Jacob, don't be shy.

40
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,506
Urban, have you prepared everything?

41
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,140
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. Good.

42
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:18,217
Come on, let's go and see how I live.

43
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:25,992
- I promised my mother I'd come right back. - And I promised to thank you.

44
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:30,758
Are you afraid?

45
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:37,264
No, but the house is strange: small on the outside, big on the inside.

46
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:43,601
It's a trick: You see one thing, but it's another.

47
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:56,574
Come on, you need to get some rest.

48
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,090
I can imagine how tired you are of carrying human heads.

49
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:06,073
What heads? I was carrying cabbage!

50
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:18,197
See, that's how you do tricks.

51
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:22,407
All right, get up.

52
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:50,335
Let me out of here at once!

53
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,890
Please...

54
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,639
Now I'm going to show you something amazing.

55
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:20,804
Can you guess who it is?

56
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:32,672
His name is Dougal and he brings... happiness! But first we have to bring him back to life.

57
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,920
Is he dead?

58
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,460
Do you know what happens when good and evil come together?

59
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:58,693
There's a great power in their union, and that power will bring my stone to life!

60
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:05,896
And you will help me do it. Look!

61
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:17,801
Well? Do you want to ride wooden horses all day?

62
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:21,874
No?

63
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:31,074
Ah! Maybe you want a real knight's armor, huh?

64
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:41,535
Do you like it? Well, there you go.

65
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:50,401
I can't give you those presents, but we can exchange them.

66
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,860
- For what? - That's funny to say!

67
00:12:54,625 --> 00:13:01,281
It would be another trick: you just have to put your hand here.

68
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,326
(Urban sneezed.)

69
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:28,272
- I don't want to. - You don't want to? Why not?

70
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:32,450
It's no big deal, come on.

71
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:34,850
No.

72
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:38,996
Don't you have enough toys? Good!

73
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:43,789
You'll get money, lots of money.

74
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:50,065
And your parents aren't rich, think how happy they'll be.

75
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:57,465
Mom says it doesn't matter if a person is poor or rich...

76
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:59,966
It's important that he has a good heart.

77
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:04,429
- A good heart? - Yes, a good heart.

78
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:09,888
A poor man with a good heart...

79
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:19,510
What if he suddenly grows a hump or a nose? Would a good heart help him?

80
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,092
Yes.

81
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:26,083
- You must want to put it to the test! - Me? Why?

82
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:32,647
I'll tell you when you come to me.

83
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,617
And I'll make you do it!

84
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:32,988
Where are my shoes? Your mistress let me go.

85
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,013
No, they're not mine.

86
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:03,254
(church bells tolling)

87
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:31,134
Mother, are you unwell? Are you angry with me?

88
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:34,482
What do you want? Go your way.

89
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:38,089
What's the matter, Mother? Are you angry that I'm late?

90
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:41,707
It's that old woman's fault, she wouldn't let me go.

91
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:46,210
Mother, what's the matter with you? You're the one who sent me with her.

92
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:51,851
Why are you making fun of that poor woman? Her son disappeared seven years ago.

93
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:57,051
How seven years? I just took the old woman the cabbage.

94
00:16:57,802 --> 00:17:05,051
- No, what a rascal, huh? Get out of here! - Mother, don't you recognize me?

95
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,763
It's me, Jacob.

96
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:13,308
- I told you to get out! - Well, why?

97
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:17,116
You hear me, boy, get out of here in a nice way.

98
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:30,767
Well, Mother... Well, look at me!

99
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:40,376
- Jakob was handsome, and this one... - Yes, he should be chased away!

100
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:44,097
- No, look at his nose! - Quiet!

101
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:50,935
Do you really think you're Jacob, son of the greengrocer Hannah?

102
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:24,109
(guards laughing)

103
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,131
What are you... What are you running around for, huh?

104
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:34,546
Yes, you almost killed us with your huge nose!

105
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:40,356
Let's shorten it a little bit. А?

106
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:44,596
Aha! Well, where's the nose?

107
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:55,724
- What do you want, have you come to beg? - No, no, sir!

108
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:59,809
Here... This was Heinz the shoemaker's shop, wasn't it?

109
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:05,220
What kind of a master am I? Heinz died seven years ago.

110
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:24,390
Hey, kid! What do you want? Although... Need a pot?

111
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:21,289
(thunder rumbling)

112
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:47,804
- What took you so long, where have you been hanging around? - Come on, Auntie, I...

113
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:51,260
Don't you dare call me aunt! How many times do I have to tell you?

114
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:54,756
Yes, auntie... Oh! I mean, I mean, madam.

115
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:58,227
Report, you bum. Did you follow him?

116
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:02,286
- Yes, ma'am, we'll have him soon. - Good!

117
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:08,418
Keep watching, don't let him out of your sight.

118
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:15,322
Oh, great Dougal! It's only a matter of time.

119
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:21,723
Soon you'll have the kindest heart you can find.

120
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:25,300
Are you still there?

121
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,084
- Ouch! Princess, Mistress, what should I do? - Do I have to think for you?

122
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:37,737
I should have got rid of her a long time ago. Idiot!

123
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:43,704
Here's a transformation for you.

124
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,953
Turn her into a goose, then sell her to the king's kitchen.

125
00:21:54,439 --> 00:22:02,313
What a laugh when she gets to His Royal Majesty's table!

126
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:39,988
Good morning! Do you need an assistant, sir?

127
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,400
An assistant?

128
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:50,328
I can't take you as my assistant or my pots will burst.

129
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,315
- Ah... From what? - Laughter!

130
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:13,597
Rascal, look what you've done! Go away!

131
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:17,362
Don't let my eyes see you! Get out! Get out at once!

132
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,393
And don't you ever stick your big, ugly nose in here again!

133
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,609
Scoundrel, scoundrel!

134
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:42,927
Ugh, couldn't turn her into something lighter, silly old woman!

135
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:46,332
It's a long way to the palace.

136
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:53,799
Hey, sir! What have you got in the bag?

137
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,561
What have you got... in the bag?

138
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:01,498
Nothing special, just a goose. A goose, actually.

139
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:04,459
- A big one? - A big one.

140
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:06,936
Hmm...

141
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:14,290
- Do you know what happens for stealing? - Why is it for stealing?

142
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,439
Then why do you have a big goose?

143
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,792
Me? I don't have a big one. I have a medium one! I mean, in general...

144
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:23,832
Come on, show me!

145
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:33,509
Yeah, it's a big one.

146
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:41,734
I must arrest you immediately and confiscate the goose... uh... confiscate!

147
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:48,234
Sir, I swear there must be some mistake. It's not my fault!

148
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:54,826
Let me give you one thaler and you don't have to arrest anyone.

149
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,430
- How much? Two! And not a thaler less! - And not a thaler less!

150
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:07,851
Two? It's a hornbeam... Uh... All right, all right, I'll do it.

151
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:31,139
- What are you standing there for? We have to pull. - Pull it!

152
00:25:31,836 --> 00:25:34,116
Who's stealing from me here?

153
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:38,212
I wanted to ask you, sir, do you need an assistant?

154
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:41,302
What? Are you still laughing at me?

155
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:45,662
Hold on! I'll rip your long nose out!

156
00:25:47,503 --> 00:25:51,068
(guards laughing)

157
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:59,922
- Hey, why are you having so much fun? - What? Sorry, we didn't recognize you right away.

158
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:05,282
We didn't! Cackling like hyenas, scaring people.

159
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,203
Excuse me!

160
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:11,475
Look, it's great!

161
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:14,928
- Oh! What are you doing here, huh? - Nosey hunchback!

162
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:18,618
- Oh, what a handsome man! - Wow, you scared me!

163
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:21,935
- After him! - After him! Catch him, he'll get away!

164
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:34,611
Can we go now, Mr. Chief Speedwalker?

165
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,529
- Yes, go. - Fatty, follow me.

166
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:44,006
Wait! What's in the bag?

167
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:49,324
In the sack? What sack? Oh, in the bag...

168
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:51,063
Nothing.

169
00:26:51,498 --> 00:26:55,536
What do you mean, nothing? Then why are you carrying it?

170
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:09,058
Do you know what happens for stealing?

171
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:12,128
That's... why theft?

172
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:17,118
Also, I will confiscate the bird and turn you over to the chief of guards.

173
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:23,338
Uh... Well... Sir, don't! Let us give you two thalers.

174
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,805
- What? Five, five thalers!

175
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:29,116
Ten! And not a thaler less!

176
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:38,166
I only have five, give me five more.

177
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:51,091
Oh, I'm hurt! It's all your fault, you scoundrels!

178
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:54,638
Sir, you'll have to get a lotion!

179
00:27:55,201 --> 00:28:00,276
A lotion? Yes, yes, a lotion. Pampusha, I'm hurt!

180
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:04,587
- It's all because of you! - Why is it my fault?

181
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:09,119
- Please, somebody help me! - Because you're a jackass, that's why!

182
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,690
Calling me names.

183
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,740
- Help me, please. - Are you talking to me?

184
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:21,255
Look, she's getting all dolled up.

185
00:28:22,823 --> 00:28:25,046
Hey, she's about to run away!

186
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:31,962
Hey, why are you throwing?

187
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:33,755
I'm not throwing anything.

188
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:37,082
Well, then catch her! What are you standing there? Look, she's getting closer to the fence!

189
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:46,128
Oh, you, are you? Well, wait for me!

190
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,153
Is that you again? Come on, drop the goose!

191
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,060
- Drop it! Surround him!

192
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:23,354
What's that noise over there? Wait for me. Don't move around, sit still!

193
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,557
Don't drip on the carpet, or you'll get it from me!

194
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:30,603
Monster!

195
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,617
What? What did you call me?

196
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,602
- No, you didn't, pumppuppuppuppu! - What?

197
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,306
- You're not the monster. - Oh, I'm not?

198
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:45,558
Oh, your vase!

199
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,045
What are you doing?

200
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:54,735
That's, that's who's to blame! Mr. Blum, quick!

201
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:59,315
Get him, get him!

202
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:30,816
Hurry up! Come on, hurry up!

203
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:00,061
Wait! Wait!

204
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:05,633
Shoes come to your senses! Stop it! Come on, stop it!

205
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,847
Tr-r-r-r!

206
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:15,512
But! Come on! What are you looking at?

207
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:20,599
Damned boys, running around like mad, only scaring the cattle.

208
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:31,327
Wow... Magic shoes, no way.

209
00:31:33,337 --> 00:31:34,797
Hurry up!

210
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:38,106
Wait, wait, t-r-r-r-r!

211
00:31:38,828 --> 00:31:42,118
Tricks! The old woman showed you magic tricks? She did.

212
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:45,474
Could she have mistakenly made me...

213
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:50,441
Yes, of course she could! I can't believe I didn't think of it before.

214
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:54,315
What if it wasn't a trick? All right, we'll figure it out.

215
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:59,534
Oh, and the shoes need to be returned. She's probably looking for them and thinking, "Stolen!"

216
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,287
Here she comes, madam! Here she comes, here she comes.

217
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:04,694
You'll be smiling later, get the key to the mirror room.

218
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:33,940
He's here, madam.

219
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:42,389
Oh, finally!

220
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,691
What's that?

221
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:02,456
Nothing, Auntie! A mouse must have run by.

222
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:03,968
A mouse?

223
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,175
The key, where's the key?

224
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:37,871
- Jacob, run quickly! - Hold them off until I find the key!

225
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:54,657
- Run, run faster! - Damn, it's the same place again!

226
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:57,081
Wow!

227
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:01,593
Give it to me, Mr. Dwarf. It's a good thing you caught her.

228
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:06,250
- We have to run. - Don't listen to her, come on!

229
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:11,707
Mr. Midget, that's enough. Mrs. Stewart...

230
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:15,479
- Mr. Midget... - Please...

231
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:18,052
- Please... - Run!

232
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,008
Aaah!

233
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:29,634
Ouch...

234
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:40,163
Shoes, stop! T-r-r-r-r! We barely made it!

235
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:45,796
We need a place to wait out the rain. Let's go that way.

236
00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:53,218
You're nothing! I'll beat you to a pulp!

237
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:57,407
- I'm sorry... My bad... - Idiot!

238
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:02,172
You ruined everything. I had the boy in my hands.

239
00:36:02,776 --> 00:36:07,696
- Who could have known that a girl would get involved? - You should have known!

240
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:13,040
She belongs in the oven, but now there's two of them, and they're up to something.

241
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:21,360
Find them, find out what they're up to. And remember, you have to make it right!

242
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:31,313
Did anyone ask you to do that? Why are you meddling in your own business?

243
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,220
I didn't meddle in anything.

244
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:36,740
- Well, not at all. Does it hurt? - It hurts.

245
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:38,862
Now, wait!

246
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:48,781
It'll go away in a couple of days.

247
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,530
Thank you. Who taught you that?

248
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,593
My mother knows herbs very well.

249
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:58,315
Then your mother should say thank you, too.

250
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,370
- I'll never see her again. - You won't?

251
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:05,961
Maybe I will, but she won't recognize me anyway.

252
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:12,594
Oh, so that's why you went back to the old woman! Did you think she'd magic you up?

253
00:37:13,183 --> 00:37:16,877
Of course, you had to touch a stone, didn't you?

254
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:20,832
The old woman was doing tricks. And so... - Tricks?

255
00:37:21,295 --> 00:37:26,401
Do you want me to tell you what kind of tricks they are? Well, listen.

256
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:30,662
Many, many years ago, a dying monk...

257
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:36,174
...asked the king to hide a book and never take it out of the palace.

258
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:39,396
And more recently...

259
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,220
I think it's in here somewhere.

260
00:37:52,076 --> 00:37:53,426
Aha!

261
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:02,440
His name is Jacob. Jacob is the cobbler's son.

262
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:10,358
- Why are you laughing? - Who are you, sweet child?

263
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:14,387
Я? A princess! Why did you take Daddy's book?

264
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:18,327
He won't let anyone take it. Not even me.

265
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:23,282
But you wouldn't tell him that, would you?

266
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,070
I can't lie to my daddy.

267
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:33,597
And you don't have to lie to him. Just don't say anything, that's all.

268
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:40,011
- Your Highness, Princess! - Look me in the eye.

269
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,170
- We're looking for Her Highness, and... - Her Highness?

270
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:55,418
Yes. What are you doing here?

271
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,710
- So you're a princess? - I was a princess.

272
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:11,712
Until that nasty guy I baited came along.

273
00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:15,307
That's how I found out it's been seven years.

274
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:18,021
- And you have seven years? - Yeah.

275
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:24,112
And then he said I'd make a great roast and turned me into a goose.

276
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:27,656
Well, wait, we'll show you!

277
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,011
Look, I know what to do.

278
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:37,559
What?

279
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:42,662
We have to read this book, I have to look at the palace.

280
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:44,094
What for?

281
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:46,242
We'll figure out a way to get in at night.

282
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,328
No, Jacob, please, you'll get caught!

283
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:52,701
I'm not going anywhere, I'm just going to look, that's all.

284
00:39:53,472 --> 00:39:56,422
And you... Do you want to hang out with the son of a shoemaker?

285
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,460
Silly, of course I do.

286
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:02,154
And what shall I call you? Your Highness?

287
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:06,647
What "Highness"? Just call me Greta.

288
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:08,610
Greta...

289
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:21,465
Your Highness, we've searched the entire kingdom seven times in seven years.

290
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:23,654
For seven years...

291
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,229
Your Majesty, they say there's a lot of witchcraft going on here.

292
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,161
I don't think anyone would do such a thing, Your Majesty!

293
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,639
Witchcraft is punishable by death!

294
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,525
Then where is my daughter?

295
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:39,799
Your Majesty! The foot soldiers have gone astray. We're short of men.

296
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,970
Look for new ones!

297
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:15,868
In the name of His Royal Majesty, tomorrow a race is announced for runners.

298
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:21,580
The winner will be inducted into the royal service of speed walkers!

299
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,575
- Where are they? - In the old mill, ma'am.

300
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,950
What are you doing here? Go there at once!

301
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,846
I must know what they're talking about, every word they say!

302
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,898
- But it's night, madam. - Are you afraid of the dark?

303
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:50,582
Yes! I mean, no, mistress!

304
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,937
But may I take the spirit of transformation with me?

305
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,320
I have few of them left myself.

306
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:00,787
Go on, I don't want to hear any more.

307
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:59,209
- Who's there? - Don't you recognize your king, soldier?

308
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,048
Of course I do, Your Majesty.

309
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:06,744
It's just that they say it's turbulent here, Your Majesty.

310
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:13,486
- What do you mean, "uneasy"? - Well, there are spirits, ghosts...

311
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,710
Talking. You, lad, don't be so concerned with all this nonsense.

312
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:23,258
Yes, Your Majesty!

313
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:31,295
There, there, look, there's another one flying!

314
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:34,885
We had a big pipe on the roof.

315
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:36,621
A pipe?

316
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:40,136
Yes, a pipe, only with glass, and you could look into it.

317
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,490
- Why would you look in it? - Just for fun.

318
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:48,313
It magnified everything, my dad and I even looked at the moon.

319
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,005
That's great!

320
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:53,551
And me and the boys used to tease the guards by throwing acorns at them.

321
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:55,356
It was funny, too!

322
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:57,201
- Funny? - Well, yes.

323
00:43:57,657 --> 00:44:02,044
Ouch! Damn dwarf! Well, wait, I'll show you again.

324
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:08,424
- Did the girls play with you? - Girls? No! Well, maybe sometimes.

325
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,776
If a girl had red hair, would you tease her?

326
00:44:13,895 --> 00:44:15,285
No, I wouldn't!

327
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:18,341
I didn't tease anybody, just the guards.

328
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,070
Why do you ask?

329
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,520
No reason.

330
00:44:21,955 --> 00:44:25,745
Would you want to be friends with a girl with red hair?

331
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:31,856
I don't know, if she's interesting, yes. But who would be friends with me?

332
00:44:35,596 --> 00:44:39,030
Who would be friends with me? Who needs me now?

333
00:44:41,537 --> 00:44:46,929
Come on, Greta, I need you. In fact, I'm sure you're very beautiful.

334
00:44:47,587 --> 00:44:48,767
What makes you say that?

335
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:52,245
Because you're a princess, and princesses are always beautiful.

336
00:44:52,707 --> 00:44:56,509
- Have you seen many princesses? - No, not many... You're the first.

337
00:44:57,098 --> 00:45:01,633
And you're a goose, too. In fact, I have red hair.

338
00:45:02,097 --> 00:45:06,036
That's great! So now I'm friends with the girl with red hair.

339
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,890
Ouch!

340
00:45:18,497 --> 00:45:21,537
What if something goes wrong tomorrow? You know how worried I am.

341
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:27,307
- Don't worry, you'll do great. - I'm not scared, I'm just worried.

342
00:45:27,915 --> 00:45:28,959
Oh...

343
00:45:29,998 --> 00:45:31,456
Tell me more about the moon.

344
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:34,097
Did you look at it a lot?

345
00:45:34,504 --> 00:45:40,451
Yes, we wanted to see people. Daddy said people live there, too.

346
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,550
Wow!

347
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:52,654
And these people on the moon, what do they look like? Have you ever seen them?

348
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:56,120
No. Maybe they were sleeping. What do you think?

349
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,079
They must have been asleep, because you have to look at them during the day, and there's no moon during the day.

350
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,897
Oh, yes...

351
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:15,914
Stupid old woman! You should have jumped around with the frogs, then you'd have known.

352
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:21,202
What if they also have such pipes, and they're looking at us now?

353
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:24,265
Sure they do, but we're all asleep, too.

354
00:46:24,729 --> 00:46:27,969
But we are not asleep! Why don't we wave our hands at them?

355
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:30,299
Let's do it!

356
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:34,299

Dear Sir, how can I find Mr. Chief Speedwalker?

368
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,402
- What do you need him for? - I want to compete in the runners' competition.

369
00:48:59,923 --> 00:49:03,423
- Yeah, runners. - Buddy, are you even...

370
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:05,558
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!

371
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:14,017
Mr. Speed Runner on duty! Here comes another one, running faster than the wind.

372
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:21,577
- Let him in, they said to let everyone in. - Thank you very much, gentlemen of the guards.

373
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:27,922
Well, they also said all sorts of nonsense. About the moon...

374
00:49:30,398 --> 00:49:36,218
They wanted the book, they went too far.

375
00:49:37,018 --> 00:49:39,111
Listen, what we need to do...

376
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,220
In the name of His Royal Majesty...

377
00:49:58,023 --> 00:50:04,002
...I ask the runners to prepare for the start of the race!

378
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:07,174
(crowd cheering)

379
00:50:28,212 --> 00:50:31,273
Your Majesty, everything is ready. Shall I begin?

380
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,903
Yes, Mr. Blum, you may begin.

381
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,898
But first I'd like to know why you're wearing a ceremonial uniform.

382
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,040
Were you preparing for a ball?

383
00:50:40,494 --> 00:50:44,691
Your Majesty, do you want me to run away too?

384
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,861
Not just run, Mr. Blum.

385
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:52,344
The chief speed walker must be the fastest. Isn't that right?

386
00:50:52,826 --> 00:50:54,820
That's right, Your Majesty.

387
00:51:03,174 --> 00:51:04,591
On your mark...

388
00:51:08,187 --> 00:51:09,627
Ready...

389
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:13,779
March!

390
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,517
Hurry up!

391
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,961
What a wretch!

392
00:52:15,746 --> 00:52:18,883
Madam! The boy... He was bringing you the cabbage! Do you remember?

393
00:52:19,507 --> 00:52:22,572
The boy... Madam! Madam...

394
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,510
Please.

395
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,430
- What is your name, runner? - Jacob, Your Majesty.

396
00:53:16,219 --> 00:53:21,249
You're a fast runner, Jacob. It's been a long time since anyone has pleased me like that.

397
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:25,706
Your Majesty! He has magic shoes. I saw everything!

398
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,528
Is that so?

399
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,731
Your Majesty! Let Mr. Blum demonstrate their magic properties.

400
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,906
Mr. Blum, don't bore us.

401
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:52,275
If the shoes are magic, you don't need any squatting.

402
00:53:54,077 --> 00:53:55,497
Let's go!

403
00:53:59,007 --> 00:54:01,791
Run! Quickly!

404
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:07,000
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

405
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,422
Trot! Quickly!

406
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:16,456
- Quickly! - Quickly...

407
00:54:20,596 --> 00:54:25,468
Enough, Mr. Blum. The test is over.

408
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:33,784
Well, do you want to be my chief speed walker, Jacob?

409
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:38,493
- I do, Your Majesty. Only... - Only what?

410
00:54:38,856 --> 00:54:42,129
- Just a request, Your Majesty. - Speak.

411
00:54:42,504 --> 00:54:47,104
I would like to employ, Your Majesty, my goose.

412
00:54:48,804 --> 00:54:53,817
A goose? And how will she serve me?

413
00:54:54,682 --> 00:54:56,862
She won't, she'll just live with me.

414
00:54:57,553 --> 00:55:01,433
Very well, Jacob. You've been hired as head footman.

415
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:06,775
And soon you will have a very important assignment.

416
00:55:14,007 --> 00:55:16,507
Wow, wow!

417
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:23,922
That's great!

418
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:28,966
Yes... But when we're done...

419
00:55:29,656 --> 00:55:31,496
What "when we're done"?

420
00:55:32,089 --> 00:55:34,462
Nothing. You'll be a princess again...

421
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:37,839
...and you'll still be my friend. You are my friend, aren't you?

422
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:42,377
You know, I've never had a friend like you.

423
00:55:46,434 --> 00:55:47,954
Do you want me to show you the palace?

424
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:50,689
No, Greta, come on! What if someone sees us?

425
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,671
So what? You're the king's chief footman! Don't you remember?

426
00:55:55,198 --> 00:55:58,188
Come, I'll show you my chambers.

427
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,250
- What's this? - This is my and Daddy's favorite game.

428
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:14,669
We used to go in here and lock ourselves in, so no one would find us.

429
00:56:15,118 --> 00:56:19,908
And Daddy would always say, "Well, ponytail, show me how nimble you are."

430
00:56:20,518 --> 00:56:21,658
Why the ponytail?

431
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:24,667
Well, when I was little, I always followed his tail.

432
00:56:25,107 --> 00:56:29,057
That's why he called me "ponytail." It was our secret.

433
00:56:39,323 --> 00:56:43,399
This is my great-grandfather, a very formidable king.

434
00:56:46,622 --> 00:56:47,713
And this...

435
00:56:48,192 --> 00:56:49,822
And this is you?

436
00:56:50,727 --> 00:56:54,317
Mr. Chief Speedwalker, are you touring my palace?

437
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:57,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

438
00:56:58,483 --> 00:57:01,433
Is this your goose, Jacob?

439
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:06,976
Strange, but she reminds me of someone.

440
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:12,398
Jacob, can your goose cry?

441
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:15,683
Your Majesty, this is your...

442
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:21,127
This is your... Mmm... illumination! The smoke makes her eyes water.

443
00:57:21,683 --> 00:57:25,023
Ah! I'll need you tomorrow morning.

444
00:57:28,274 --> 00:57:31,704
- Oh! I almost gave us away. - Oh, I'm good too!

445
00:57:32,377 --> 00:57:36,097
Listen, Greta, shouldn't we tell your father?

446
00:57:36,464 --> 00:57:41,034
Jacob, remember your mother. Did she believe you? What about me?

447
00:57:41,903 --> 00:57:45,784
I can only talk to you, no one else can understand me.

448
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,449
Yes, but I don't feel comfortable.

449
00:57:49,108 --> 00:57:52,908
Your father's been so good to me, and we're stealing a book he treasures.

450
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:56,421
No, we're not stealing it. We're borrowing it.

451
00:57:56,917 --> 00:58:00,917
I'm sure my father won't be the slightest bit angry when he finds out the truth.

452
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:05,273
You think so? I don't think he will if we can make it work.

453
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:08,498
Well, of course we're going to make it!

454
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:45,457
(guard's footsteps can be heard)

455
00:58:51,992 --> 00:58:53,792
Who's there?

456
00:59:11,127 --> 00:59:17,849
I am the angel of death! Why have you disturbed my peace?

457
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,437
They found the book.

458
00:59:38,251 --> 00:59:41,671
It's you, it's all your fault.

459
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:57,416
Madam, will you let me catch the damned dwarf?

460
00:59:57,837 --> 01:00:00,727
We'll put him in our cave of horrors and let him jump!

461
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,522
I'm a little scared there myself.

462
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,680
А?

463
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,510
Huh?

464
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:14,805
You're an idiot, Urban, yes... You're a moron! You can't be trusted with anything.

465
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:21,461
You're nothing but trouble. What should I do with you?

466
01:00:23,154 --> 01:00:28,479
- What should I do? - Pack up, donkey, we're going to the palace!

467
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,880
"I," he says, "am the angel of death!"

468
01:00:37,222 --> 01:00:38,912
- Uh... - Uh...

469
01:00:46,564 --> 01:00:50,364
- "...take who tears the taraxacum..." - Taraxacum?

470
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:56,070
Yes. "...and burn his head with the sun, and scatter his ashes in the wind...

471
01:00:56,788 --> 01:01:00,759
...He shall break the evil spell and bring it all back."

472
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:05,334
I don't get it: do we have to burn someone?

473
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:10,306
No, no, I think that... You see, it says "break it."

474
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:14,171
I think we're talking about some kind of plant.

475
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:19,105
That's right! "Taraxacum" - is some kind of herb.

476
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:23,264
You know what we're going to do? I'm going to go to my mother right now.

477
01:01:23,796 --> 01:01:25,484
She'll help us!

478
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,371
Wait, what does "burn his head with the sun" mean?

479
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:36,733
Maybe if it's a plant, it should be dried in the sun?

480
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:41,266
No, that's different. It says exactly "burn it."

481
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:46,367
And then the ashes have to be scattered. Shall we read some more?

482
01:01:46,827 --> 01:01:51,587
No, we can't waste time. You keep reading while I run to my mother.

483
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:07,499
"And only Jacob shall touch the stone, as Dougal shall have his heart.

484
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:14,229
And evil will be united with good: Dagal will come to life, and there will be no one more ruthless in the world.

485
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:20,492
And Dagal will do her evil will as many times as she wishes."

486
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:29,157
- Greta, the shoes are gone! - My shoes?

487
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:32,457
Oh, what happened to your voice? Are you sick?

488
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:35,989
No, I just got a little hoarse from the excitement, that's all.

489
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:38,787
Who wanted them?

490
01:02:39,337 --> 01:02:42,347
I don't know, it's getting light, and the king is about to call me.

491
01:02:42,851 --> 01:02:44,421
And without them I won't have time to run to my mother.

492
01:02:44,874 --> 01:02:46,114
You don't have to, Jacob!

493
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:51,667
I read in the book that if you touch the stone, everything will be fine.

494
01:02:52,572 --> 01:02:55,482
It's our own fault, we're imagining fears of our own!

495
01:02:56,342 --> 01:02:59,246
We've got to get to her, she'll help us.

496
01:03:00,086 --> 01:03:02,276
How is that possible? Is that written in a book?

497
01:03:02,622 --> 01:03:03,572
Yes!

498
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:07,404
Maybe there's something you don't understand. Let's see it again!

499
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:16,365
Mr. Chief Shifter, His Majesty demands to see you.

500
01:03:25,244 --> 01:03:29,724
- I don't believe it. Get out! - What, auntie, you don't believe me?

501
01:03:31,762 --> 01:03:33,089
Come here!

502
01:03:43,048 --> 01:03:48,395
Mind you, the last transformation. Don't get anything wrong!

503
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:07,885
What are you doing, you idiot? Don't you know how to walk?

504
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:14,431
- It's so dark in here, auntie. - Come on, dummy, it's dark for him.

505
01:04:23,508 --> 01:04:25,271
Hey, pick me up.

506
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:33,619
You're the one I want.

507
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,275
Who are you?

508
01:04:37,531 --> 01:04:41,361
Я? I'm your friend. The magic knight! Come closer.

509
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:48,653
A magic book is missing, run, report to your superiors and you'll be rewarded.

510
01:04:49,063 --> 01:04:52,263
The book... ah... It's gone... Wow!

511
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,280
Stop, donkey! I didn't tell you who stole it!

512
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:02,382
- I'm glad to have you in my service, Jacob. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

513
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:08,396
Now you have your first and very important task.

514
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:12,811
I have a story to tell you.

515
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:23,766
Seven years ago, my daughter disappeared, and you must go in search of her.

516
01:05:24,459 --> 01:05:25,999
Yes, Your Majesty.

517
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,370
What?

518
01:05:29,032 --> 01:05:34,287
A magic book was stolen from the library. There are thieves in the palace! Where is the chief of guards?

519
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,531
Here, Your Majesty!

520
01:05:36,985 --> 01:05:38,865
- Who was on guard? - There he is, Your Majesty!

521
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:42,389
He's telling everyone about some angel of death!

522
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,019
- What? Yes, Your Majesty.

523
01:05:45,576 --> 01:05:48,966
Ah, it's you again? What happened?

524
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:52,737
I was standing on my watch, Your Majesty, standing there...

525
01:05:53,214 --> 01:05:59,775
Suddenly, out of the blue, the angel of death appeared right in front of me.

526
01:06:00,732 --> 01:06:04,102
Yes! "I am," he said, "the angel of death!"

527
01:06:05,025 --> 01:06:08,585
And then the magic knight told me to report everything, so I did.

528
01:06:09,156 --> 01:06:12,126
That's enough, get him out of my sight!

529
01:06:17,335 --> 01:06:21,933
There he is, the angel of death! Only without wings for some reason.

530
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:25,764
Now, either this soldier's gone mad, or...

531
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,376
Search the room of the head speeder immediately!

532
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:39,508
Well, elephant boy, think again, maybe "faster"?

533
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:43,207
I don't remember, maybe "faster."

534
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:46,546
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

535
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:57,821
- Oh, elephant boy, well done! - I don't know how to stop them!

536
01:07:00,018 --> 01:07:03,006
- Oh, oh! Oh... - Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

537
01:07:04,698 --> 01:07:08,155
- Ah-ah-ah-ah! Oh! Ohh! - Uh-uh-uh-uh...

538
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:16,480
So, the angel of death... So it was you who took the book?

539
01:07:17,214 --> 01:07:19,034
- Your Majesty... - Did you or did you not?

540
01:07:19,529 --> 01:07:22,538
- Yes, Your Majesty, but... - No buts!

541
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:27,002
In my kingdom, witchcraft is punishable by death.

542
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:28,872
And you're also a thief!

543
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:31,359
Your Majesty, I can explain!

544
01:07:31,786 --> 01:07:34,146
It's too late to explain, tomorrow you'll have your head cut off.

545
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:37,523
Take him to the tower! The goose to the kitchen, to the cooks!

546
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:43,004
No, Your Majesty! It's your daughter!

547
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:47,021
You still dare to make fun of my grief?

548
01:07:48,377 --> 01:07:51,197
Despicable man...

549
01:07:53,347 --> 01:07:55,057
Take him away!

550
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,181
(goose squeaks)

551
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:11,149
Mr. Dwarf, Mr. Dwarf!

552
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:19,088
Mr. Dwarf! Oh, Mr. Midget! I beg you, tell me, how do they stop?

553
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:22,987
I will spare nothing for you, I will do everything for you!

554
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:25,539
What can you do?

555
01:08:26,247 --> 01:08:27,912
Mr. Dwarf!

556
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:35,334
(note): "Find out from Mrs. Ganna, who sells herbs in the market, what kind of herb is it?"

557
01:08:35,864 --> 01:08:39,881
Taka, caka... And you... you wouldn't cheat?

558
01:08:40,476 --> 01:08:42,734
No, run away!

559
01:08:45,756 --> 01:08:50,806
Jacob, Jacob, you stubborn little man! Do you want to die, you fool?

560
01:08:51,937 --> 01:08:57,391
Do you know how it ends? Your girlfriend's feathers will be blown away by the wind.

561
01:08:57,989 --> 01:09:01,038
And your ugly head will fall into the hangman's sack!

562
01:09:01,444 --> 01:09:05,874
Remember, Jacob, all you have to do is whisper, "I do!"

563
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:08,840
And you'll get it all back.

564
01:09:10,169 --> 01:09:11,169
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

565
01:09:11,984 --> 01:09:17,896
And no one, no one can help you but me!

566
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,768
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

567
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:32,612
Help me, please! Tell me, what is this weed, huh?

568
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:36,339
- Why do you need it, who sent you? - Oh, don't ask!

569
01:09:36,954 --> 01:09:39,584
The hunchback dwarf sent me. He's going to be executed today.

570
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:41,155
Executed?

571
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:50,698
Mr. Dwarf, I found out everything!

572
01:10:06,427 --> 01:10:07,612
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

573
01:10:11,962 --> 01:10:13,323
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

574
01:10:14,953 --> 01:10:18,987
Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow! Uh-uh-uh!

575
01:10:21,701 --> 01:10:24,961
Don't you ever pry into other people's secrets again!

576
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:26,995
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

577
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:33,666
I'm waiting for you, Jacob. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

578
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:05,752
His Royal Majesty ordered the beheading for witchcraft...

579
01:11:06,669 --> 01:11:09,639
...to Jacob, the former head speedster.

580
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,855
Oh, look, she's crying!

581
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:25,518
You are a sorcerer and a thief, besides, you tried to get away with it.

582
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:31,811
In spite of that, you have one last wish. Speak.

583
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:34,420
Speak, speak!

584
01:11:34,937 --> 01:11:38,647
The condemned man's last wish!

585
01:11:48,622 --> 01:11:50,242
Sir!

586
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:57,149
You wanted to know about the herb taraxacum? It's the dandelion.

587
01:12:05,107 --> 01:12:07,957
I think I understand... I got it!

588
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:11,817
Your Majesty! Tail, remember the tail!

589
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:15,947
Tail? How, how did you know that?

590
01:12:16,353 --> 01:12:19,043
Your Majesty, we do not have much time. Believe me, please!

591
01:12:19,472 --> 01:12:21,541
Let me do something. Right here, now.

592
01:12:21,948 --> 01:12:24,708
First you must tell me, from whom did you learn it?

593
01:12:25,293 --> 01:12:30,199
Your Majesty, my words will not convince you. You must see it with your own eyes.

594
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,480
You have touched my heart with doubt. What do you wish to do?

595
01:12:35,009 --> 01:12:38,492
I dare ask the Lord Obergofmeister for his monocle.

596
01:12:38,935 --> 01:12:40,120
A monocle?

597
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:46,266
Your Majesty, I dare say it's a great impudence!

598
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,814
It can't be!

599
01:13:40,074 --> 01:13:42,694
- Jacob, my son! - Mother!

600
01:13:57,528 --> 01:13:59,600
- Jacob, Jacob! - Greta!

601
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:02,967
- Greta... - Greta!

602
01:14:26,997 --> 01:14:30,817
No, Jacob, don't touch it! It's Dougal, I know! I know.

603
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:35,840
Don't listen to her! You don't want her to die, do you?

604
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:47,015
You're wasting your time, Jacob.

605
01:15:19,505 --> 01:15:21,385
My good subjects!

606
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:30,012
This young man brought my daughter back, and saved us all from the terrible, evil sorceress!

607
01:15:30,669 --> 01:15:33,028
(people cheering)

608
01:15:35,515 --> 01:15:39,445
Your Majesty, we did it together with Her Highness.

609
01:15:40,099 --> 01:15:43,670
My name is Greta, have you forgotten?

610
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,680
Save yourselves, Your Majesty!

611
01:15:49,085 --> 01:15:52,585
It's the magic knight. Stand back, I'll hold him off!

612
01:15:56,478 --> 01:15:59,434
Mr. Dwarf, I never approved of my aunt!

613
01:16:00,999 --> 01:16:03,945
I've always... I've always been on your side.

614
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,785
She made me do it! And it was so dark...

615
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:16,718
(all laughing)

616
01:16:49,657 --> 01:16:54,289
- Pampusha, why don't you do it? - No, elephant, I want to do it myself.

617
01:16:54,891 --> 01:16:56,237
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! Ow! Ow, ow!
