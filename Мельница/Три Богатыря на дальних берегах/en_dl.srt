1
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:30,639
Hut, hut, stand back to the forest and front to me.

2
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,710
О!

3
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,522
Kolyvan!

4
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:54,876
I recognized you, Mother. Will you invite me in, or what?

5
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:56,795
Come in, if you're here.

6
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:05,935
I'll join you for a couple of days. Do you mind?

7
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:10,472
Actually, my sister and her husband are coming to visit me.

8
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:11,949
What do you got there?

9
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,100
Oh, hold on.

10
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,761
Here, a present for you.

11
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,706
I'm thinking of setting up a shop.

12
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:23,967
Your merchandise is... so-so.

13
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:25,761
Average merchandise!

14
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,271
It's rubbish, in a word.

15
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:33,750
Even so. But it's not just any product, it's European.

16
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,669
Straight from China itself.

17
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,054
Such goods will be ripped off with their hands and feet.

18
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:42,315
Yes... Well, if they recognize you. Aren't you afraid..,

19
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:45,260
that the prince will take your head off for your past deeds.

20
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:48,396
He will, you say?

21
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:51,523
And so?

22
00:02:56,837 --> 00:03:01,182
Well, pure Basurman. It's like a von baron.

23
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:02,908
That's it.

24
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:25,736
and Lyubava says: "Go," she says, "learn Latin."

25
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,846
What do you think?

26
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:28,930
It's strong.

27
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:32,900
That's a tough wife you've got.

28
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,301
Ilya, I'm here for you!

29
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:40,765
And before that, she was pestering me with Ancient Greek.

30
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,300
What?

31
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,837
Well, yes! He says it's a shame not to know languages nowadays.

32
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:49,139
Go and learn it, she says.

33
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:52,850
Well, Alyosha! Have you learned it?

34
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:54,634
No, I haven't. Not very much.

35
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:58,922
I'm thinking, maybe I'll take Yulia as a tutor.

36
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,976
Yulia's a great teacher.

37
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:06,911
That's what Lyubava says.

38
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:12,033
Yeah, there aren't many of them.

39
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,951
Are you in cahoots with her?

40
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,788
Lyubava said even worse things about Julius.

41
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,859
I'm the only one who stops her from talking.

42
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:33,384
That's it, brothers, coven.

43
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:37,796
That's it! Give it up!

44
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,249
We've lost again.

45
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,234
How are we going to live?

46
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:47,262
I'll tell you how. Now he'll promise you eternal peace.

47
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,181
And in the fall he'll attack again.

48
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,125
Sorry, Dobrynyushka, Ilya's telling the truth.

49
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,235
I can't help it.

50
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,086
I understand.

51
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:00,182
So, until the fall, then?

52
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:02,100
Till autumn.

53
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:30,299
It's a mess. Such a heavy load. How do you manage? I can't imagine.

54
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:33,809
By the way, I'm just finishing my report on gender equality.

55
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:36,562
Would you like to hear the main points?

56
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:38,480
We could have a good time.

57
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,207
We could, for instance, spend the evening at my place.

58
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,633
Souvenirs from Europe! Come on!

59
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:46,029
Oh, souvenirs, you hear, souvenirs. Would you like a souvenir?

60
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:51,266
The best present ever. Go for it! It's cheap!

61
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:55,937
Kittens. How much for pussycats? A foreigner.

62
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,922
"Pstsieku, pstsieku, please, lady."

63
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,541
Я... Я...

64
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,459
Oh, German! I knew it!

65
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:05,595
Allow me to introduce myself, Gaius Julius Caesar. A pleasure.

66
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:07,763
Just Julius to my friends.

67
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,748
I am archivist and cultural attache,

68
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,283
in terms of foreign relations.

69
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,309
and foreign public relations.

70
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,477
Heartfelt gratitude.

71
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:16,395
How I adore Germany.

72
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:18,956
Especially London. How's Montmartre?

73
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:22,476
How is it? The old man's chipper.

74
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:25,670
He's chugging along, even though he's not strong enough anymore.

75
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,739
You know, there's no one in the middle of nowhere to talk to.

76
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:30,657
How much for chocolates?

77
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,617
2,50.

78
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:33,535
Let's go. I must introduce you to the Prince immediately.

79
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:36,537
No, I can't. Busy.

80
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,455
Expensive and stiff.

81
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:41,592
Come, come. First of all, as a foreigner.

82
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:44,018
you have to sign the prince's address anyway.

83
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:47,088
And secondly, the Prince loves stories.

84
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:50,099
Let him hear about foreign countries, that's all.

85
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:53,993
And they also have toilets all over the street.

86
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:57,964
You pay the money, you do your job, and then you go on your way.

87
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:01,091
How? And they take money for that?

88
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:01,925
Prince.

89
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:06,078
Pardon me. How? It's a relief for you and a profit for the treasury.

90
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:08,131
Is that so?

91
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:09,857
I-I.

92
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:14,461
Interesting. It's a clever idea.

93
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:16,380
I found it, Prince.

94
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, a book of titels. What titels? What have you brought, you fool?

95
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:33,893
Book of honorary visitors.

96
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:38,114
There! You've got a lot of tithele, tithele, tithele. Write it quickly.

97
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:43,485
Okay, let's start with the red line here. What do you want me to call you?

98
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:46,746
Basurman, I mean, Baron.

99
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:50,333
Von, then. It means Baron von Kurdyuk.

100
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:55,186
Duke, that's Duke in German. It's a famous name.

101
00:07:56,855 --> 00:08:00,433
Well, please, scribble here as a memento.

102
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:25,054
That's how they do it. And they also say that in Europe,

103
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,713
if a king or even a duke comes out,

104
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:28,631
and God forbid he should fall at his feet.

105
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,233
Not my God!

106
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,125
Yes, how?

107
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:35,345
Here's how. All you have to do is nod your head and smile politely.

108
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:37,264
It's called human rights.

109
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:43,278
They have a lot of nonsense, of course, but there are also useful things.

110
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:45,004
Thank you, Baron, for the interesting story.

111
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:47,747
I think it's time for us to introduce all sorts of Europe.

112
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:50,759
Otherwise we'll spend the rest of our lives as fools. What do you think?

113
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,843
It's time, it's time.

114
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:54,595
Baron, could you teach us a lesson?

115
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:56,571
Teach us how?

116
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:58,624
You know, your Europe.

117
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:03,352
Yeah, we can do that. That, as they say, with our pleasure.

118
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:08,215
Well, here's the deal. We'll start tomorrow.

119
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:26,822
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

120
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:28,606
No, I won't. He'll pull my head off.

121
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:31,100
Relax. I'll take care of everything.

122
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,071
Be brave. He'll thank us afterwards.

123
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,634
Guten morgen, guten morgen. How did you sleep?

124
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:42,169
Oh, you. Take that!

125
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:42,993
No need, dear Prince.

126
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:43,953
I'll give it to you, guten morgen.

127
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:45,363
Oh, don't.

128
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:48,173
But scientists in Europe have calculated that...

129
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:51,242
That one bucket of cold water prolongs life by three months.

130
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:54,254
Really?

131
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:56,172
I-I.

132
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:26,481
Stop. I'll explain again. Look at me.

133
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:34,787
There, there, that kind of casual smile.

134
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:38,374
And no bowing. My lordship, one more time.

135
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:42,019
How many times?! We've been here for an hour, and it's no use.

136
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:45,405
You, you, you! Even I've already understood. And you!

137
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,639
Well, that's it. Come on, Baron, take care of them here.

138
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,558
When you wake up, you'll be ready to call. I've got enough to do.

139
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:51,159
Julius, follow me!

140
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:23,387
You are our merciful man, accept the gift, do us mercy. This is the way it's supposed to be.

141
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:29,017
If you don't give a little bit of this, what's it called, corruption, they will laugh at you.

142
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,253
Uh, why all at once? Come on, let's all get in line.

143
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:47,749
Yes, Mother, I've got such power, that it's like a wow.

144
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,844
Tomorrow I'm going to put everyone in the oven mitts, all of them.

145
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,954
Well, hold on!

146
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:55,873
What about the palace?

147
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:57,215
Is it beautiful?

148
00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:01,301
Yes, beautiful, beautiful. I was...

149
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,754
At school they called me Kurdyuk. So I just blurted it out to them:

150
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,931
"Baron, I'm Kuryuk.

151
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:13,003
And this one started whispering to the prince: "Kurdyuk, that means Duke in their language."

152
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:16,974
You're a dust in front of him, he says.

153
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,443
Tell me, in this palace of the prince,

154
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:23,361
are there a lot of girls?

155
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:25,989
Well, ladies, I mean.

156
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:28,483
Dames? What ladies?

157
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,402
You, mother, must be full of hen's porridge.

158
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:32,320
Who's going to let them in?

159
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,897
That's why everything goes wrong with you men.

160
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:37,816
That's what?

161
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:39,734
Because you don't let us in.

162
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:41,010
Fools!

163
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,556
Come on. Let's go to bed or something.

164
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,474
There's a lot of work tomorrow.

165
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:12,536
Guten morgen. Guten morgen. How did you sleep?

166
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,744
Well, Baron, thank you, as they say, for the science.

167
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:23,662
By the way, we learned a lot of useful things.

168
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:28,842
It's a pity I won't be able to get to your Europe.

169
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,185
How? They won't.

170
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,103
That's it. We've learned and that's enough.

171
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,664
Tomorrow my bogatyrs are coming from the outpost.

172
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:37,791
We have a military review as planned.

173
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:42,270
Hey, are you offended, or what? Come here.

174
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,847
I want to reward you. It's valuable, by the way.

175
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:49,943
Smuggled all the way from Europe. Here.

176
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:06,507
That's it. Resignation.

177
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:08,425
What?!

178
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:11,495
You're deaf, aren't you? I said resignation.

179
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:13,087
It's all gone.

180
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,715
It's ruined! And you're glad.

181
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:17,633
You're all sulking now.

182
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,702
I'm telling you, you men,

183
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:23,513
you can't do anything serious without us.

184
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,049
All right. Let me show you something.

185
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,022
What is it?

186
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,941
You like it?

187
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:38,859
I sewed it myself.

188
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:44,297
I don't get it at all. Where's it going?

189
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,601
Ouch. Where, where?

190
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:53,246
It was my dream. I wanted to be a maid of honor.

191
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:55,864
A maid of honor...

192
00:14:57,207 --> 00:15:01,754
Yes, a maid of honor... And I will be! Look what I've got.

193
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,659
Why is that?

194
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:13,896
None of your business. I wonder who would agree to be a prince?

195
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,390
Well... it's... I can do it!

196
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,951
You can... Oh, yes.

197
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:23,046
You've taken great power over the boyars. All right,

198
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:26,240
you'll be a prince. Just watch out for me.

199
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,051
Do everything my way. All right?

200
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:31,736
It's all right! Only tomorrow the bogatyrs are coming back.

201
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:33,271
What about them?

202
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:38,584
No. We'll save you for another time.

203
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:41,778
Here's what we'll do with the bogatyrs.

204
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,312
Well, here we are at last.

205
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:23,998
Yes, what a beauty.

206
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:27,201
So I tell Lyubava too, why go somewhere?

207
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:30,970
And she kept saying: vacation, vacation. What for?

208
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,382
I'll do some exercise, walk three or four versts, and that's my vacation.

209
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:39,219
Eh, Alyosha, sometimes the soul also requires rest.

210
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:43,372
And strength, in general, should go to the mind.

211
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,892
If the head weakens, it's not long to lose strength.

212
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:51,880
Look what I've lost? Did you see that?

213
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,798
I haven't lost anything.

214
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,462
Well, that's the way it is.

215
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:25,382
Let me pass, good man.

216
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:28,202
Come on in. Come on in, Grandma.

217
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:39,904
Gone. Gone. Gone!

218
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:41,755
Ope.

219
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:51,413
Ouch. Thank you so much. You helped out an old lady.

220
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,715
Why, Grandma, are you going far away?

221
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:59,211
No, I'm not far away. And you, my dear, if you're not too weak.

222
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:00,870
won't you help me again?

223
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,789
Gladly, Granny. Tell me.

224
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,707
What do you want me to do?

225
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:10,212
Look at my barrel, it's a fine one.

226
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,898
But it's a little rusty.

227
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:16,667
It needs a little shake on the inside. Can you do that?

228
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:20,053
What are you talking about? Yes, we can!

229
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,449
Well, that's good. I'll put some water on it afterwards,

230
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:26,575
and the water will swell it up, honey.

231
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:46,852
Hush, you wicked one, don't lose the barrel!

232
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:57,910
Why, brothers? The old dandelion lady tricked us good and proper.

233
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,872
Oh, my shoulder's open.

234
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:07,569
No, did you see that?

235
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:17,669
She fights.

236
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:05,817
Careful, careful, Kolyvan.

237
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:14,900
Give me an answer...

238
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,394
You're a bastard and I'm not.

239
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:22,631
Give me an answer...

240
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:25,700
Give me an answer... Ah, here!

241
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,947
Whose living portrait do you keep? Let him go free,

242
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:34,208
Let him come to my captivity.

243
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:44,758
Look...

244
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:47,252
Taste the strength of a bogatyr.

245
00:22:47,252 --> 00:22:50,130
You fell down and did your push-ups.

246
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,048
Just like alive. Really?

247
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,693
Well, that's how it is.

248
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:58,829
It's the third hour of the show for the troops.

249
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:01,256
Let them just show up - I'll give them a good time.

250
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,200
It must be Alyosha again.

251
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,668
Where's the painting gone?

252
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,629
It's bad luck.

253
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:12,123
There's plenty of space.

254
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:14,041
This is where I'm going to fix it.

255
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,794
All my things will fit in here.

256
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:18,971
Why is it so low, it doesn't go any higher?

257
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:23,632
We'll put the fridge in the corner and the flowers here.

258
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:31,689
Okay, a broom... We'll hang the broom here.

259
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:33,607
And that's all for the garbage.

260
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:38,087
This... how did you get... Guards!

261
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:42,949
Get them!

262
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,294
Come on, you two unpleasant-looking men from the box,

263
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:50,680
come out and use your cudgel to teach the insolent man a lesson.

264
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,873
Hey, why are you so small?

265
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:18,879
That one over there in the crown.

266
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:24,825
Uh, uh. What's that for? Where are you going? I've got a posse built over there.

267
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:29,621
You think you can handle my posse?

268
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:32,825
This is ridiculous. Isn't it, Julius?

269
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:35,702
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I think there's been a misunderstanding.

270
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:38,579
I think the Baron is just a little offended.

271
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,898
So, first, I propose we form a conciliation committee.

272
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,543
Second, we should definitely invite foreign observers.

273
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:51,240
And finally, thirdly, we'll kill several birds with one stone...

274
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,820
One last warning,

275
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,023
the three bogeymen will be here literally any minute now.

276
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:05,560
Julius!

277
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,478
Horses and hares - friendship forever.

278
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:13,550
Let's go! The fatherland is in danger!

279
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,126
Come on, get him out of there.

280
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:36,828
Quiet! Quiet!

281
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:46,544
Friends! Faithful defenders of the city of Kiev, here!

282
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:51,282
You all saw it for yourselves.

283
00:25:51,282 --> 00:26:00,106
Our prince, before... appointed me supreme ruler.

284
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:05,151
Liar!

285
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:08,163
Prince, don't push so hard, my hooves are slipping.

286
00:26:08,163 --> 00:26:11,549
The hooves are slipping? Do you know what's going to slide now?

287
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,069
Well, wait. Let me just get to you.

288
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:18,455
There's a piece of iron sticking out here, maybe it's a ladder, what do you think?

289
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:20,565
Let me show you, Duke...

290
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:24,209
I'll make you emperor, I'll make you Caesar.

291
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:38,405
Well, go.

292
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,806
Oh, look. Look, bogatyrs. Hush, hush.

293
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:58,671
Taste the enemy's mighty strength.

294
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:03,726
If your elbow itches, it's a good thing.

295
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:05,644
There's an omen.

296
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,989
Do we understand?

297
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:15,303
Bogatyrs, tell everyone if the Prince has named me his successor.

298
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:16,895
Yes!

299
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:23,359
Hooray!

300
00:27:24,952 --> 00:27:29,114
Hey, wait. Where are you going? Julius, come on, quickly get down.

301
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,033
Immediately, I said!

302
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:31,925
Where am I going to go?

303
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:35,061
I don't know where. Hurry up, the men are leaving.

304
00:27:35,061 --> 00:27:36,078
What is it?

305
00:27:36,078 --> 00:27:39,214
Prince, I don't want to upset you, but now we're going down.

306
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:42,667
And not quickly, as you wanted, but very quickly.

307
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:46,312
What's going on up there?

308
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,093
Mom! Aah!

309
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:24,418
Everyone turn in their silver spoons and forks.

310
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:32,417
Oh, look - Prince Kurdyuk.

311
00:28:35,928 --> 00:28:39,323
Well, have you sat down? Let the others sit.

312
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:41,241
All right.

313
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:45,903
You know what, Kolyvan. I don't want to be a maid of honor.

314
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:54,478
A maid of honor. I'll become a tsarevna at once.

315
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:01,892
Did you catch the prince?

316
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:05,412
Why did you come, then? Go look for him!

317
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,263
Yes, all over the city.

318
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:08,865
And when you find him...

319
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:09,632
...you'll throw him in jail.

320
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:13,085
No! Oh...

321
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:46,204
Oh, finally. Are you awake?

322
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:49,014
Were we the ones who were sleeping?

323
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,932
Yes, we were. I've been up a long time.

324
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:53,369
I'm so hungry.

325
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:56,754
Let's get out of here.

326
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:08,772
It's... what is it? Is that... where are we going?

327
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:12,993
Holy shit, it's the sea.

328
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:14,470
The sea.

329
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,405
The sea! Yay!

330
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:20,733
Well...

331
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:21,625
Yeah...

332
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:26,555
You know, Nastasia keeps telling me, too:

333
00:30:26,555 --> 00:30:28,473
"Let's go to the sea. Let's go..."

334
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,693
And I say to her: "What haven't I seen there?"

335
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:37,105
And here it turns out to be nice.

336
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:40,366
Yes, consider that you were sent on vacation.

337
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:44,836
I don't need a vacation without Nastasia.

338
00:30:46,697 --> 00:30:51,358
Me and Alyona, she's on business trips, I'm on exploits.

339
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:53,603
Eh!

340
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:03,510
No, I can't do that.

341
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:06,513
I have to eat first, and then go on vacation.

342
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:09,332
You lie here for now, and I'll go and have a look around.

343
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:51,400
You don't have to show your tongue to good people.

344
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:59,208
Hey, that's nice.

345
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:04,512
Ow, ow, ow.

346
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:30,476
You'll know how to deal with the Russian bogatyr.

347
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:38,014
Oh, there's food.

348
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:00,650
Dookey Speak...?

349
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:07,172
All right, then.

350
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,611
I'll be off then.

351
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:22,394
Oh, thank you.

352
00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:29,491
See what I can show you.

353
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:55,129
Eh, when we get home, I'll take Alenka in my arms and we'll go away.

354
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:57,949
I don't know, to the lakes or somewhere else.

355
00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:00,443
Well, or mushrooming as a last resort.

356
00:34:00,443 --> 00:34:05,238
That's right. I'll take mine somewhere, too.

357
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:08,749
To her mother, for example, she's been asking for a long time.

358
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:12,720
Let's go, what's there, for two weeks.

359
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,765
No, two weeks is a lot. A week. Or three days, at least.

360
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:21,544
You hear that?

361
00:34:21,544 --> 00:34:23,462
Yeah.

362
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,380
Isn't Aleshka weird?

363
00:34:54,855 --> 00:34:58,116
Alyosha, what are you doing here?

364
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,446
And these are my students.

365
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:07,899
Bow, bow.

366
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,625
Well, Alyosha.

367
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,544
Wait, actor.

368
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:14,229
What are you doing, brothers? I'm trying for everyone.

369
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:16,790
Look how much food I got.

370
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,051
Here. To eat the worm.

371
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,737
Raw fish.

372
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:27,657
Yes? I hadn't noticed.

373
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:30,343
All right, guys, stand back.

374
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:34,097
Eh, now we can go to bed. I hope it doesn't rain tonight.

375
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:42,978
Look how fast they put the handkerchiefs up.

376
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:44,897
At least we'll get some sleep.

377
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:51,678
Here you go, old man, I give you this.

378
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,338
What is that noise?

379
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:06,257
Sleep, Alyosha.

380
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:32,470
Yes, what the oligarchs have brought the country to.

381
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,199
What are we supposed to do?

382
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:03,297
Get out of here! Go home and be as quiet as possible.

383
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:04,889
I'll call you when I need you.

384
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:06,807
Yeah.

385
00:38:12,888 --> 00:38:15,056
The prince has not much money.

386
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:18,384
Well, that's all right. I'll just draw up a decree.

387
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:19,794
A ball.

388
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:20,494
What?

389
00:38:20,494 --> 00:38:22,412
A ball! Money later.

390
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:24,973
Right now I want a ball.

391
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:26,891
With musicians and everything proper.

392
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,894
What a ball! An edict first. And then...

393
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:34,373
Kolyvan, I think you've forgotten who's in charge here.

394
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:36,675
Not at all, Mother.

395
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:40,128
I'm just sitting here thinking about...

396
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,144
About money.

397
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:45,432
You have only money in your head.

398
00:38:45,432 --> 00:38:48,309
What money? I'm thinking about the ball.

399
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:50,486
Well, the cooks are more or less clear.

400
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:53,364
But which artists should I invite?

401
00:38:55,598 --> 00:39:00,010
Eat, Alyosha, eat. You must have been hungry during your march.

402
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,780
No. I'm not asking about the service. I understand.

403
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,341
It's a state secret. Well, at least tell me,

404
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,259
Maybe you met something interesting on the way.

405
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:11,587
Did you get there by a shuttle bus or what?

406
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:15,040
Oh, and how are Dobrynka and Ilya doing?

407
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:20,987
You're silent. Don't you like me now, Alyosha?

408
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:26,483
You're running around like a squirrel in a wheel. And he comes and doesn't say a word!

409
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:30,386
At least once cleaned the floor, or the dishes.

410
00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:31,854
If you say so, I'll do it.

411
00:39:31,854 --> 00:39:35,815
Well, I'm giving you an order. Wash the floor now, aspirin!

412
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:54,748
Oh, Alyosha, what are you. I was just kidding.

413
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:58,834
Yes, you must be sick from me. Well?

414
00:40:06,642 --> 00:40:08,944
He is not reflected in the mirror.

415
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,566
Wake up, brothers, wake up.

416
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:26,592
What happened?

417
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,786
A butterfly in the plague, trouble in the dumas.

418
00:40:29,786 --> 00:40:32,404
There's an omen.

419
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:35,541
You said it yourself - vacation.

420
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:38,677
No, brothers, we must hurry home.

421
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:41,295
I smell trouble in Kiev.

422
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:44,940
I agree. There's a reason we were crammed into a barrel.

423
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,858
I thought it was suspicious at once.

424
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:53,764
The great ones are awake!

425
00:40:56,901 --> 00:41:00,095
May you have a good morning.

426
00:41:00,095 --> 00:41:02,013
And it turns out they can talk.

427
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:04,698
Oh, we great ones live in fear.

428
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:07,451
And we try not to make unnecessary noises.

429
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:08,852
Something does not seem.

430
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:11,345
Yes, wait, Alyosha, let the man speak.

431
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:13,973
Go on, old man.

432
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:18,126
Life isn't easy. But it's going to be different now.

433
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:20,687
Because at last the heavens

434
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,948
has sent us great fire-giving kings.

435
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:28,226
Please accept these signs of a higher power.

436
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:34,499
What kind of joke is that?

437
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:36,801
It's not fitting for a Russian bogatyr to dress up as a tsar.

438
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:39,995
Wait, Dobrynya. Old man, why do you need tsars?

439
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:42,038
You seem to be a free people.

440
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:45,817
It's written in our ancient book.

441
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:47,984
They can also read.

442
00:41:47,984 --> 00:41:50,286
Alyosha, give you a break at last.

443
00:41:50,286 --> 00:41:56,425
It is written that only great kings can protect us from Gamu.

444
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:58,343
What else Gamu?

445
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:03,081
Yes, some kind of monster, which in ancient times invented.

446
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:08,318
So that children wouldn't go into the woods. And those poor souls still believe it.

447
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:13,373
We have to help out. Listen up, everyone!

448
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:16,125
You don't have to be afraid of Gamma anymore.

449
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,427
There is no Gamuma!

450
00:42:18,427 --> 00:42:22,005
That's why nobody's going to eat anybody. Don't worry.

451
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:23,923
The word of a great man.

452
00:42:28,594 --> 00:42:31,529
The word of a great king.

453
00:42:32,556 --> 00:42:36,200
The great kings said that Gamuma is no longer feared.

454
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,929
Thank you, as they say, for the bread and salt. But they're waiting for us at home.

455
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,634
How will we get back to Kiev?

456
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:08,552
By swimming, of course.

457
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:13,223
By swimming? No, you can't swim, it's too long.

458
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,717
Well, how then?

459
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:17,827
By ship.

460
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:19,486
Well, you're giving, Alyosha.

461
00:43:19,486 --> 00:43:20,963
Where could he come from here?

462
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:22,882
Yes, exactly, brothers, the ship.

463
00:43:22,882 --> 00:43:24,800
Hey! On the ship!

464
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,485
We're here! Swim here!

465
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:29,461
Look, that's right.

466
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:30,612
We'll soon be in Kiev.

467
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:37,010
Look, they've come to see us off. Goodbye!

468
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:52,097
What's that?

469
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:53,766
Isn't that Gamuma?

470
00:43:56,192 --> 00:43:58,178
I thought you said there was no Gamuma.

471
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,096
Well, my mistake.

472
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,290
Ilya, Dobrynya.

473
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:29,954
You shouldn't offend ordinary people.

474
00:44:29,954 --> 00:44:31,872
Yes. And if you are.

475
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:45,300
Hey, big guy, whoever hurts my friends has to deal with me.

476
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:22,640
Taste the strength of a bogatyr.

477
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,735
Well, that's the way it is.

478
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:18,596
Is your name Gamumu?

479
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:21,598
Okay. Well, Gamumu,

480
00:46:21,598 --> 00:46:25,626
you're going to promise us that you'll never

481
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:27,544
you'll never do anything naughty again.

482
00:46:27,544 --> 00:46:30,230
If we hear one more time...

483
00:46:31,448 --> 00:46:32,724
Well, you know.

484
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:37,711
Gamumu won't hurt anybody else.

485
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,630
Gamumu's word.

486
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:44,617
Hooray! Hooray!

487
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:48,837
What are you so happy about? We lost a ship because of you.

488
00:46:48,837 --> 00:46:52,674
And your book doesn't say when the next ship will be.

489
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,127
A hundred years from now.

490
00:46:56,127 --> 00:46:57,345
How long?

491
00:46:57,345 --> 00:47:00,539
Are we going to be here forever?

492
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:04,951
I've got Lyubava there. I mean, she's, you know.

493
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:07,828
She doesn't know.

494
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:12,816
Yeah, what's up, brother? We're not staying here. We'll think of something.

495
00:47:12,816 --> 00:47:14,734
Right, Dobrynja?

496
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:16,652
We'll think of something.

497
00:47:22,024 --> 00:47:26,177
Oh, he's not reflected in the mirror!

498
00:47:28,996 --> 00:47:33,341
He doesn't cast a shadow. Look.

499
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:36,152
What about you?

500
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:37,629
Not reflected in the mirror.

501
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:40,631
Dobrynyushka, what happened to you?

502
00:47:41,082 --> 00:47:44,151
It's no use. I've already tortured him.

503
00:47:44,151 --> 00:47:46,069
Well, what did he say?

504
00:47:46,894 --> 00:47:49,906
"Fell down and squeezed" and laughs.

505
00:47:49,906 --> 00:47:51,881
He doesn't remember anything.

506
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:53,800
Witchcraft.

507
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,593
Exactly.

508
00:47:55,593 --> 00:47:57,512
Where are our real husbands?

509
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,060
Let the prince give us the answer.

510
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,978
Where and why he sent them. Let's go to him.

511
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:22,257
Prince! Julius!

512
00:48:23,476 --> 00:48:25,586
Prince, where are you going?

513
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:28,271
Julius, stop!

514
00:48:30,439 --> 00:48:32,616
Severe punishment.

515
00:48:32,616 --> 00:48:34,793
An edict from the supreme ruler:

516
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:38,687
that all silverware be surrendered by tomorrow.

517
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:40,606
Severe punishment.

518
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:44,442
Everyone surrender their silverware by tomorrow.

519
00:48:44,442 --> 00:48:46,361
Hey, who's the supreme ruler?

520
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:48,279
What about our prince?

521
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:51,674
There's our prince running to turn in the silverware.

522
00:48:51,674 --> 00:48:53,592
Yes. I guess something bad happened.

523
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:57,103
And you just guessed? Of course it happened.

524
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:59,347
It happened to our husbands.

525
00:48:59,347 --> 00:49:00,623
It happened to the Prince.

526
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:02,541
With Kiev, at last, it happened.

527
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:04,776
Oops.

528
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:07,212
See, here comes another hero.

529
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:09,131
Now they're all going to shake and run

530
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:11,049
like cockroaches with those dishes.

531
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:13,475
I'd just like to punch him in the forehead!

532
00:49:13,475 --> 00:49:14,818
Gorynych!

533
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:15,710
Yes, it's us.

534
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,628
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

535
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:19,355
Come on, what's the big deal.

536
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:23,191
We were told to turn in the dishes.

537
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:26,587
So we went. Who knows, maybe they really need it.

538
00:49:26,587 --> 00:49:28,505
What's going on here, anyway?

539
00:49:28,505 --> 00:49:30,423
Oh, Gorynch, my dear.

540
00:49:30,865 --> 00:49:33,042
We're in trouble!

541
00:49:57,979 --> 00:50:00,157
Tikhon, are you home?

542
00:50:01,816 --> 00:50:03,734
Yeah, I think I am.

543
00:50:05,653 --> 00:50:08,789
Stop. You stay here for now. Check the tail, report back.

544
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:09,997
Go, go.

545
00:50:09,997 --> 00:50:13,642
Prince, maybe we'd better set fire to Kiev and retreat in an orderly fashion?

546
00:50:24,711 --> 00:50:27,329
A tail like a tail. What's there to check?

547
00:50:33,276 --> 00:50:37,621
And what the bastards have come up with. They put toilets everywhere.

548
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:41,591
And they charge workers three times the price for this very thing. What's it like?

549
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:43,510
It's an outrage. Everything is getting more expensive:

550
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,779
and buckwheat and grits and butter.

551
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:49,104
Exactly. Well... Here's the thing, brothers.

552
00:50:49,197 --> 00:50:52,461
It's important for us to hold out until the bogatyrs come.

553
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:56,234
In the meantime we'll organize a partisan unit with the traitor.

554
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:03,076
With the chairman. A cell, so to speak, of resistance.

555
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:07,360
I report: the tail is checked, all clean, no fleas.

556
00:51:13,882 --> 00:51:16,663
Well, go, go, hero.

557
00:51:16,753 --> 00:51:18,039
Dobrynia!

558
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:20,276
He fell down and did his push-ups.

559
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:22,192
That's not Dobrynya.

560
00:51:22,962 --> 00:51:25,296
There, and you didn't believe it.

561
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:29,804
What are you staring at? Come here, you rascals.

562
00:51:53,654 --> 00:51:55,253
Nothing came out.

563
00:51:55,694 --> 00:51:58,386
They said only the prince knows. He personally sent the bogatyrs on a mission.

564
00:51:59,345 --> 00:52:01,008
And where to, no one but him knows.

565
00:52:01,008 --> 00:52:02,926
That's it! Let's go to the palace.

566
00:52:02,926 --> 00:52:05,804
A prince, not a prince. Let the authorities answer where our husbands have gone.

567
00:52:05,804 --> 00:52:08,649
They won't let us into the palace. There will be a ball there.

568
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:12,006
Only musicians and entertainers are allowed. I saw it myself.

569
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:16,738
Everyone turn in their gold coins by tomorrow.

570
00:52:16,738 --> 00:52:19,647
Gold money is going out of circulation

571
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,812
and will be replaced by wooden rubles.

572
00:52:22,812 --> 00:52:24,728
The population will not suffer.

573
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:28,248
Everyone to the palace by tomorrow with gold coins...

574
00:52:28,823 --> 00:52:31,188
Yeah, I know how it won't hurt.

575
00:52:32,787 --> 00:52:36,080
If you say that the population will not suffer. Then that's it...

576
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,295
...save yourselves!

577
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:39,182
Yes, yes!

578
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:50,691
And remember we had a case, too,

579
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:52,610
when they swapped the gold ones for half-gold ones.

580
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,984
Oh, there was a lot of noise.

581
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:57,022
I don't remember! Bloodsuckers! Despots!

582
00:52:57,022 --> 00:52:59,483
Well, you won't have long to feast.

583
00:52:59,573 --> 00:53:02,648
Tikhon, attack. Julius, let's go.

584
00:53:06,613 --> 00:53:09,746
I'll take the pigsty first. Then this object.

585
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:13,711
And from here we go straight to the palace.

586
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:17,707
In brief, comrades, this is our strategic task.

587
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:21,639
But the main thing, of course, is to hold out until the arrival of bogatyrs.

588
00:53:22,468 --> 00:53:27,554
The whole barn, that is, all of us. Julius, give me the next poster.

589
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:29,792
Don't make me laugh.

590
00:53:29,882 --> 00:53:30,655
Julius!

591
00:53:37,177 --> 00:53:40,055
This is... Atas.

592
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:22,544
I'm not allowed in!

593
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,102
You must be going to the ball.

594
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,669
To the ball, to the ball.

595
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:28,581
Well. Come in.

596
00:54:29,738 --> 00:54:31,177
But I won't let you in!

597
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:34,629
Only young people and artists are allowed in.

598
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,859
We are artists. Do you want me to sing?

599
00:54:47,386 --> 00:54:54,037
Cheer up, cheer up. Well, why are we sad?

600
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:59,216
Let's go quickly. Come on. Well, what are you standing there for?!

601
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:04,523
Dance, dance. Spin, spin, spin.

602
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:07,336
Move it!

603
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:12,100
Who dances like that, huh?

604
00:55:12,193 --> 00:55:16,416
What are you playing? Come on... mine!

605
00:55:51,137 --> 00:55:57,723
Will you dance with us, Granny Yagusya, you bony leg?

606
00:56:05,716 --> 00:56:09,584
Kolylivan! Here's the clue.

607
00:56:09,674 --> 00:56:10,991
Gorynych, he's running away.

608
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:12,558
Stop right there!

609
00:56:13,517 --> 00:56:14,636
Grab her!

610
00:56:14,729 --> 00:56:18,568
Where are our husbands? Give me your husbands! Catch them!

611
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:39,158
Do-loy of the oc-ku-pants. People's Avengers.

612
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:42,866
People's Avengers!

613
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,982
Hooray! Did you see that? People are already recognizing us on the street.

614
00:56:47,982 --> 00:56:52,011
Yes, yes. People's support, that's worth a lot.

615
00:56:52,011 --> 00:56:53,929
Exactly.

616
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,500
You remember the plan?

617
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:03,904
No, I haven't. First, get the guns. And then...

618
00:57:04,351 --> 00:57:06,781
And then...

619
00:57:06,781 --> 00:57:09,914
And then the stable, the cowshed and the library!

620
00:57:09,914 --> 00:57:11,827
Why are you yelling?!

621
00:57:17,716 --> 00:57:19,857
What's the matter, honey, are you ashamed?

622
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,169
What is it?

623
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:25,581
They gave up their prince to be mocked, the bastards.

624
00:57:25,581 --> 00:57:28,425
We're men of the service. We do as we're told, we do as we're told.

625
00:57:28,516 --> 00:57:31,207
Servants... Give me that.

626
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:33,119
What are you, uncle?

627
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,779
Uncle? Uncle, you say!

628
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:37,825
People, people!

629
00:57:37,915 --> 00:57:39,168
Oh, oh, oh!

630
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:42,301
Don't believe that blabbermouth baron!

631
00:57:42,394 --> 00:57:45,370
He slandered your Prince. Here I am.

632
00:57:45,464 --> 00:57:48,056
Alive and well.

633
00:57:48,149 --> 00:57:54,130
Oh, the Prince is back alive and well. Hurrah for the prince.

634
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:59,342
Hurrah!

635
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:05,352
What are you doing?

636
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:24,472
The prince is back.

637
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:31,761
We people's avengers will not allow anyone, ever.

638
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:36,780
We demand the immediate return of all silverware.

639
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:39,370
Down with autocracy! Down with the occupiers!

640
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,285
And our Julius will not be harmed.

641
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:45,317
And our prince will not be harmed.

642
00:58:46,979 --> 00:58:48,450
What are you digging for?

643
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,880
It's jammed. Can't you see?

644
00:58:57,721 --> 00:58:59,960
Where the hell have you been? Well!

645
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:06,705
I think I got it. This way, this way, hurry up.

646
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:09,743
You see? Quick, all of them. Can you do it?

647
00:59:09,743 --> 00:59:11,597
The main thing is to catch the prince.

648
00:59:11,597 --> 00:59:13,512
And don't let Gorynych get away.

649
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:22,787
Victory will be ours. Hooray! Take Baron alive.

650
00:59:42,865 --> 00:59:46,062
Taste the might of a bogatyr.

651
00:59:47,277 --> 00:59:48,651
Alyosha!

652
00:59:48,742 --> 00:59:49,835
Ours.

653
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:52,008
Ours?

654
00:59:52,584 --> 00:59:54,694
Hooray!

655
00:59:54,694 --> 00:59:56,607
And I said, I knew it would be.

656
00:59:57,444 --> 01:00:00,513
Taste how strong bogatyrsky.

657
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:03,390
Not ours.

658
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:09,625
I fell down and did my push-ups.

659
01:00:09,718 --> 01:00:11,191
Oh, why, why?

660
01:00:12,662 --> 01:00:16,818
Exactly, we were told to sit still and wait for us.

661
01:00:17,521 --> 01:00:19,408
Well, that's how it is.

662
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:21,550
They were saving us.

663
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:26,858
You traitors! Who did you raise your hand against?

664
01:00:26,858 --> 01:00:31,206
Well, that's it. I gave birth to you, I'll kill you.

665
01:00:36,641 --> 01:00:40,413
Ilyushenka, Alyoshenka, Dobrynyushka.

666
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:54,800
Brothers, look, it's me.

667
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:09,955
Wow.

668
01:01:27,987 --> 01:01:30,384
Well done, Dobrynya. Hurrah!

669
01:01:30,477 --> 01:01:33,422
Taste the strength of a bogatyr.

670
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:29,755
The cows have always shown an interest in me.

671
01:02:33,464 --> 01:02:37,109
There you go. There you go. That's forward, and then you bend it a little bit.

672
01:02:42,543 --> 01:02:44,782
All right, come on. Watch closely there.

673
01:02:44,782 --> 01:02:48,170
You will be king for a reason. Don't shame us.

674
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:52,998
You see, we have a state council right after the farewell.

675
01:02:53,088 --> 01:02:55,875
And then... I have to look at the diary.

676
01:02:55,965 --> 01:02:59,520
Oh, you know what. I'll send you my schedule by jaeger mail.

677
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:03,900
Where can I find you? In the barn. Great. You got a deal.

678
01:03:11,509 --> 01:03:15,666
Dobrynya, put your scarf on immediately, you'll catch cold.

679
01:03:18,607 --> 01:03:20,877
The wind on the river is cold, and his throat is weak.

680
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:23,563
We'll see each other for sure!

681
01:03:23,656 --> 01:03:24,649
Goodbye!

682
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:25,769
Goodbye!

683
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,684
Greetings to Gamuma.
