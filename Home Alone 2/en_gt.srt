Has anyone seen my sun cream?

00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:34,479
What's the point of going to Florida if you have to put the sun cream?

We have already collected rubber sheets

00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:54,814
two hundred points is fine

00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,616
That gives you four thousand seven hundred points

32
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:00,284
Two hundred points is good.

33
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:06,071
Honey, have you gathered yet?

34
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:08,329
Yes. Yes.

35
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:11,759
What did I put?

36
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,054
Yes!

37
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:16,011
Yes!

38
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,998
Oh, and did you see what Grandma Penelope sent for your trip?

39
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:22,761

Why are we going to Florida? There is no Christmas tree in Florida

44
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,157
Kevin why do you stick to Christmas trees?

45
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:38,957
After all, how can you celebrate Christmas without a Christmas tree, Mom?

46
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:42,775
We will buy a good silver artificial one. Or we will decorate a palm tree

47

49
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,034
Honey do you know where the batteries are for this?

50
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:02,569
I put it to charge

51
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:16,120
How is this?

52
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:17,875
This one is better

53
00:04:18,443 --> 00:04:21,314
Hey Kevin, you better go tie your tie

54
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:23,671
Shouldn't we be late for the holiday performance?

55
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:27,343
My tie is in the bathroom, I can't get in - uncle is showering

56
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:31,932
He said that if I come in and see him naked, I won't feel like a real man when I grow up

57
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,885
I didn't understand what he wanted to say

58
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:38,836
He was definitely joking

59
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:43,457
Just go in, grab your tie, get out, and don't look left or right

60
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:18,034
Pull a rud, you degenarate puppy, or you'll eat tadpoles

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,227
Now it's Kevin's solo, tell Leslie

62
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,775
Kevin's solo is coming, tell Frank

63
00:05:58,062 --> 00:05:59,682
It was. Frank. Frank.

64
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,457
End it! End it!

65
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,114
Kevin!

66
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,220
Ladies and gentlemen, members of the jury

67
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:17,290
I apologize to my family for the inconvenience I caused

68
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,457
What?

69
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,343
My joke was childish and inappropriate

70
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:24,951
Childish, not childish, I died of snoring

71
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:30,900
I would also like to apologize to my brother

72
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:32,957
Kevin, I'm sorry

73
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,954
Oh Bass!

74
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:37,810
good job

75
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,214
Kevin, don't you have anything to say?

76
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,210
can you please?

77
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:15,112
I'm not asking for forgiveness, I did the right thing, Bas humiliated me and always

78
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:18,886
comes out from under it. It's not, but because you're so stupid as to believe it

79
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:23,666
its lies, i don't care if your stupid trip to florida is successful or not

80
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,439
And in general, what sane person celebrates Christmas in the heat?

81
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:31,995
Kevin, if you leave the room now, you're going to sleep on the third floor

82
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:32,739
Here's what it is

83
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:34,855
What else can you say?

84
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:38,919
You better not ruin my trip, you grumpy, your father spent a lot of money

85
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,222
Oh, I wouldn't want to spoil your fun, Mr. Pathetic Line

86
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:48,786
What a troubled young man!

87
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:55,469
It's a collection of idiots

88
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:57,780
Hey!

89
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:05,104
You know Kevin, last time we wanted to go on vacation we had the exact same problem

90
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,271
Uh, spilling all the crap on my head

91
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,800
I don't care about your choice of words

92
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:12,173
It wasn't like that last time and it's not like that now

93
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:14,429
Baz apologized to you

94
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:18,452
Yes, how? Then he called me an elephant, and he was not sincere at all

95
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:21,966
It was all about you

96
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:24,977
It would be good if you stay here and think a little about what has happened, and when you are ready

97
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:28,457
to apologize to Buzz and the family, you can come down

98
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:32,557
I'd rather flush the toilet than apologize to Buzz

99
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:34,857
Then you'll stay here all night

100
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,500
Great, I don't want to go downstairs anyway

101
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,871
None of you can be trusted. And you know what, if you are money?

102
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,800
If I had, I would go on a separate trip

103
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:48,068
Alone, without anyone, and I would spend the best days of my life

104
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:51,500
Well, last year your wish came true, maybe this year too?

105
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,586
I hope

106
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:25,277
<< Wet bandits escaped from prison >>

107
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:43,271
More of the same?

108
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:57,209
OK, our McCallisters drive the car on the right, the other McCallisters drive the car on the left

109
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,963
I know I shouldn't complain, after all I'm traveling for free, but you guys

110
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,100
Are you the world's worst alarm clock?

111
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:03,443
Frank, what about the tickets?

112
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:05,543
They are near me. these are your family's, these are mine

113
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,614
How many do you have? - Seven

114
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:08,243
Seven more to me

115
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:09,300
Fourteen.

116
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:18,642
Seven, eight, nine, ten. - Why don't we sit together?

117
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:21,849
I'll be lucky if we end up on the same plane

118
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,150
Eleven, twelve, thirteen

119
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:27,445
where is kevin

120
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:30,371
Fourteen

121
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:32,794
I'd better keep my ticket with me, see you again

122
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:35,072
do you want to forget me again?

123
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:47,843
- Come on Kevin
- Dad I need batteries

124
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:48,486
- I have them in my bag, I will give them on the plane

125
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,714
There are both

126
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:52,300
Now give me another one, I'll take it

127
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,557
Not now. What is our gate?

128
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,145
Uh, seventeen, sir

129
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:58,562
thank you

130
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:01,110
which gate was it?

131
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:04,157
Seventeen, Bass. We went to Kevin

132
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,929
Will you take my bag?

133
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,529
Come come

134
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:40,159
American Airlines flight number "two, two, six" is preparing to take off to New York

135
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:45,711
Well, well, soon!

136
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:49,660
Dad, wait!

137
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:56,477
Dad, wait!

138
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:58,232

139
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:01,050

00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:03,801

00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:17,588
here we are, here we are

143
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,029
We made it

144
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,237
Are you all here?
We made it

145
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,957
Madam, please come in, the plane is about to take off

146
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:30,543
Let me see, is that all?

147
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:31,814
We'll let everyone in

148
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:33,383
Merry Christmas

149
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:35,200
- Have a nice flight

150
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:36,200
- success
- success

151
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:42,614
Wait, people, wait for me!

152
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:45,904
You barely made it

153
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,086
Really?

154
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,043
- Merry Christmas
- Merry Christmas!

155
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:49,986
Wait! wait!

156
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,971
Wait!

157
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,537
I apologize

158
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,314
Nothing, nothing. Is this your missile?

159
00:13:57,315 --> 00:14:01,771
Yes, I am with my family, they are already on the plane, I don't want to stay here either

160
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:02,542
Do you have a ticket?

161
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:03,785
Somewhere here...

162
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:06,643
They are already ready for flight

163
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:10,857
Tell him not to fly. The same thing happened last year, my Christmas was ruined

164
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:12,943
Are you sure your family is on this plane?

165
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:16,472
Yes, my dad walked in just as we collided

166
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:20,029
Okay, put him on the plane, but make sure he finds his family

167
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:20,802
It was, come on

168
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:26,759
Well, where is your family?

169
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,771
Uh, it's my dad

170
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:32,529
Very well, go find a free place. Merry Christmas

171
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,314
Yours too

172
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:38,929
Ladies and gentlemen, in order to prepare for take off, all passengers need to be seated and fasten their seat belts.

173
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,705
Have you ever been to Florida?

174
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:36,897
Welcome to American Airlines

175
00:15:36,897 --> 00:15:39,962
Flight number one, seven, six to New York, non-stop

176
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,100
It seemed to me that we would not make it

177
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,770
What's the matter, my dear?

178
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,879
I kind of am

179
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:01,596
Did we forget something?

180
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,833
No, I don't think we've forgotten, but you kind of have a premonition.

181
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,257
Just bad memories

182
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:12,464
We have done everything, we have brought everything, everyone is here

183
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,147
Nothing to worry about

184
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,728
Ha, ha, you're right, you're right, everything is fine

185
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:24,344
Nothing to worry about

186
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:44,982
Mom?

187
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:47,901
Dad?

188
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,601
Frank?

189
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:52,795
Baz?

190
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:02,271
(the film was recorded for the moviesinarm.ru website. Watch all movies in HD quality on the moviesinarm.ru website)

191
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,700
We were the last

192
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,459
Where are they?

193
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:22,242
Is it Megan's? Brooke: Give it to Brooke. This is Kevin

194
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:33,628
- Give it to Kevin
- Give it to Kevin

195
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:36,083
Take it, Kevin!

196
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:58,000
- Kevin is not here
- Kevin is not here

197
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,029
What?

198
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:04,429
Kevin!

199
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:35,445
Sorry, it's an emergency

200
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,495
Yes, sir?

201
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:43,545
- What city is this
- New York, sir?

202
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,925
I did the same thing again

203
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:52,320
Is something wrong sir?

204
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:56,624
It will be good

205
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,883
Oh, come on. My family is in Florida and I'm in New York

206
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:14,984
My family is in Florida.

207
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:19,557
i new york?

208
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,314
What is the baby's name?

209
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:09,114
Kevin.

210
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:12,348
When was the last time you saw it?

211
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:13,125
In the car?

212
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,281
No, he was at the doors, he was with us at the airport

213
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,727
Most people lose each other during the inspection. Did everyone pass the inspection?

214
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,586
I don't know, Peter?

215
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:28,731
We were in a hurry, we ran towards the goal all the time

216
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:31,249
When did you notice Kevin was gone?

217
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,202
When we were already receiving luggage

218
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:38,725
- Has your son ever run away from home
- No

219
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:41,205
Has he ever been left alone?

220
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,689
In fact, something like this has happened before

221
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:53,204
This is already becoming a McCallister camping tradition

222
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,945
It's funny that we never lose our suitcases

223
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:12,509
We left it at home last year, by accident

224
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:17,267
Yes, that's what my wife meant by family tradition

225
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:22,538
We will call Chicago and

226
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:26,160
we will inform about the situation, it is possible that it will be there

227
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,671
We are grateful

228
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,257
Unlikely to be anywhere else

229
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:48,705
Be careful, boy!

230
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,982
Where is your card?

231
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:13,360
This is New York, Marv, the land of opportunity

232
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:15,942
Can you smell it?

233
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:17,142
Yes՜

234
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:18,929
You know what?

235
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,662
- Fish
- Freedom

236
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:23,822
No, it's a fish

237
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,590
It's freedom and money

238
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,943
Okay, okay, it's freedom

239
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:31,657
Okay, let's go before we get caught

240
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:32,857
But it is the fish.

241
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:40,647
It's easy and fast

242
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:46,317
Then we take fake passports and go to distant countries

243
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,561
Arizona?

244
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:59,843
That was very cute, Marv. We escaped from prison. to steal fourteen cents from Santa Claus?

245
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:02,858
Well, "grinder" is always a benefit, taste too

246
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:07,259
we got a new nickname: we will be "sticky bandits".

247
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:31,592
"Sticky Bandits" at the Plaza Hotel, New York's coolest hotel

248
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:45,615
Mental

249
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:43,614
What happened

250
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:48,272
I saw something, as if

251
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,650
<<Excuse me, I was distracted>>

252
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,675
It was the place, move, go!

253
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:07,172
Like I liked it

254
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,870
- Excuse me, where is the hall?
- Down the corridor to the left
- Thank you

255
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,233
Yesterday, new star Ding Dang Dong was hosted at the world famous Plaza Hotel

256
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:24,017
In the most wonderful hotel in New York. To book a room, call the following toll-free number

257
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:28,105
one, eight hundred, seven hundred and fifty nine, three thousand

258
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:29,995
But I won't call

259
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,539
Greetings, Peter McCallister's father speaking

260
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:41,655
I need a room with a big bed, a TV and a small fridge that can be locked with a key

261
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:44,389
Credit card now?

262
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,267
Plaza reservation department: how can I help you

263
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:54,777
Greetings, Peter McCallister's father speaking

264
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,771
I need a room

265
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:57,732
Sex, of course

266
00:27:57,754 --> 00:28:01,021
With a large bed, TV

267
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:04,791
and with a small refrigerator, closed with a key

268
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:08,065
You must have a major credit card

269
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:09,752
Credit card now?

270
00:28:11,052 --> 00:28:12,807
Thank you, happy holiday.

271
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,607
Two on eight, Henry, Mr. Yamamoto

272
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:21,902
One credit

273
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:27,994
I will call you

274
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:32,095
Hello to you

275
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:40,836
- May I help
- booking under McCallister's name?

276
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,363
Booking under your name?

277
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:49,439
Madam, my feet barely reach the ground, I can barely see you too, how?

278
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:52,024
can i book a room

279
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:56,344
Think, the child enters the hotel and makes a reservation?

280
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,981
I do not think

281
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,322
Sorry, I got confused

282
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:05,642
I am traveling with my father, now he has work, he has a meeting

283
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:08,842
I can't stand meetings

284
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:11,872
They don't let you in, you have to sit and wait. It's borring.

285
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:15,155
That's why my father brought me down here. Gave credit

286
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:20,205
the card and told me to register and go to the room so as not to do anything stupid

287
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:24,087
Let me tell you, I do stupid things once in a while

288
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:26,837
We all do

289
00:29:29,757 --> 00:29:31,174
Congratulations to you too.

290
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:33,672
No trace

291
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:38,886
- Yes, we should stay in touch. Do you have a hotel
- Yes

292
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,468
Do you have any recent photos?

293
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,315
I have one in my wallet

294
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,235
My wallet is missing

295
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,832
It was in my bag.

296
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:54,246
Kevin rummaged through my bag at the airport, looking for people.

297
00:29:54,246 --> 00:29:59,277
- My wallet is with him.
- Did you have a credit card in your wallet?

298
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:02,547
- Both card and money.
You should urgently inform the bank if your son

299
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:05,565
has a card, then the location will be fixed when using it

300
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:08,805
You know, I don't think so. whether he knows how to use it

301
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:13,750
It worked

302
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:22,170
- Cedric
- Yes
? - They don't count tips in a public place

303
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:27,300
- I 'm sorry
- And find out everything about that young man !

304
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:30,869
Please here

305
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:38,748
I wish you a pleasant pastime. Please don't forget

306
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:42,062
to tell your father when he comes that he must come down

307
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:43,592
and sign a couple of things

308
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:47,415
Thank you for being so kind.
- Can I take your bag?

309
00:30:52,073 --> 00:30:53,220
From the left please

310
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:58,900
- You know, Herbert Hoover once stayed on this floor
- The vacuum cleaner manufacturer?

311
00:30:58,957 --> 00:30:59,957
- No, the president

312
00:31:05,643 --> 00:31:07,671
This is one of our best numbers

313
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:18,162
Excellent

314
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,494
A big bed just for me

315
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:36,167
Luxurious and classy

316
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:44,858
Whatever they thought

317
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:48,554
Hey

318
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:57,092
- Do you want me to put the key in the bag or hang it on it
- I will hang it

319
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,218
Is everything alright sir? Is the temperature okay?

320
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:03,947
It `s good

321
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,475
Do you know how to turn on the TV?

322
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:09,377
I am ten years old, TV is my life.

323
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,373
OK

324
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,060
Oh, sorry!

325
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:23,789
And I still have a lot of them

326
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:27,414
Thank you.

327
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:58,652
Do you mind if I work on my jump a bit?

328
00:32:58,973 --> 00:32:59,564
No

329
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,690
Thank you

330
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:40,469
This is how vacations happen

331
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:42,595
- Don't come forward

332
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:44,940
- It's me, Johnny

333
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:49,581
- I knew it was you. I still smelled you from the elevator.

334
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:52,332
Two balls?

335
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:55,673
Two... put three, I'm not driving

336
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:59,014
- It's a flower, Johnny, your favorite

337
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:02,153
Thank you
- You were here last night too, weren't you?

338
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:08,093
- I used to sing in a cabaret in the evening.
He's lying, he was doing syllabary with your brother

339
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:12,210
- You were here, you were doing syllabary with my brother

340
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:13,600
You saw

341
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:16,471
Well, cut it out, you're doing syllabic with all of them: Staffy, Heli, Leo, To Balmo, Chicky

342
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:25,862
Bobby's, Griffey's... Shall I continue, life?

343
00:34:26,554 --> 00:34:28,039
- You misunderstood

344
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:32,663
- Okay, okay, I believe, my machine doesn't believe.

345
00:34:33,895 --> 00:34:34,418
- Johnny!

346
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,371
- You are the only inhabitant of my heart

347
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:41,299
- Kiss my face and tell me you love me

348
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:45,302
- My dear, I adore you.
- Was your imagination that big?

349
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:51,090
- If love were an ocean, you'd need two planes to cross it

350
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:56,423
- Maybe I'm too soft, but believe me, okay.

351
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:59,039
- That's why I'll let you go.

352
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,604
I'm counting to three

353
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:04,962
disgusting, lying, vile

354
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:08,286
"You don't want to be naked" from here

355
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:10,412
Pulled

356
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:11,594
- One

357
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,922
- Two

358
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,452
- Three

359
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:27,321
- Happy New Year, dirty animal!

360
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,899
and Christmas.

361
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:05,610
Maintenance

362
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,610
Pull a rud, you degenerate puppy, or you'll be a tadpole

363
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:36,769
Our honeymoon isn't too bad, is it my dear?

364
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,562
Hey, Uncle Rob lives here too!

365
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:40,202
If they come from Paris, you can go see them, they usually give good gifts

366
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:41,627
Good night mom

367
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,799
Good night Kevin

368
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:17,571
Your clothes, sir

369
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:22,414
Wow, don't show these to the whole world, are there any girls?

370
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,490
I was very careful, dance

371
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:28,143
Care should always be taken with underwear

372
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:29,143
I see

373
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:32,168
Excuse me, would you like some tea?

374
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:36,269
No need, really, there's still a balance

375
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:40,420
You don't want to, okay?

376
00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:44,166
No, no, no, no, wait a minute

377
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:49,667
The concierge will be happy to hail a taxi for you

378
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,384
Mr. McCallister!

379
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:56,721
Sorry

380
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,150
How are you feeling this morning?

381
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:05,682
I'm fine, is my car here?

382
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:13,371
It's in front of the door, sir. Limousine and pizza courtesy of our hotel.

383
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:13,943
I hope your father

384
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:18,524
realizes I was just checking last night to make sure everything was okay

385
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:20,987
Oh well pissed off!

386
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:22,034
Really?

387
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:25,240
He said he didn't come here to have his bare ass watched

388
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,134
Of course no. Will it drop soon?

389
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,382
Already gone

390
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:36,782
I would like to personally apologize

391
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,503
If a man caught you in the bathroom, would you want it?

392
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:42,800
ever see him
- I think not

393
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,608
I don't think you'll ever see him

394
00:41:46,722 --> 00:41:47,802
Well, I understand

395
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:49,995
Goodbye

396
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:54,434
Have a nice day

397
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:06,060
McCallister

398
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,193
- Good afternoon, Mr. McCallister
- Hello

399
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:33,829
Mr. McCallister, your "custom" cheese pizza, please.

400
00:42:56,382 --> 00:42:57,006
- Hello?

401
00:42:58,154 --> 00:43:00,571
- Yes
? - Do you know a good toy store?

402
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,057
- Of course, sex

403
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:14,556
<< Stolen >>

404
00:43:17,114 --> 00:43:18,471
bingo

405
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:38,855
I was rad. Get lost from here, run away. Well, who am I talking to?

406
00:43:38,856 --> 00:43:41,894
Hey, Marv, come here, there's something to talk about.

407
00:43:56,912 --> 00:44:00,723
- Does he want a scarf?
- Maybe leave that scarf, I'm saying something

408
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:03,263
Look, we don't have tools.

409
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:06,565
to do big things: a bank, a jewelry store.

410
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:11,138
We don't need them. We need cash, and now."

411
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:12,345
Hotels, huh?

412
00:44:12,544 --> 00:44:18,658
- People spend a lot of money
- No confidence, I have a better idea

413
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:22,197
Stores don't take money to the bank on Christmas Eve

414
00:44:22,197 --> 00:44:27,396
- And those stores that sell average price products will have money - That
's right

415
00:44:27,596 --> 00:44:31,166
So, which stores are going to have the most money today?

416
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,683
and no one is going to rob

417
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:35,202
Candy shops

418
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:38,965
Nine year olds steal candy

419
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:41,327
See what I mean

420
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:45,934
Brilliant, Harry, brilliant!

421
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,719
there are no other idiots

422
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:52,614
Ugh, no more idiots to rob a toy store on Christmas Day

423
00:44:52,814 --> 00:44:53,814
No, there definitely are

424
00:45:12,597 --> 00:45:15,330
Here, sir, is Duncan's chest."

425
00:45:17,035 --> 00:45:18,959
Merry Christmas, Kevin!

426
00:46:01,905 --> 00:46:04,133
This is the best accident of my life

427
00:46:22,957 --> 00:46:24,371
- Marv, Marv

428
00:46:25,058 --> 00:46:27,522
- I hear it's a cabin, it's a pity, it doesn't have a toilet

429
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,300
Huh, what's your plan?

430
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:35,080
Now everyone will go home

431
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,170
and we leave the cabin

432
00:46:40,313 --> 00:46:41,680
Here, what then?

433
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:44,371
We take the money, and come on!

434
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:45,529
It's an emergency, Harry

435
00:46:48,413 --> 00:46:52,834
Well, thanks, and Merry Christmas
- Cheers to the family

436
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:57,222
- Let me see

437
00:46:59,264 --> 00:47:00,968
Do you trade alone?

438
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:05,171
- In New York, sex, I'm afraid of my own skin

439
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:07,914
- Well, I was just checking
- You are very attentive

440
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:10,249
- Yes, thank you
- Please

441
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:14,670
Twenty-three dollars and seventy-five cents, please

442
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:21,083
Look, look, look, where did you get so much money?

443
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,665
Oh, I have a lot of grandmothers

444
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:26,871
Ha, well that explains a lot

445
00:47:29,132 --> 00:47:33,786
It is a wonderful store. Probably the best I've ever seen or been

446
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:34,914
Thank you

447
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:40,050
Mr. Duncan must be a very good man to let the children come to play

448
00:47:40,135 --> 00:47:41,552
Other places are prohibited

449
00:47:42,565 --> 00:47:44,710
- Really
? - Yes

450
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:47,470
Well, he loves children very much.

451
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,029
And you know all the money you made today?

452
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:54,414
Mr. Duncan will donate to Children's Hospital

453
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:59,736
And on Christmas morning we'll empty the cash registers, and

454
00:47:59,736 --> 00:48:02,494
Mr. Duncan will take you straight to the hospital

455
00:48:03,085 --> 00:48:04,806
That is a great generosity

456
00:48:05,751 --> 00:48:07,529
Oh, the children bring him joy

457
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:11,084
Like anyone who appreciates them

458
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:21,272
I probably shouldn't spend this, but I've got twenty dollars in my stash,

459
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:24,018
that my brother will not find. Then I will return it.

460
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:28,353
So give this please to Mr. Duncan, more at the hospital

461
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:30,429
need more than me.

462
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:35,643
I, on the other hand, will spend on something that will ruin my teeth

463
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:41,239
You are very kind, very kind

464
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:44,157
OK, do you see this tree?

465
00:48:45,036 --> 00:48:45,559
Yes

466
00:48:46,082 --> 00:48:50,141
In appreciation of your generosity, I allow you something from this tree

467
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:54,199
pick and take home
- Unsuccessful?

468
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:57,692
Do you want me to make a suggestion?

469
00:48:58,148 --> 00:48:58,620
OK

470
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:01,000
Take the pigeons

471
00:49:02,046 --> 00:49:02,957
Both of them

472
00:49:04,088 --> 00:49:05,033
Yes, both

473
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:07,919
Tell me, what can you do?

474
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:12,964
Keep one for yourself and give the other to someone very dear to you.

475
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:18,347
You know, pigeons are a sign of friendship and love

476
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:23,477
As long as you both have your pigeon,

477
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,667
you will remain friends forever

478
00:49:26,785 --> 00:49:27,645
Oh!

479
00:49:27,899 --> 00:49:30,936
What! I also thought they were song lyrics.

480
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:34,244
It is so, and precisely because of that.

481
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:38,294
Thank you

482
00:49:38,614 --> 00:49:40,049
- Merry Christmas

483
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:42,057
- Merry Christmas

484
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,246
Dress warmly before going out, it's very cold.

485
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:48,199
I will do the same.

486
00:50:25,611 --> 00:50:26,455
Where now?

487
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:31,214
You promised to take me to the Central Park Zoo.

488
00:50:38,757 --> 00:50:41,001
Hey, look who it is.

489
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:46,654
Let's get to it

490
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,265
Hey!

491
00:50:52,628 --> 00:50:53,843
What's New.

492
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:13,823
Run!

493
00:51:29,657 --> 00:51:30,657
hey

494
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:37,671
Hey, take it easy!

495
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:42,496
Buy now and avoid the queues

496
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:46,503
Two five bucks, two five bucks, four ten bucks

497
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,770
It's cool, it's cool, it's running
- Live!

498
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:52,004
- Thank you
- Congratulations, my brother.

499
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:35,415
- It was a very good offer
- Good luck, madam.

500
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,762
Help, two people have fallen behind me

501
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:52,795
What's wrong, the store won't accept it?

502
00:52:53,689 --> 00:52:55,815
Your stolen card

503
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,701
Let's see what the police say

504
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:14,209
Come back you thieving puppy!

505
00:53:17,787 --> 00:53:19,187
Stop it

506
00:53:22,394 --> 00:53:23,035
Hold on

507
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:39,414
You dirt!

508
00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:44,567
In fact, I committed fraud

509
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,862
Call security

510
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:49,748
Gotta stop the scammer

511
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,229
Let's go, Cedric

512
00:54:11,753 --> 00:54:14,588
This vacation was enough, I went home.

513
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,464
- Don't come forward

514
00:54:29,472 --> 00:54:30,974
- It's the doorman, sex

515
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:36,593
- I knew it was you. I still smelled you from the elevator.

516
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,234
You were here last night, weren't you?

517
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:47,222
- Yes, sex, I was here

518
00:54:47,222 --> 00:54:51,797
- you were here, here. You used to play syllabary with my brother.

519
00:54:53,586 --> 00:54:56,590
- Did you mix something up?

520
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:59,344
- Well, you're doing syllabic with everyone.

521
00:54:59,344 --> 00:55:04,352
Snuffy, Haley, Leo, Tobalmo, Chicky

522
00:55:04,352 --> 00:55:07,356
Bonnie Bobby, Cliffy...

523
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:12,182
- False

524
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:14,933
- False

525
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:16,620
- Shall I continue, life?

526
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:22,459
- Sorry, gender, but... but I'm afraid you're wrong

527
00:55:22,982 --> 00:55:24,997
We are looking for a young person

528
00:55:24,997 --> 00:55:29,277
- Well, well, I believe. He doesn't believe automatically.

529
00:55:30,576 --> 00:55:32,939
- Chalk my face and say you love me

530
00:55:36,685 --> 00:55:37,697
- Kneel, then, huh?

531
00:55:46,759 --> 00:55:48,464
- I love

532
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,370
- Was your imagination that big?

533
00:55:55,703 --> 00:55:57,407
- I love

534
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,877
Maybe I'm too soft, but believe me, okay.

535
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:06,435
That's why I'll let you go

536
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,559
On the count of three you disgusting!

537
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:12,076
liar, mean, lousy

538
00:56:12,076 --> 00:56:15,852
get the hell out of here

539
00:56:17,472 --> 00:56:19,357
- One
- Do it quickly, do it quickly

540
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:20,357
Two

541
00:56:34,515 --> 00:56:35,528
Three

542
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:39,139
- Happy New Year, dirty animal!

543
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:43,729
and Christmas.

544
00:56:46,564 --> 00:56:49,568
Stay in the rooms, it's an emergency.

545
00:56:50,192 --> 00:56:52,470
One of the guests is mad and armed.

546
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:10,409
Come to papa

547
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:16,201
- Return ticket to Miami - Did
you get on the wrong plane?

548
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:18,343
You won't need this either

549
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,114
You're not going to fly to the promised land, are you?
- We went

550
00:57:24,533 --> 00:57:28,810
For nine months in prison, we thought that there was no one unluckier than us in the world

551
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:31,327
We were wrong, aperik
- So

552
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:35,352
we ran away and we feel very good. Even better, because now a toy

553
00:57:35,353 --> 00:57:36,862
we rob shops, not houses

554
00:57:36,862 --> 00:57:40,888
At midnight we go to Duncan's chest, five stories of money

555
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:44,029
After that we get fake passports

556
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:46,600
call Rio

557
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:47,127
- Marv, Marv

558
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:49,946
maybe you'll cut your hair, huh
? - What's the difference, one?

559
00:57:49,946 --> 00:57:52,714
no one will see it except the fish

560
00:57:53,305 --> 00:57:56,659
or from a hole digger
- Let's take it to a subway tunnel

561
00:57:56,659 --> 00:57:59,498
I'll feel a lot better when we get him locked up

562
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:06,957
- Look, there is a weapon in my pocket. If you open your mouth, I will remove the chewing gum from your forehead

563
00:58:27,814 --> 00:58:28,814
Greetings

564
00:58:32,607 --> 00:58:33,315
It was himself

565
00:58:34,412 --> 00:58:35,307
What

566
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:39,795
Thank you

567
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,257
- Got up
- Went to the park

568
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:47,257
- What did your lover catch?

569
00:59:22,337 --> 00:59:22,675
Over there

570
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:37,424
- Hey, come on. I caught it
- I 'll see

571
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:41,229
This is not him, take him down, he is not.
Must die, as many chances as possible

572
00:59:41,229 --> 00:59:43,483
I don't want to start any business

573
00:59:43,483 --> 00:59:46,487
because it is free
- What should it do?

574
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:49,671
It's a child, children are helpless
- This is not one

575
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,495
But this time he has no home, full of dangerous things

576
00:59:52,495 --> 00:59:57,252
In a park, alone, kids are afraid of parks

577
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:02,280
Hey, big people come to the park and don't come back alive

578
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,782
Try your luck

579
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:16,455
I want a house

580
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:19,020
Where are you, mom?

581
01:00:50,054 --> 01:00:50,880
Turn off the sound

582
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:54,543
-
Hello? - Kate McCulster?

583
01:00:54,544 --> 01:00:55,821
- Yes
? - We found your son

584
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:57,857
- Oh my God
- What?

585
01:00:58,043 --> 01:00:59,786
- Do they know where Kevin
is - Where?

586
01:01:01,613 --> 01:01:03,843
- In New York
- New York?

587
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:05,114
- What?

588
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:10,357
- He's definitely scared, he can't create problems
- What, what?

589
01:01:10,514 --> 01:01:12,700
- One second, please
- What?

590
01:01:12,818 --> 01:01:15,147
- Your credit card was registered at the Plaza Hotel

591
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:16,345
- And is it there now?

592
01:01:16,952 --> 01:01:17,256
- Is it there?

593
01:01:18,214 --> 01:01:20,243
- No, they are still looking for
- Take the writer

594
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,643
- Come to New York
- On the next flight, thank you

595
01:01:23,771 --> 01:01:25,586
We're going to New York, move!

596
01:01:25,671 --> 01:01:27,071
- Yes!

597
01:01:28,022 --> 01:01:31,313
He ran away from the hotel when he was caught. Perhaps he is terrified.

598
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:34,047
Maybe he will go to my brother's house

599
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,076
isn't it in paris

600
01:01:35,498 --> 01:01:36,713
Maybe there is someone watching at home

601
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:38,316
But wasn't it a repair?

602
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:19,930
Hey!

603
01:02:21,685 --> 01:02:22,680
Uncle Rob!

604
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,937
Aunt Georgette! is there anyone at home

605
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:28,300
Hey!

606
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:32,940
Is there anyone at home? Kevin is your favorite cousin

607
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,759
Uncle Rob!

608
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:37,784
Aunt Georgette!

609
01:02:59,704 --> 01:03:04,750
No, no... A... yes, yes... no, no...

610
01:03:21,152 --> 01:03:22,722
Be careful, boy

611
01:03:30,045 --> 01:03:34,619
Hey, looking for someone to tell you a bedtime story?

612
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:39,850
Taxi

613
01:03:53,738 --> 01:03:55,257
It's going to be scary outside

614
01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:59,374
There is nothing here either, brother

615
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,247
That's it, I don't want such holidays

616
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:02,899
Where did you come from, there won't be enough of you all?

617
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:05,543
How hungry are you?

618
01:05:06,722 --> 01:05:09,068
That's it, you ate all my food

619
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:13,885
Sorry for yelling in your face. You were trying to help me, weren't you?

620
01:06:17,412 --> 01:06:19,099
My name is Kevin McCallister

621
01:06:20,297 --> 01:06:21,782
You have very nice birds

622
01:06:22,997 --> 01:06:24,162
I saw you again

623
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:28,029
you were completely covered in pigeons

624
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:32,600
You'd be a little scared at first, but now that I think about it, it's not so bad

625
01:06:32,601 --> 01:06:35,924
They definitely love you that they surrounded you like that

626
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:37,307
Am I disturbing you?

627
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:39,653
can i go

628
01:06:41,492 --> 01:06:41,883
No

629
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:45,795
Well, it's good. Aren't I disgusted?

630
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:48,833
No

631
01:06:54,098 --> 01:06:57,507
And do the pigeons return by themselves or do you have to call them?

632
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,842
Give me your hand

633
01:07:13,538 --> 01:07:14,753
They listen

634
01:07:32,759 --> 01:07:33,839
It is wonderful

635
01:07:38,445 --> 01:07:42,124
It's cold, isn't it? I would drink hot chocolate if I was lucky

636
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:43,322
And you

637
01:07:44,082 --> 01:07:44,959
I treat you

638
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:54,481
I wouldn't want to spend Christmas Eve in a park like that. Shall we go somewhere warm?

639
01:07:54,481 --> 01:07:57,042
Yes, I know where

640
01:08:44,275 --> 01:08:45,827
What good music!

641
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:49,624
Wonderful place

642
01:08:50,384 --> 01:08:55,495
I listen to the best music in the world in this room

643
01:08:55,695 --> 01:08:57,353
Ella Fitzgerald, Caruso

644
01:08:57,775 --> 01:08:58,720
Frank Sinatra

645
01:08:59,547 --> 01:09:00,998
Luciano Pavarotti

646
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,790
Well, aren't you bringing your friends here?

647
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:12,085
I don't have many friends

648
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:14,127
Sorry

649
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:17,434
I am like the birds I take care of

650
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:22,935
People avoid me, they see me and ignore me

651
01:09:22,986 --> 01:09:25,889
Maybe they'd rather I wasn't part of their town

652
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,892
Yes, something like that runs in my family

653
01:09:28,892 --> 01:09:32,520
I am also the pigeon of our house, just because I am small

654
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,170
Everyone's fighting for a place

655
01:09:35,744 --> 01:09:38,612
People want to be noticed and heard

656
01:09:39,203 --> 01:09:41,014
yes maybe but

657
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:44,637
Yes, maybe. But I was well seen and heard. And basically sent to my room

658
01:09:47,775 --> 01:09:49,345
I haven't always been like this

659
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:51,859
Oh, and how have you been?

660
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:55,639
I had a job

661
01:09:56,837 --> 01:09:57,495
family

662
01:09:58,019 --> 01:09:58,879
Children?

663
01:10:00,246 --> 01:10:00,955
I didn't have it

664
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:03,503
But I wanted to

665
01:10:04,887 --> 01:10:06,068
And the one I loved

666
01:10:06,557 --> 01:10:07,739
stop loving me

667
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:10,962
My heart broke

668
01:10:11,856 --> 01:10:16,379
And when there was an opportunity to be loved again, I avoided it

669
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:19,045
I stopped trusting people

670
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:22,875
No offense, but I think you did something wrong

671
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,947
I was afraid that my heart would be broken again

672
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:30,435
Sometimes you trust a person, and then when something goes wrong,

673
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,891


674
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,220
they forget you

675
01:10:34,823 --> 01:10:37,598
And maybe they are too busy, maybe

676
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:40,122
they don't forget you, but they forget to remember you

677
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:45,945
People don't want to forget, it just happens that way. My grandfather says if

678
01:10:45,945 --> 01:10:49,454
if my head wasn't stuck I would have forgotten on the school bus

679
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:52,457
If I trust someone, my heart will be broken again

680
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:56,602
I see. I had a lot of cute licks.

681
01:10:56,602 --> 01:10:59,865
but I was so afraid of breaking it that I kept it in a box

682
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:03,176
Do you know what happened? They got smaller.

683
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:06,953
Don't wear it outside anyway, only in my room

684
01:11:07,274 --> 01:11:08,303
Several times

685
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:13,889
The human heart and emotions are different from the Glicks

686
01:11:15,306 --> 01:11:17,162
It's about the same

687
01:11:17,348 --> 01:11:22,399
If you don't use your heart, who cares if it gets broken?

688
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:24,925
If you keep only yourself, it will look like my licks

689
01:11:25,212 --> 01:11:27,810
If you decide to try one more day, it won't work

690
01:11:28,992 --> 01:11:31,658
It is necessary to use the opportunity. There is nothing to lose.

691
01:11:32,535 --> 01:11:34,864
There is truth in what you say

692
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,973
I think yes. A heart can be broken

693
01:11:38,973 --> 01:11:40,480
but still there.

694
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,247
If it wasn't, you wouldn't be so kind.

695
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:51,351
Thank you. You know, I haven't talked to anyone in a few years.

696
01:11:52,178 --> 01:11:53,174
no one.

697
01:11:53,292 --> 01:11:55,295
It's okay, it works out well.

698
01:11:55,295 --> 01:12:00,302
You are not boring. You don't mutter or spit. Try more often.

699
01:12:00,302 --> 01:12:04,058
Just dress so that your clothes don't look old.

700
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:10,302
It turns out that I worked to keep people away, huh?
- I always thought that

701
01:12:10,302 --> 01:12:13,413
I will spend more pleasant time alone

702
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:15,617
but when I am alone, it is not happy at all.

703
01:12:15,617 --> 01:12:18,149
No matter how many

704
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:21,945
disgusts me, I'd rather be with a friend than alone.

705
01:12:22,452 --> 01:12:27,227
Then what are you doing alone on the streets on Christmas night? Do you have a problem?

706
01:12:28,476 --> 01:12:30,653
- Yes
- Did you do something wrong?

707
01:12:31,109 --> 01:12:32,003
Full thing

708
01:12:34,905 --> 01:12:39,057
Do you know that good deeds wash away bad deeds?

709
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,829
It is already a little late.

710
01:12:40,947 --> 01:12:44,828
There is no time to do enough good work to clean up all the bad ones.

711
01:12:46,043 --> 01:12:50,954
It's Christmas, good deeds are worth more today.
- Really?

712
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,763
Of course. Think about what important thing you can do for others.

713
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:56,843
and do.

714
01:12:58,227 --> 01:13:00,555
Follow the star in your heart.

715
01:13:02,547 --> 01:13:03,137
Very good.

716
01:13:04,994 --> 01:13:06,985
It's already late, maybe I should go.

717
01:13:14,629 --> 01:13:17,903
If I don't see you again, I hope everything will be fine.

718
01:13:18,274 --> 01:13:19,034
Thank you.

719
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:23,100
Say goodbye to the pigeons from me
- I will

720
01:13:31,977 --> 01:13:34,942
- Merry Christmas
- Merry Christmas!

721
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,253
If you need someone to confide in:

722
01:13:37,254 --> 01:13:41,275
I can be that one. I will not forget to remember you.

723
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:43,890
Do not promise what you cannot do.

724
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:48,086
Mr. Duncan will donate all money earned today to the children's hospital

725
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:51,998
We're going to loot Duncan's chest at midnight

726
01:14:53,162 --> 01:14:57,550
You can spoil anything, but not the children's Christmas

727
01:17:18,827 --> 01:17:21,841
We can offer you a nice room on the top floor:

728
01:17:21,841 --> 01:17:24,101
With a view of a park in New York.

729
01:17:24,101 --> 01:17:26,110
I think you will like it.

730
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:29,374
The Countess of Wales has just released it.

731
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,113
Which hotel registers a child alone?

732
01:17:33,114 --> 01:17:36,314
The boy made up a very believable story.

733
01:17:36,315 --> 01:17:40,647
And what kind of idiots work here.
- The best in New York.

734
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:46,249
Well, when you discover that your credit card has been stolen...
- I was the discoverer

735
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:48,359
How did you let him get away?

736
01:17:49,084 --> 01:17:52,560
When we tried to stop him, he ran away
- Because you scared him

737
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:57,539
It's Christmas night, and because of you, our child is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world.

738
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:02,468
Please escort my family to the room.

739
01:18:02,468 --> 01:18:06,487
- Yes, sex
- Move over, Cedric

740
01:18:06,487 --> 01:18:11,511
I'll go to the police to make sure they're doing everything they can to find Kevin. Please stay with Franken.

741
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:14,819
No, I'm going to look for my son
- What?

742
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:19,392
With all due respect, ma'am, but a child is missing in one of the world's greatest cities

743
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:23,459
- Will you not interfere
? - Of course

744
01:18:23,475 --> 01:18:28,116
Thank you.
I don't think it's a good idea to run around New York alone

745
01:18:28,825 --> 01:18:31,440
If Kevin can do it, so can I
- Kate

746
01:18:31,727 --> 01:18:35,676
Nothing will happen to me. From my appearance, no thief or robber would dare to approach me

747
01:18:36,604 --> 01:18:40,165
Well, ma'am, there are hundreds of porters out there, armed with a...

748
01:18:42,612 --> 01:18:44,569
Dress up, it's very cold outside.

749
01:19:20,294 --> 01:19:22,285
Marv, Marv, let's go!

750
01:19:43,868 --> 01:19:44,408
Marv?

751
01:19:45,589 --> 01:19:46,315
Cheers!

752
01:19:53,014 --> 01:19:55,731
Merry Christmas
- Come on!

753
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:01,452
Happy Hanukkah, Marv!

754
01:20:11,509 --> 01:20:13,922
There's more money here than I can count

755
01:20:14,817 --> 01:20:18,209
Now I think, what business were we robbing houses?

756
01:20:32,265 --> 01:20:36,092
The surprising thing is that we ran away from the law up to our elbows in money.

757
01:20:36,092 --> 01:20:38,897
and no one even knows about it

758
01:20:43,943 --> 01:20:44,837
It's back

759
01:20:46,845 --> 01:20:47,774
He drew

760
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:49,461
How did I look?

761
01:20:56,211 --> 01:20:58,439
That's it, no step back.

762
01:20:59,502 --> 01:21:01,712
Another Christmas in the trenches.

763
01:21:13,677 --> 01:21:15,429
"...don't leave them, don't take money,

764
01:21:15,429 --> 01:21:19,684
շուտ․․․"

765
01:21:24,409 --> 01:21:26,046
I am coming

766
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,036
right?

767
01:21:39,512 --> 01:21:42,432
Harry, it was excellent.

768
01:21:45,371 --> 01:21:46,371
Where is that?

769
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,152
Twisted my leg huh?

770
01:21:49,418 --> 01:21:51,089
Hey guys, smile!

771
01:21:54,683 --> 01:21:59,155
Get up, help, let's go
- I caught it, I caught it

772
01:22:26,695 --> 01:22:27,302
Taxi!

773
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:34,710
Town Square

774
01:22:57,357 --> 01:22:58,065
Where did he go?

775
01:22:59,331 --> 01:23:01,457
Hey guys, smile!

776
01:23:03,769 --> 01:23:05,529
Let's kill!

777
01:23:05,529 --> 01:23:09,552
Wait, you brainless. We got caught that time because we underestimated

778
01:23:09,552 --> 01:23:13,575
that pitiful puppy
- Not like that now. This is not his house.

779
01:23:13,575 --> 01:23:16,341
Now he runs away scared, he has no plans

780
01:23:16,763 --> 01:23:20,273
Will you please let me be the thinker?

781
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:21,842
Thank you

782
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,391
Boy
- I'm listening

783
01:23:27,391 --> 01:23:30,906
Nothing would give me more pleasure than

784
01:23:30,906 --> 01:23:33,417
killing you.
Some puppy

785
01:23:33,417 --> 01:23:37,936
it's not a big deal for me to get drunk, you know
- Uh ?

786
01:23:37,936 --> 01:23:40,447
But, since we are late, we want to make an appointment

787
01:23:40,447 --> 01:23:43,962
with you.
You drop the camera, so do we

788
01:23:43,962 --> 01:23:47,729
we are not harming you. you won't hear about us either.

789
01:23:48,674 --> 01:23:51,104
- Okay
? - Do you promise?

790
01:23:52,133 --> 01:23:55,795
I cross my heart. Am I going to die or am I lying?

791
01:23:55,913 --> 01:23:56,824
Alright.

792
01:24:03,152 --> 01:24:05,295
All right, kid, throw it away

793
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,914
At the destination

794
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:24,201
How many fingers am I pointing at, Marv?

795
01:24:26,314 --> 01:24:27,371
Eight

796
01:24:30,486 --> 01:24:31,886
Oh that's right, puppy!

797
01:24:31,971 --> 01:24:38,043
Do you want to throw a stone? Well, throw it away, soon.
- No, no, don't do it, no.

798
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:44,029
If you don't have anything from that, you're definitely done

799
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,357
Harry, no!

800
01:24:54,986 --> 01:24:55,945
Do you have any more?

801
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,443
Get up, he doesn't have it either. That's it. It's dirty.

802
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:10,143
What?

803
01:25:11,986 --> 01:25:12,529
What?

804
01:25:16,057 --> 01:25:17,014
What?

805
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:24,214
You are finished. Whoever throws a stone at him will not live.

806
01:25:24,343 --> 01:25:26,257
Get up. You on this side, I on the back.

807
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:38,057
Harry? Harry! Harry!

808
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:02,686
Huh?

809
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:38,386
I'll kill you, huh!

810
01:27:10,843 --> 01:27:16,729
Well, now you will see what I will do.
A minute, a minute.

811
01:27:32,029 --> 01:27:38,014
Look what I have to do to you. "Ab right in my mouth" Marv.

812
01:28:03,929 --> 01:28:06,686
Harry, I'm mad.

813
01:28:27,643 --> 01:28:33,143
Well, look, well, look at what I'm going to do. Now you will see what I will do to you.

814
01:28:43,286 --> 01:28:49,186
Well, look, well, look. I'm going to finish you now, look.

815
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,229
I'll kill you, puppy

816
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:30,014
Wow! You are a ruin

817
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,557
Harry

818
01:34:00,729 --> 01:34:02,814
I'm going up

819
01:34:17,229 --> 01:34:19,909
I'm going to slaughter that puppy

820
01:34:37,886 --> 01:34:38,943
yes

821
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:15,986
Don't you know that a child can always be defeated by two tricks?
- Harry, he is going to the hall

822
01:35:17,529 --> 01:35:20,286
Climbs the stairs

823
01:35:36,357 --> 01:35:38,500
I'm coming, Harry

824
01:35:38,771 --> 01:35:39,943
I came

825
01:35:45,086 --> 01:35:47,671
Harry!
Harry!

826
01:35:48,314 --> 01:35:52,844
Hey, you haven't lost any teeth, see

827
01:35:53,044 --> 01:35:55,563
Hey, don't you want the stairs?

828
01:35:55,614 --> 01:35:57,186
Come on, go to the second floor

829
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:02,032
A minute, a minute.

830
01:36:02,232 --> 01:36:04,900
Don't you remember last year?

831
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,200
No

832
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,943
Well, look

833
01:36:08,743 --> 01:36:10,632
Let's go catch it

834
01:36:15,171 --> 01:36:18,832
- Oh, right in my mouth. Ah!

835
01:36:19,614 --> 01:36:20,743
This one.

836
01:36:20,943 --> 01:36:25,964
"Don't worry, Harry, I'll catch you."

837
01:36:32,457 --> 01:36:35,214
Straight nose to nose

838
01:36:35,571 --> 01:36:38,895
This is two. Here we go now.

839
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,701
Three more.

840
01:36:59,629 --> 01:37:01,102
Not again!

841
01:37:02,657 --> 01:37:04,671
This is four.

842
01:37:09,314 --> 01:37:10,714
Come on, Harry!

843
01:37:10,971 --> 01:37:15,943
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Ha, ha. We will see now.

844
01:37:16,086 --> 01:37:17,814
Solid as a rock

845
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:39,886
- Like a rock, huh
?

846
01:37:40,086 --> 01:37:41,643
When?

847
01:37:53,186 --> 01:38:00,114
- It would be good to say all the prayers
you know - Your parents would also do well to slowly start ordering your tombstone

848
01:38:01,057 --> 01:38:02,500
Where did he go?

849
01:38:02,614 --> 01:38:06,371
I'm upstairs. I'm scared.

850
01:38:15,186 --> 01:38:16,500
What's the sound?

851
01:38:36,957 --> 01:38:44,271
It was the sound of the toolbox rolling down the stairs -
Ha!

852
01:38:49,314 --> 01:38:50,057
yes

853
01:39:24,657 --> 01:39:26,157
Over there

854
01:39:26,529 --> 01:39:30,500
I will kill you even if I get an electric shock

855
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,543
Give it up, boy!

856
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:37,914
Gone
- I'm down you fools

857
01:39:42,257 --> 01:39:44,414
" in decay

858
01:39:46,857 --> 01:39:48,114
Well eat it, puppy!

859
01:39:54,143 --> 01:39:57,400
- Come on, Marv
- I don't know

860
01:39:57,814 --> 01:39:59,486
I said come on

861
01:40:01,071 --> 01:40:03,197
Come on you coward!

862
01:40:16,843 --> 01:40:18,186
Harry?

863
01:40:19,071 --> 01:40:24,447
- Do you sprinkle perfume -
No perfume, it's kerosene, the rope is impregnated with it

864
01:40:24,647 --> 01:40:28,643
But who needed to soak the rope in kerosene?

865
01:40:32,557 --> 01:40:34,757
Merry Christmas

866
01:40:35,587 --> 01:40:37,714
Up, up, soon!

867
01:40:46,243 --> 01:40:47,143
Up

868
01:41:11,186 --> 01:41:12,843
Get up

869
01:41:36,171 --> 01:41:37,243
Bring the bag

870
01:41:38,814 --> 01:41:45,843
Hello to you. The two that robbed Duncan's trunk are in Central Park, West Side, Ninety-fifth Street.

871
01:41:46,057 --> 01:41:47,478
Come to the fireworks.

872
01:41:53,371 --> 01:41:57,844
Hey, I'm here. You will do well to catch me, how many times have I called the police?

873
01:42:11,971 --> 01:42:15,457
See how elusive luck is

874
01:42:15,571 --> 01:42:17,129
"Do you like it?

875
01:42:22,914 --> 01:42:25,743
Let's go to the park for a while

876
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:45,574
Give me the bag. Give me.

877
01:42:49,314 --> 01:42:53,186
Hey, whatever will look good on the album

878
01:42:53,443 --> 01:42:58,400
You won the battle, but you got carried away in the war, aperik

879
01:42:58,571 --> 01:43:02,914
They don't fall with us, dear boy. We are dangerous.

880
01:43:07,543 --> 01:43:09,729
- Harry
? - Your voice?

881
01:43:14,671 --> 01:43:18,957
- Harry
- Yours. Let me enjoy this moment

882
01:43:19,143 --> 01:43:22,229
There is one thing. Let's fly from here.

883
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:24,043
I say your voice.

884
01:43:25,614 --> 01:43:31,343
I didn't even go to the sixth grade. Maybe you won't go either.

885
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,243
Let the boy.

886
01:43:34,557 --> 01:43:36,707
Kevin, run!

887
01:43:36,907 --> 01:43:40,557
Shoot him. Shoot this.

888
01:43:41,057 --> 01:43:44,229
- Shoot
- I'm trying, idiot

889
01:44:23,671 --> 01:44:25,900
Goodbye! Thank you.

890
01:44:51,471 --> 01:44:55,529
- Oh, something like Independence Day
- Quick, quick

891
01:44:55,743 --> 01:44:59,273
- We are a bridge, you are a tunnel
- Well, get up, walk

892
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,457
Oh my God.

893
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,843
Stop, quick!

894
01:45:25,457 --> 01:45:30,979
Hey guys, you should start early. The prisoners have already received the gifts.

895
01:45:31,229 --> 01:45:36,843
Are we late for the gifts? He forced us to hide in the store and steal the children's money

896
01:45:37,029 --> 01:45:38,743
Your voice, Marv.

897
01:45:39,843 --> 01:45:43,120
You have the right to remain silent, don't you know?

898
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:47,987
- It's a bit annoying. We just escaped from prison, huh
! - Your voice, Marv

899
01:45:48,187 --> 01:45:50,256
Take these

900
01:45:50,371 --> 01:45:57,157
- If you write about this, remember: we are not the wet bandits anymore, we are the sticky bandits
- Your Voice

901
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:02,400
- You remember, don't you? K P... Sticky. No.

902
01:46:15,871 --> 01:46:20,643
Well, Mr. Danken, we are done. We found the bandits and returned your money.

903
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:24,386
I want to take that money to the children's hospital as soon as possible

904
01:46:24,557 --> 01:46:27,100
- I'll take care of that
- Yeah, thanks

905
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,080
- Sorry, Mr. Duncan
- Yes?

906
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:32,171
I found a new note, as if a child broke the window

907
01:46:32,543 --> 01:46:37,843
Dear Mr. Danken, I broke your window to catch the criminals. Are you insured?

908
01:46:38,043 --> 01:46:42,314
If not, I will send the money for it if I ever get to Chicago.

909
01:46:42,486 --> 01:46:44,700
Merry Christmas.
Kevin McCallister.

910
01:46:44,871 --> 01:46:47,514
Postscript: greetings for pigeons.

911
01:46:48,186 --> 01:46:51,214
Pigeons.

912
01:47:00,429 --> 01:47:04,070
Excuse me, I'm looking for my son, in this picture...

913
01:47:05,514 --> 01:47:11,040
Please, help, please.
Do you know the guy in the picture?

914
01:47:18,486 --> 01:47:22,571
I am looking for my son. It's gone for two days

915
01:47:22,729 --> 01:47:24,904
- Did you leave a message
- Yes, of course

916
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:30,229
So trust us. We will deal with that issue.

917
01:47:34,243 --> 01:47:41,800
- I am the boy's mother
- I understood that, madam, but there is no point in looking for a needle in the haystack.

918
01:47:41,957 --> 01:47:44,857
- Do you have children
- Yes, ma'am

919
01:47:45,114 --> 01:47:47,543
- What would you do if one was lost?

920
01:47:49,071 --> 01:47:51,428
- Probably the same as you now

921
01:47:53,143 --> 01:47:55,057
- Thank you

922
01:47:57,486 --> 01:48:05,109
- Look, imagine yourself in his place. What would you do? Where would you go?
- Me? I would probably have fallen in one of the streams, I would have died.

923
01:48:06,129 --> 01:48:11,571
But not Kevin. He is much stronger and braver than me.

924
01:48:12,686 --> 01:48:16,371
And I know that now it is good. Just still alone in the giant city

925
01:48:16,571 --> 01:48:18,743
He doesn't deserve it

926
01:48:20,929 --> 01:48:28,714
He should be at home, with his family, near the Christmas tree. Do you understand?

927
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,086
oh my God

928
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:35,157
I seem to know where it is

929
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:38,543
Gotta go to Rockwell Center
- Get in the car

930
01:48:38,857 --> 01:48:40,371
Thank you

931
01:48:44,429 --> 01:48:48,630
I know I don't deserve Christmas even if I did a good job

932
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:55,800
I don't want gifts. Instead, I want to take back all the words I said to my family.

933
01:48:56,029 --> 01:49:03,481
Even if they don't do the same, I love them all. Including Baz.

934
01:49:03,681 --> 01:49:07,476
If I can't see them, can I at least see my mother?

935
01:49:07,676 --> 01:49:12,030
I will never want anything again. I only want my mother.

936
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:21,671
I know, it won't happen like this. But promise that I will see you again. One day. Any day. At least once. At least for a few minutes.

937
01:49:21,871 --> 01:49:24,559
I apologize

938
01:49:33,686 --> 01:49:34,543
How much?

939
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,006
Mom?

940
01:49:44,343 --> 01:49:46,656
That fast?

941
01:49:57,857 --> 01:49:58,943
Oh Kevin!

942
01:50:00,129 --> 01:50:02,429
Mom, I'm sorry

943
01:50:03,971 --> 01:50:05,791
You will forgive me too

944
01:50:18,414 --> 01:50:24,378
- Merry Christmas, Mom
- Merry Christmas, my dear

945
01:50:24,578 --> 01:50:26,682
Thank you

946
01:50:26,882 --> 01:50:28,700
Let's go

947
01:50:30,014 --> 01:50:34,400
- How did you know that I am here?
- I know the connection between you and the Christmas tree, and this is the biggest one

948
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:39,357
- Where are the rest
? - In the hotel. They didn't like the palm trees either

949
01:51:22,757 --> 01:51:28,943
Oh, you wonder! It is already morning.
It's Christmas morning

950
01:51:29,557 --> 01:51:32,829
- Fuller, don't get your hopes up
- Huh?

951
01:51:33,029 --> 01:51:40,543
- I don't think Santa enters hotels
- Are you smart? He is everywhere and goes everywhere

952
01:51:41,629 --> 01:51:45,163
Get up, it's Christmas!

953
01:51:47,643 --> 01:51:50,715
Mom, Dad, it's Christmas

954
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:08,701
- Where did all this come from?
- Hey, dad, you have to see this

955
01:52:11,771 --> 01:52:13,757
A miracle to you, Pitt?

956
01:52:14,886 --> 01:52:17,800
Are we in the right room?

957
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:24,252
Don't open mine, I'm serious

958
01:52:24,452 --> 01:52:27,063
Who is Mr. Duncan
- Duncan? I don't know

959
01:52:27,263 --> 01:52:31,871
Everyone calm down, shut up, I say, eh, eh

960
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:42,403
Okay, now. If Kevin hadn't lost his taste, we wouldn't be in this extraordinary and huge number again.

961
01:52:42,603 --> 01:52:44,814
a wagon full of freebies

962
01:52:45,029 --> 01:52:50,114
So I think it's only fair if Kevin opens first

963
01:52:50,535 --> 01:52:53,609
Then me. Then all of them.

964
01:52:57,971 --> 01:53:00,440
Merry Christmas, Kev!

965
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,778
Merry Christmas, Buzz!

966
01:53:02,978 --> 01:53:06,211
Merry Christmas, Kevin!

967
01:53:06,411 --> 01:53:09,533
Hey Kevin, cool, congrats!

968
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:17,978
Well, enough of feelings.
Let's see what is there.

969
01:53:18,178 --> 01:53:23,111
People, keep the papers, we will use them next year. The threads too.

970
01:54:00,371 --> 01:54:03,443
Merry Christmas

971
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:06,439
Merry Christmas Kevin!

972
01:54:07,629 --> 01:54:09,545
I have something for you

973
01:54:17,386 --> 01:54:18,576
What is this

974
01:54:18,776 --> 01:54:20,460
Pigeon

975
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:22,600
I have one, you have one

976
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:27,050
As long as they are with us, we will be friends forever

977
01:54:31,214 --> 01:54:32,926
Oh, Kevin!

978
01:54:35,757 --> 01:54:37,491
Thank you

979
01:54:37,691 --> 01:54:40,837
I will not forget you, be sure.

980
01:55:08,371 --> 01:55:11,568
Fee for Mr. McCallister's services

981
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:14,625
Merry Christmas

982
01:55:15,843 --> 01:55:18,139
Ha, um, ha...

983
01:55:21,143 --> 01:55:22,784
What a nice family

984
01:55:32,043 --> 01:55:34,897
Whew. Merry Christmas....

985
01:55:36,171 --> 01:55:37,913
Dad!

986
01:55:38,113 --> 01:55:44,416
Kevin, did you spend nine hundred and sixty seven dollars on services alone?
