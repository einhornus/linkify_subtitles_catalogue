1
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:34,593
Villages near Moscow: Troparevo, Chertanovo,

2
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:39,200
Medvedkovo, Belyaevo-Bogorodskoye, and, of course, Cheryomushki

3
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:42,674
they did not know that they were gaining immortality

4
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:44,641
in those sad days for them,

5
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:47,636
when they are swept off the face of the earth forever.

6
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:54,155
The village of Cheryomushki gave its name to Moscow's new buildings,

7
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:59,079
which are located in the south-west of our capital .

8
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:03,719
Now almost in any Soviet city

9
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,953
there are their Cheryomushki.

10
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:11,514
In the old days, when a person found himself in an unfamiliar city,

11
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:14,754
he felt lonely and lost.

12
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:18,995
Everything was strange: houses, streets, and even life

13
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:21,233
But now it's a completely different matter.

14
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,076
A man finds himself in an unfamiliar city,

15
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:26,916
but he feels at home in it.

16
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:32,154
To what absurdity our ancestors reached.

17
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:35,872
They agonized over every architectural project.

18
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:38,431
And now all cities are being built

19
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:42,231
typical movie theater "Raketa", where you can watch

20
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:44,836
a typical feature film .

21
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:50,152
-And you have some oranges -Oranges are there.

22
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:55,994
Everyone to the fair here, There are toys and firecrackers,

23
00:06:56,241 --> 00:07:01,269
We have a lot of gifts here, Come to us, friends .

24
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:05,956
Street names are also not very diverse.

25
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,591
Which city doesn't have a 1st Sadovaya or 2nd Zagorodnaya street?,

26
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:14,710
3rd Factory, 1st Park, 2nd Industrial,

27
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:18,1000
3rd Street Builders! Beautiful, isn't it?

28
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:21,511
Identical staircases cells

29
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:24,149
painted in a typical color colour.

30
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,029
Standard apartments are furnished standard furniture,

31
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,273
and the faceless doors are cut in typical locks.

32
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,833
Zhenechka, I have a question for you an unexpected offer.

33
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,399
Really?

34
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,759
Do not be afraid.

35
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,788
Zhen, let's meet New Year's Eve together?

36
00:07:48,1000 --> 00:07:53,437
Together, of course. We're getting together.

37
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,874
No.

38
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,271
You did not understand. Let's all be together, eh?

39
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,670
Is it like "not at all" ? I don't understand.

40
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,952
We won't go to the Katanyans.

41
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,229
No, Galya, this is inconvenient. We agreed

42
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:13,948
These are my friends . And you I made a crab salad.

43
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,315
I love crabs so much !

44
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,308
All the more so! Let's eat them together.

45
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,069
Where are we going to eat them?

46
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,310
How incomprehensible you are!

47
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,993
We'll meet you here, at your place.

48
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,594
Right here?

49
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,831
What about the Katanas?

50
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,547
Oleg offers to meet new year

51
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,074
in the Ostankino Tower restaurant.

52
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,991
Give me an aunt.

53
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,636
"It's spinning. "Who?"

54
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,357
The restaurant rotates.

55
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:52,038
Well, if you want to spin, then of course you do.

56
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,871
I want to celebrate the New Year with you.

57
00:08:57,678 --> 00:09:00,351
Really? Come on!

58
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,428
"How stupid! "Who else are we going to call?"

59
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,987
That's the trick, no one.

60
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:13,387
Wait, what's "no one" ? And my mother? With us will meet

61
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:17,032
And my mother will leave. Everything will be prepared,

62
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,396
She'll set the table, and I'll help her. You have a world mother!

63
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:26,956
Great idea! Why didn't I figure it out myself?

64
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:30,189
But someone has to be smart, right?

65
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,474
"It'll be you ." - Eugene, stop it!

66
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:36,277
What about Katanyans ? I don't understand...

67
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:41,029
Oleg offers to meet me new year

68
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:42,869
in Suzdal in the monastery!

69
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:45,995
To hell with Oleg! To hell with the monastery

70
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,756
I don't want to go to a monastery I want to be with you.

71
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:53,516
With me?

72
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:09,551
Excuse me, how do I get to 3rd Stroiteley Street?

73
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:13,027
The face of the Builders behind those tall buildings.

74
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:16,074
"You'll see a church there-thank you."

75
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:25,185
We will meet New Year's Eve together. You and me.

76
00:10:26,196 --> 00:10:27,675
I'll have a drink ...

77
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,791
Razbuyanus, raskhrabryu. ..

78
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,833
And finally, I'll tell you everything I have to say

79
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:39,395
Eugene!

80
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:45,188
Are you really going to ask me to marry you?"

81
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:48,504
After two years of dating...

82
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:58,033
Let's wait until the New Year, the chimes must strike ...

83
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,266
Let's wait...

84
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:06,552
It's just that I'm afraid that you have never have the guts.

85
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:12,825
This is cowardice .. the old one a bachelor.

86
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:17,947
You know, I already did proposal to one woman.

87
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:21,904
To my great surprise, she agreed

88
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:24,666
But when I imagined,

89
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:27,382
that she will live in my apartment. the room,

90
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:31,390
And every day. ..

91
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:35,432
Flash before my eyes with your eyes...

92
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,985
Back and forth, back and forth...

93
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:42,552
I couldn't stand it and ran away to Leningrad.

94
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:48,028
And you'll run away from me, too

95
00:11:48,914 --> 00:11:51,872
No, I can't run away from you.

96
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:57,586
Everything is finally decided and irrevocably.

97
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:02,793
Held on, held on and collapsed.

98
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:06,542
Zhenya...

99
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:13,584
What do you think, when do people sing?

100
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,261
Singing?

101
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:19,753
When? At demonstrations.

102
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,946
- So... And what else? "They sing at the opera.

103
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:25,504
When they drink, they sing.

104
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:28,070
You idiot! Do you know when people sing?

105
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,669
- When there is no hearing or voice?- no.

106
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:35,667
"When they're happy ." "That's right.

107
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:53,664
No one will be in the house,

108
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,628
Except for twilight,

109
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,746
One winter day

110
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:05,624
In a through opening Uncluttered curtains,

111
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:09,070
Uncluttered curtain.

112
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:17,268
Only white wet lumps

113
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,582
Quick flash of the flywheel,

114
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:26,667
Only roofs, snow, etc.

115
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:29,471
No roofs or snow,

116
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:32,783
No roofs or snow.

117
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,467
And again it will draw frost,

118
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:42,025
And then he'll spin me around again

119
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:47,903
Last year's gloom And the affairs of winter are different,

120
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:52,740
And the business of winter is different.

121
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:59,304
But unexpectedly on the curtain A shiver of intrusion will run through you,

122
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:03,340
Measuring the silence with your steps, Measure the silence with your steps,

123
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:09,460
Measuring the silence with your steps, You, as the future, will enter.

124
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,663
You'll show up at the door,

125
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,419
In something white, without quirks,

126
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,629
It's really one of those things,

127
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,750
From which flakes are sewn,

128
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,150
From which flakes are sewn.

129
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,902
No one will be in the house,

130
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,420
Except for twilight,

131
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,787
One winter day In a through opening

132
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,102
Uncluttered curtain,

133
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,069
Uncluttered curtain.

134
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:25,786
- Maria Dmitrievna... "Hush!

135
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:27,943
Happy New Year.

136
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,463
Why are you shouting

137
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:30,897
And what?

138
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:35,659
"Mother! Who's there? "A neighbor came to get some onions.

139
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:39,696
"What happened - Pavlik, come back tomorrow.

140
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:42,384
I'm leaving for Leningrad today.

141
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,621
Have a nice trip!

142
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:00,860
Why are you being a bully

143
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:06,501
"Mom, who's there again "A telegram from Aunt Vera .

144
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:09,900
Do you remember when you were a child they taught us to speak

145
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:11,216
just the truth?

146
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:14,903
There are such cases, when it's a good idea to lie

147
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:18,025
And the fact that they are waiting for us in the bathhouse Mishka and Sasha?

148
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,256
It's nothing.

149
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:21,577
And from the bathhouse I fly to Leningrad.

150
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:25,297
Why are you flying to Leningrad?

151
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,186
Irka lingered there on a business trip,

152
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:31,464
And I'm flying to meet her new year. What happened

153
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:36,343
"It's still a mystery. "What secret?"

154
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:41,502
"You'll find out in time "Zhenya has no secrets from me.

155
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,544
Go to the bathhouse.

156
00:16:55,666 --> 00:17:00,740
Eugene, I have to go. I still have so much to do!

157
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,065
- Galya!.. - what?

158
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:14,574
Galya...

159
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:19,223
The thing is...

160
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:24,416
Well, as they say?..

161
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:28,505
I love you.

162
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:33,141
I want you to be my wife.

163
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:39,578
But I'm always going to flash around right in front of your eyes.

164
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,104
Flash it.

165
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,736
I really want to do this.

166
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:56,815
Here's the key. Come back at 11 celebrate the New Year.

167
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:07,223
Can I get you a salad?"

168
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:09,459
Salad?

169
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:13,656
I didn't understand the main thing: do you agree?"

170
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:16,895
But I took the keys.

171
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:20,615
What does this mean?

172
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:25,175
And it doesn't mean anything.

173
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:33,337
See you tonight." Hi to Mom Pass on.

174
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:41,380
- Katanyans are not very good... "They'll be fine.

175
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:12,291
Mother!

176
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:18,336
Amid a noisy ball,

177
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:21,814
Accidentally...

178
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,499
In the anxiety of worldly vanity ...

179
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:34,254
"I think I'm getting married "I think so, too.

180
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:37,011
Well, how do you like Galya?

181
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:39,492
You're going to marry her, not me."

182
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:42,893
But you're my mother!

183
00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:48,896
The main thing is that you remember it after getting married .

184
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:54,573
I understand that Galya is for you I don't like it.

185
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:57,814
I can't say I'm from her I'm thrilled,

186
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:02,661
but, in general, it is not stupid, well-mannered.

187
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:03,891
I see.

188
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:08,055
If you don't get married now, you'll never get married!

189
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,293
I'm 36 years old, by the way...

190
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:14,779
That's tactless of you remind me of my age.

191
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:18,052
I'm not offended, though.

192
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:20,090
Let go!

193
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:24,416
Come on, I'm not offended. I'm a global mom!

194
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:27,812
I'll get everything ready and go to a friend's house.

195
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:33,174
"Where did the glasses go ?" "We'll find it now." Glasses !

196
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:35,094
They're here

197
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,809
You won't find anything with this move.

198
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:39,619
They're not here.

199
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:42,740
Here they are!

200
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:48,053
And yet, what did she see in me?

201
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,812
She's a lot younger than me.

202
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:54,131
Besides, she's such a beauty!

203
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,052
I'm also surprised that she chose such a blockhead.

204
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,329
A blockhead?

205
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,892
Why did you tell her about Leningrad?

206
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,812
When you make an offer to one woman,

207
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,255
then they don't remember the other one.

208
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,852
"Ah, that's what they do! - Yes, it is.

209
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,091
Now I understand everything!

210
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,170
How to make an offer, I understand now.

211
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,648
Good-bye!

212
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,774
"Who's been calling all this time?" - Pavel.

213
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,808
He's leaving for Leningrad. I put him out so he wouldn't get in the way.

214
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,854
Maybe I should go after all to the bathhouse?

215
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:37,170
Nothing will be wrong,

216
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:40,172
if you celebrate the New Year clean.

217
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:41,932
It's decided, I'm going to wash up.

218
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:47,857
Bathroom in each apartment - That's correct.

219
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:50,650
This is a civilization.

220
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,174
"You're telling me "You."

221
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,411
But the washing process itself ,

222
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:59,618
which in the bathhouse looks like, as a solemn ceremony,

223
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:04,331
in the bathroom, just washing off the dirt.

224
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,207
And then, a wish "with light steam" in the bathroom!

225
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:14,613
In the fresh air.

226
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,849
But is there steam in the bathroom?

227
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,729
Misha is right, the bath cleanses.

228
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:23,657
Oh, guys!

229
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:29,008
No matter how beautiful it is here, But I have to go.

230
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:32,091
You're not a good person after all.

231
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:33,976
We're all waiting...

232
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:36,217
What are you waiting for?

233
00:22:36,978 --> 00:22:41,051
Do you want to get away with it? Not celebrating your marriage ?

234
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:43,932
In the bathhouse?

235
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:47,887
Actually, Zhenya is right, they don't let you go to the bathhouse.

236
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:53,175
If it wasn't for me, you'd all be they disappeared here.

237
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:56,645
Here!

238
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:00,048
No, I won't, I can't.

239
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:05,295
One at a time, because personally I'm going to the airfield.

240
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,808
People, don't worry

241
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:11,776
Everyone needs to be in shape.

242
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:16,331
Guys, let's do it tomorrow. Come and see me.

243
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:19,728
I'll introduce you to my wife.

244
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:22,286
Tomorrow I will be in Leningrad.

245
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:23,970
Well, drink up.

246
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:28,337
I wonder what you chose?

247
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:31,569
Not "what", but "who"!

248
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:35,969
It's terrible: vodka after beer.

249
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:38,292
I had a night vision on duty...

250
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:42,887
Here's a chocolate bar, at least some of it a snack.

251
00:23:43,136 --> 00:23:45,650
All right, let's have a sip.

252
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,246
Pavel, make a toast.

253
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:51,851
You're the best of us all eloquent.

254
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:56,171
"And you're the least intelligent of us all." "Thank you."

255
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,690
I say...

256
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,611
Here's to Zhenechka Lukashin.

257
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,175
Come on, no fooling around.

258
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,407
The shyest of us all,

259
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:09,854
which finally overcame this is the quality and married.

260
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:12,724
The last of us.

261
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:16,930
Zhen, it's serious now. Be happy!

262
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:21,167
"Be happy, Zhenya. "You should drink to that

263
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:23,167
This is really serious.

264
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:33,570
Hey, what's her name?"

265
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,126
She has a beautiful name.

266
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:46,643
Galya.

267
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:49,773
And, remarkably, rare.

268
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:54,008
Guys, the situation is hopeless.

269
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:56,769
For Galya!

270
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:00,132
For Galya to the bottom!

271
00:25:01,174 --> 00:25:03,893
Well, Jackdaw, be happy!

272
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:06,694
What scoundrels you are !

273
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:11,007
I was on night duty...

274
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:13,644
Oh, it's warm!

275
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,165
Tell us how you met

276
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:19,845
That's the whole story.

277
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:23,165
She came to me to the clinic.

278
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,325
Is she sick?"

279
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:26,802
No.

280
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,452
She was dislocated.

281
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:34,209
Everything is clear. That's exactly why she she's marrying you.

282
00:25:35,054 --> 00:25:38,045
Here's to both of them they were healthy .

283
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:41,808
Are you giving birth to them Put it away now!

284
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:44,044
My wife told me to take it for the guests.

285
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,763
If we continue at this rate, get promoted,

286
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,004
I won't get to the airfield.

287
00:25:50,253 --> 00:25:54,883
Pasha, rely on me, I never get drunk.

288
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:56,612
Give me your ticket.

289
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:59,686
This is categorically me not for your health!

290
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:03,645
She'll think I'm an alcoholic!

291
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:10,084
Unheard of! Doctor refuses to drink to health .

292
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:15,485
The devil made me go with you in the bath.

293
00:26:19,772 --> 00:26:23,048
Tell me how you are with her did you meet someone?

294
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:27,367
Will you tell me? With whom?

295
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:30,767
With Galya. Or do you have anyone else

296
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:33,606
No, I don't have anyone, I'm single.

297
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:38,320
"For what?" "Here's to the bachelor."

298
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:40,563
For a single life hooray!

299
00:26:41,172 --> 00:26:43,163
You should drink to that

300
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:44,891
It's good for you!

301
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:49,482
But how can I imagine, what a scandal it will be,

302
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:52,883
If I maybe come home to celebrate the New Year!

303
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:58,680
People, I was born very an important toast.

304
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,765
You can't do this anymore, you're getting married today.

305
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:03,970
I haven't forgotten that.

306
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:06,884
If you forget, I'll remind you.

307
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:11,120
Guys, let's have a drink for our friendship!

308
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:13,163
Good girl!

309
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:17,086
You speak beautifully You're a natural speaker!

310
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:18,810
Move over a little.

311
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:23,244
Let's weigh in to bruderschaft.

312
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:31,403
How much are you and I in total can we pull it?

313
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:36,525
Guys, a lyric was born tender toast.

314
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:40,924
Everything! We need to go to the airfield.

315
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,765
"Why?" -Someone is flying to Leningrad.

316
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:50,801
"Let's go quickly. "We didn't go, we flew.

317
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,679
They strapped themselves in with sheets. From the screw!

318
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:01,326
Under the wing of an airplane Singing about something

319
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,442
Green sea of taiga.

320
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,723
Under the wing of an airplane Singing about something

321
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,082
Green sea of taiga.

322
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:27,280
Attention! Being announced boarding the TU-134 aircraft,

323

next flight 392 on the route Moscow-Leningrad.

324
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,366
Пассажиров просят пройти на посадку.

325
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:43,839
-По-моему, это наш самолет. -Я с тобой согласен.

326
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:48,002
А ты не помнишь, кто из нас летит?

327
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:49,238
Нет.

328
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,967
Подожди, положись на меня.

329
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:59,641
-Пойдем логическим путем. -Пойдем вместе.

330
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,639
-Ты летишь в Ленинград? -Нет.

331
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:06,526
И я нет.

332
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:12,126
Продолжается посадка в самолет ТУ-134.

333
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:16,082
Павел может лететь в Ленинград?

334
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:19,157
Может.

335
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,719
А Женя?

336
00:29:25,168 --> 00:29:26,601
Тоже может.

337
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:29,681
Они оба могут.

338
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,842
Будем тянуть жребий?

339
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:42,526
Мы не будем полагаться на случай.

340
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:47,604
Мы в бане пили за что?

341
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,803
По Лукашину.

342
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,000
Потому что он женится.

343
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:59,080
-У тебя поразительная память. -Сейчас не об этом.

344
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:04,720
Значит, Женя летит в Ленинград

345
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,283
на собственную свадьбу.

346
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:14,004
И он бы об этом сказал, если бы его не развезло от усталости.

347
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,646
Подожди!

348
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:20,797
He met his the bride in the clinic,

349
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:23,276
When did she come to him for an appointment.

350
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:25,005
I'll give you an answer.

351
00:30:26,486 --> 00:30:27,965
What does it mean?

352
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:33,365
That she came to Moscow on a business trip.

353
00:30:35,886 --> 00:30:37,877
Iron logic.

354
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:41,478
Boarding ends to the TU-134 plane,

355
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:45,719

"Where are you taking me?" - Towards your happiness .

358
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:58,002
Wait a minute! It's good that we have it washed it.

It's cold!

364
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:17,032
Heck!

365
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:22,635
You should drink less!

366
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:26,191
Pavlik!

367
00:32:26,723 --> 00:32:31,399
Attention of flying passengers flight 361 to Krasnoyarsk.

And in the best case?

378

No. I don't want.

Has everyone gone mad?

I'm not a flower bed.

434
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:48,259
Who are you, eh?

435
00:42:49,308 --> 00:42:50,946

"What are you doing here?" "I'm sleeping here."

439
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:04,301

440
00:43:04,588 --> 00:43:06,977
Come on, stop fooling around

441
00:43:07,388 --> 00:43:09,583

Come on, get out of here!"

443
00:43:12,427 --> 00:43:13,655
Alive!

444

00:43:19,107 --> 00:43:22,099
you're acting like a bandit!

446

00:43:31,547 --> 00:43:34,664
I'm not interested at all. It's an outrage!

450
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:38,866
By the way, now here my fiancee Galechka is coming.

451
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:40,096
I don't want,

452
00:43:40,347 --> 00:43:42,702
so that we can be caught together.

453
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:47,299
Explain to me why your will the bride come to me?

00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,299
What time is it?

456
00:44:00,946 --> 00:44:03,176
Oh my God, it's almost 11. They must come to me.

457
00:44:03,426 --> 00:44:07,783
And your presence here not necessarily.

458
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:12,344
Why your friends will come on New Year's Eve to my place?

459
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:14,304
I'm thirsty!

460
00:44:15,626 --> 00:44:20,620

Bryce

469
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:40,858
What are you hooligans about?!

470
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:45,064
My mother and I live here. The usable area is 32 meters.

471
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:49,503
No, it's my mom and me the apartment is 32 square meters.

472
00:44:49,745 --> 00:44:53,454
Congratulations! We don't have much large apartments .

473
00:44:53,705 --> 00:44:55,696
A very valuable observation.

474
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:57,344
Who rolled me up?

475
00:44:57,585 --> 00:45:00,304
I would be extremely grateful to you I appreciate it,

476
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:03,457
if you would, as soon as possible, they disappeared

477
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:08,574
Don't beat me up! I demand respect for myself!

478
00:45:09,145 --> 00:45:10,180
Mother!

479
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:11,654
My mother was gone.

480
00:45:12,105 --> 00:45:13,094
I'll kill you !

481
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:19,138
"Whose mom left?" "Fortunately, we have different mothers .

482
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,453
Yes?

483
00:45:30,304 --> 00:45:34,217
Sorry about that... And both moms left?

484
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:38,741
One of us, I think crazy.

485
00:45:40,464 --> 00:45:42,534
I can guess who.

486
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:44,456
I know who, too.

487
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:47,214
Are you referring to me?

488
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:53,298
Caution!

489
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:59,056
Why did you rearrange my closet?

490
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:02,532
As it was introduced, so it stands.

491
00:46:03,383 --> 00:46:09,015
This is my headset, Polish.

492
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:13,492
-830 rubles. - And 20 on top.

493
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:17,581
No, I gave 25.

494
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:20,056
That's your business.

495
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:24,013
What a nightmare! An obsession!

496
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:33,136
And our family screen snatched away!

497
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:43,775
Why did my mother put it on other people's plates?

498
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:47,615
Finally, you're getting started to see clearly

499
00:46:47,862 --> 00:46:50,012
And what is there to see through?

500
00:46:50,622 --> 00:46:53,420
So you entered, rearranged furniture. ..

501
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:56,498
We changed the plates.

502
00:46:56,782 --> 00:46:58,977
Where did you put my chandelier?

503
00:46:59,222 --> 00:47:01,213
I took it to a thrift store.

504
00:47:02,142 --> 00:47:03,336
What for?

505
00:47:08,222 --> 00:47:09,940
Where am I?

506
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:14,732
25 3rd Stroiteley Street, apartment 12.

00:47:19,221 --> 00:47:24,215
But I have a feeling, That I'm not home.

509
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:25,894
That's fine!

510
00:47:26,141 --> 00:47:27,938
You can leave safely.

511
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:30,615
Where will I go in this form?

512
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:33,455

00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:52,297
A hooligan! Where's my jacket?

518
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:56,010
"How do I know?" "Who knows?"

519
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,296
Grey herringbone pattern...

Why are you going there?

537
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:56,691
Why are you always poking around in my furniture?

538
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,857
"Please." "What have you got here?"

539
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:02,607
Well, what is it?

540
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:10,135
Leningrad, 3rd Stroiteley Street, 25, apartment 12.

541
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:14,778
Uh-huh what ?

542
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:22,850
Are you implying that I'm in Leningrad?

543
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:25,846
"Here! "Here's what?"

544
00:49:26,378 --> 00:49:27,367
In Leningrad.

545
00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:29,651
How did I get here?

546
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,686
Poor.

547
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:36,173
"We went to the bathhouse. - With light steam!

548
00:49:37,138 --> 00:49:41,097
"Now go away!" "Where will I go?"

549
00:49:43,058 --> 00:49:45,208
No need to wave your hands

550
00:49:45,498 --> 00:49:50,856
Can you explain to me that I'm in Leningrad now?

551
00:49:52,138 --> 00:49:53,651
This is now...

552
00:49:53,898 --> 00:49:55,729
Is this a city on the Neva River?

553
00:49:58,297 --> 00:50:01,687
Wait... I remember everything perfectly.

554
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:08,374
We went to the airfield to see Pavlik off.

555
00:50:09,537 --> 00:50:11,607
Before that, we washed

556
00:50:14,857 --> 00:50:20,409
Did I just fly away? Pavlik?

557
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:24,015
- Don't drink it "I don't drink at all .

558
00:50:24,257 --> 00:50:27,647
It was an accident.

559
00:50:30,617 --> 00:50:34,496
So I'm in Leningrad now?

560
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:44,494
What a nightmare!

561
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:49,405
So, the Pebble is now in Moscow,

562
00:50:49,656 --> 00:50:53,410
And I'm on the floor in Leningrad.

563
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:06,374
Oh, God, I wish I could fly away to some other city.

564
00:52:14,454 --> 00:52:17,924
Not necessary... What's going on there?

565
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:20,251
Don't open it, please!

566
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:24,885
- If you don't open it right away, it's worse. "Don't open it at all!

567
00:52:26,134 --> 00:52:28,523
FYI, this is: him!

568
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:33,290
Who is "he"? I'll get dressed. Don't open it! I'm not wearing any pants.

569
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:37,568
"Hello," I said. "Hello," I said.

570
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:42,650
Happy New Year, Nadenka.

571
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:57,007
Well, come on.

572
00:52:58,613 --> 00:53:01,081
"How did you get there?" "Don't ask me!

573
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:04,052
It's slippery and icy right now.

574
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:07,171
Be careful, I've got you such a reckless driver.

575
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:11,771
Thank you, Nadyusha.

576
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:17,641
If you only knew, honey, I've missed you so much.

577
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:20,565
I've been waiting for you, too.

578
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:22,770
Thank you, my love.

579
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:28,207
I've made you mine New Year's gift.

580
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:31,922
Thanks. I made it too a present for you.

581
00:53:35,452 --> 00:53:37,363
But he's in the room.

582
00:53:40,612 --> 00:53:43,604
Ippolit, I owe you something to report.

583
00:53:44,852 --> 00:53:47,650
It's impossible to believe

584
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:50,683
You'll die laughing!

585
00:53:51,452 --> 00:53:55,684
I come home, and on my the ottoman

586
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:58,725
a strange man is sleeping.

587
00:53:59,212 --> 00:54:01,930
You know, I couldn't do it wake me up.

588
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:06,042
I watered it from the kettle.

589
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:16,203
- So... "I'm begging you!

590
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:19,329
Happy New Year! Behave yourself!

591
00:54:19,571 --> 00:54:20,970
I'm begging you!

592
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:23,679
Great gift. Thanks.

593
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:27,480
I'll explain everything to you. It's not her fault.

594
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:29,124
It's my fault.

595
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:32,966
I'd like to know one small detail

596
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:34,246
Find out.

597
00:54:34,491 --> 00:54:36,402
"Who's that?" "I don't know him.

598
00:54:36,851 --> 00:54:38,603
This is a strange man.

599
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:39,920
Man...

600
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:41,808
How did it get here?

601
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,120
This is an incredible coincidence.

602
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,122
He lives there too

603
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:51,728
on the 3rd Stroiteley Street, 25, apartment 12, only in Moscow.

604
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:52,999
In Moscow!

605
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:56,765
"What's this?" "And these are my pants ."

606
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,126
Be careful, remember!

607
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:04,008
He and his friends went to the bathhouse. There they drank.

608
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:06,726
"Look at him. "I'll make it."

609
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,404
And it was stuffed in by mistake get on the plane.

610
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,288
Where, in the bathhouse?

611
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,562
No, there are no planes in the bathhouse.

612
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:17,884
And they don't ask you!

613
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:21,246
Tell him we bathed there with Pavlik.

614
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:23,445
Oh, shut up !

615
00:55:24,169 --> 00:55:26,808
They drove from the bathhouse to the airport.

616
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:28,164
Pavlik is seen off.

617
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:31,879
- To see Pavlik off. - Pavlik is also here!

618
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:36,202
Pavlik isn't here. I'll take his place.

619
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:37,848
Instead of Pavlik

620
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:39,920
did this guy come in?

621
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:44,128
No one was supposed to come.

622
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:49,406
No one was supposed to come.

623
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:54,200
"He got on the plane by mistake. "Was it checked in?"

624
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:58,442
What kind of luggage? Although maybe, I don't remember.

625
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:03,204
I'll explain everything in a moment, but I need to get dressed.

626
00:56:03,448 --> 00:56:04,847
Hold this, my friends .

627
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:08,876
I'll get dressed and explain everything to you.

628
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:12,916
"How unsympathetic he is! "Just disgusting!"

629
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:18,322
No, this is a moot point. I didn't do anything wrong to you.

630
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:22,123
"How did he end up in your bed?" "By accident.

631
00:56:22,368 --> 00:56:24,199
Sorry, girl.

632
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:26,086
What is your name?

633
00:56:28,128 --> 00:56:31,803
He's in your bed, but he doesn't even know your name.

634
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:34,167
No need to push!

635
00:56:34,408 --> 00:56:35,887
Ippolit, wait!

636
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:37,720
Something fell on me!

637
00:56:37,968 --> 00:56:41,199
If he knew my name, would you have stayed?

638
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:43,438
"Stop it!" "Oh, come on !

639
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:47,885
I don't know his name either. This is the first time I've seen him!

640
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,437
Now I believe you. Modern mores !

641
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:55,441
Why do you keep dropping me?

642
00:56:55,687 --> 00:56:58,679
I hit my shoulder right here.

643
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:00,838
I'm leaving now for good.

644
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:04,119
Let's not spoil New Year's Eve.

645
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:06,562
Don't make me make excuses.

646
00:57:06,807 --> 00:57:10,277
I didn't do anything wrong to you.

647
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:14,324
Some drunkard got into my apartment!

648
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:16,285
I'm not a drunk, I'm a doctor.

649
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:20,037
Suppose he happened to be in Leningrad,

650
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:21,686
and it has the same address.

651
00:57:21,927 --> 00:57:25,077
"But why did you let him in?" "I didn't let him in!"

652
00:57:25,326 --> 00:57:29,285
You will finally understand I entered by myself!

653
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:34,361
"I have a key that fits." "You gave him the key?"

654
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:37,325
I didn't give it to you! Well, how stupid you are!

655
00:57:37,926 --> 00:57:41,362
Don't push me Some pushers.

656
00:57:41,606 --> 00:57:43,403
Why don't you believe me

657
00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:45,637
Why don't you believe us?

658
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:49,003
I hate this guy as much as you do.

659
00:57:49,246 --> 00:57:51,362
Of course, I'm disgusted with myself.

660
00:57:52,526 --> 00:57:53,845
Sorry.

661
00:57:56,846 --> 00:57:58,074
Goodbye.

662
00:58:29,445 --> 00:58:31,834
The house is exactly the same.

663
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:38,199
A young man like me get to the airport.

664
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,882
There's a 30 bus around the corner it stops.

665
00:58:43,445 --> 00:58:47,483
-Is this really Leningrad? - You should drink less.

666
00:59:56,443 --> 00:59:58,161
Well, stop sulking.

667
00:59:59,523 --> 01:00:01,241
Don't you dare be jealous of me.

668
01:00:02,443 --> 01:00:06,230
If I fall in love with someone, you'll be the first to know.

669
01:00:07,122 --> 01:00:08,919
"Don't you dare be jealous."

670
01:00:11,082 --> 01:00:16,554
I'm not angry, it's just that you are too You must understand

671
01:00:16,802 --> 01:00:19,714
-I come, and here... "I know what you mean.

I understand very well.

673
01:00:22,442 --> 01:00:26,117
I'd roll my eyes if I were you this!

674
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:30,514
His appearance in your home, fits your character.

675
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:33,595
"Why not?" "You're careless.

676
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,321
Be quiet! You're a bad girl.

677
01:00:35,562 --> 01:00:38,554
I don't think he's in my house it could have appeared.

678
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,362
It's weird that you're even using it found it.

679
01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:43,320
You never know what's lying around there.

680
01:00:43,562 --> 01:00:47,190
You guessed it, I didn't get it right away I noticed it.

Such an expensive gift.

688
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,399
I take an example from you.

689
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:38,230

Flashing a pair of compasses Iron,

716
01:05:20,435 --> 01:05:24,064
How cold it is You're closing the circle,

717

730
01:06:41,353 --> 01:06:47,349
And then Out of tears, out of the dark ,

731
01:06:48,673 --> 01:06:52,301

736
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:29,186
"Whose poems are these?" - Akhmadulina.

737
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,582
What should I put for you

738
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:06,903
"Salad or roast beef?" - Salad... and roast beef.

739
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:12,590
Nadia, listen to me...

740
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:19,940
Tonight is the last night Old year's day I intend to

741
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:24,229
put the question squarely.

742
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,669
It seems to me,

743
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:32,062
that it's time for us to end our idleness.

744
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:35,421
What do you think of that

745
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,229
I look at it with pleasure.

746
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:46,107
But only if you don't get so jealous.

747
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:52,863
You see, I'm not young anymore, but I can feel it...

748
01:08:55,989 --> 01:08:56,978
Who is it?

749
01:08:58,989 --> 01:09:01,139
I have no idea.

750
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,101
No, I'm sorry!

751
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:05,137
I'm sorry.

752
01:09:14,949 --> 01:09:19,227
Sorry, I was too shy to open it with my key.

753
01:09:20,509 --> 01:09:22,739
What do you need again?

754
01:09:22,989 --> 01:09:25,059
You see, here's the thing...

755
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:28,301
I have no one else in this city but you.

756
01:09:28,869 --> 01:09:30,268
And no money, either.

757
01:09:30,509 --> 01:09:33,068
Not a penny, as it turned out.

758
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:36,499
And they won't give you a ticket without money.

759
01:09:40,388 --> 01:09:43,380
Could you borrow 15-16 rubles?

760
01:09:43,628 --> 01:09:45,823
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

761
01:09:46,068 --> 01:09:48,059
I'll send it by wire.

762
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:53,336
You'll have to pay to leave us alone."

763
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:55,579
Please pay me.

764
01:09:55,828 --> 01:09:59,867
Now, man to man: what were you doing here?"

765
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:01,541
"Right here?" "Yes, here.

766
01:10:01,788 --> 01:10:05,622
For God's sake, don't worry, I'll explain everything to you.

767
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:07,899
You see, we have a tradition.

768
01:10:08,148 --> 01:10:12,539
Every year on December 31, my friends and I go to the sauna.

769
01:10:12,787 --> 01:10:16,666
We're washing up. It's been a long time coming

770
01:10:17,107 --> 01:10:21,737
Pavlik was supposed to fly to Leningrad after the bath.

771
01:10:21,987 --> 01:10:24,342
I was supposed to get married today.

772
01:10:25,147 --> 01:10:26,136
On whom?

773
01:10:27,507 --> 01:10:28,826
Get married?

774
01:10:30,787 --> 01:10:33,255
Well, it doesn't matter.

775
01:10:33,507 --> 01:10:35,498
We had a drink in the bathhouse.

776
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:39,342
For my bride, for me.

777
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,301
Are you an alcoholic?

778
01:10:41,587 --> 01:10:43,578
No, I don't drink at all .

779
01:10:44,627 --> 01:10:49,178
I drink tea, coffee, well, kefir,

780
01:10:49,427 --> 01:10:51,895
different drinks, water...

781
01:10:53,027 --> 01:10:56,701
"I'm sorry, Nadenka. "Get a grip on yourself!

782
01:10:56,946 --> 01:10:58,265
I'm calm!

783
01:10:58,506 --> 01:11:03,341
And after the bath we went to the airport.

784
01:11:03,586 --> 01:11:07,545
Well, we had another drink there, but I don't remember that.

785
01:11:08,186 --> 01:11:13,943
I think me instead Pavlik was shoved on the plane.

786
01:11:15,306 --> 01:11:17,024
My word of honor.

787
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:20,497
"It's very simple. -And, most importantly, reliably.

788
01:11:20,826 --> 01:11:24,102
"What were you doing on the plane?" "I was flying.

789
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:26,780
"Fly?  "Sleep."

790
01:11:28,906 --> 01:11:30,498
I was asleep...

791
01:11:30,746 --> 01:11:34,340
Suppose you don't remember, how did you get on the plane,

792
01:11:34,585 --> 01:11:37,622
but, how did you get out of there, you should have remembered

793
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:40,937
Yes! You must remember.

794
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,144
But I don't remember.

795
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,377
Because I remember coming here by taxi.

796
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:53,301
I said my home address the address and I was brought.

797
01:11:54,305 --> 01:11:56,660
Let's assume the key fits.

798
01:11:56,905 --> 01:11:58,099
Nadenka...

799
01:11:58,825 --> 01:12:02,022
Let's assume the key fits, the address matched,

800
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:06,736
but you couldn't help but notice that the apartment furniture is different!

801
01:12:07,025 --> 01:12:08,253
Yes, the same!

802
01:12:08,505 --> 01:12:12,942
But the apartment is a mess, because people have moved!

803
01:12:13,185 --> 01:12:16,813
We just moved in too! With my mother.

804
01:12:17,064 --> 01:12:21,216
That's enough! Here's 15 rubles for you and go away!

805
01:12:21,464 --> 01:12:23,534
Friends, you helped me out so much!

806
01:12:23,784 --> 01:12:26,696
You have to pay for pleasure

807
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:31,223
I just need to give you one last kiss

808
01:12:31,904 --> 01:12:34,418
At least wait until I'm gone.

809
01:12:34,664 --> 01:12:39,533
"Hippolytus, wait! "Don't make an idiot of me!

810
01:12:43,184 --> 01:12:44,173
Ippolit!

811
01:12:55,903 --> 01:12:58,098
"What did you tell him?" "The truth.

812
01:12:58,343 --> 01:12:59,822
What other truth?

813
01:13:00,063 --> 01:13:04,773
Please help me up.

814
01:13:05,503 --> 01:13:08,734
I'm completely exhausted with you today.

815
01:13:09,183 --> 01:13:12,061
I told him we were going to the bathhouse.

816
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:16,933
December, 31st. This is our tradition. We wash . Annually.

817
01:13:17,183 --> 01:13:21,062
I explained this to him in detail.

818
01:13:22,303 --> 01:13:27,536
Don't cry,please I'm asking you very much.

819
01:13:27,943 --> 01:13:31,094
I'll catch up with him now. Ippolit!

01:13:40,102 --> 01:13:42,536
Wait, don't leave!

821
01:13:43,902 --> 01:13:48,180
Ippolit, I'm sorry, I do not know your patronymic!

822
01:13:48,822 --> 01:13:49,937
Wait!

823
01:13:50,182 --> 01:13:53,777
Don't leave ! Wait!

824
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:58,060
Well, don't be a fool!

825
01:13:58,502 --> 01:14:01,892
In fact, be you a man!

826
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:35,420
He's gone.

827
01:14:37,781 --> 01:14:40,249
He drives faster than I do I run.

828
01:14:41,181 --> 01:14:43,172
Take your 15 rubles.

829
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:46,015

He'll be back, I promise, you'll see.

832
01:14:55,341 --> 01:14:58,332
Hot-tempered and jealous they leave quickly.

833
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,330
If only you knew how I understand you.

834
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,571
My situation is even worse.

835
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:08,176

Does she know where you are ?"

840
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,419
No, she's going crazy.

"Call her. "I don't have a ticket."

842

Call on credit, call on the vending machine.

843

01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,046
At seven o'clock in the morning.

893
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:10,199
Nadia, don't worry, I'll talk to Galya and leave.

894
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:14,319
It seems to me that you will never you can't leave here.

895
01:22:23,809 --> 01:22:26,482
Well, please don't worry.

896
01:22:28,249 --> 01:22:30,240
Everything will work out.

897
01:22:30,809 --> 01:22:32,288
Here is Moscow!

898
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:34,247
Moscow?!

899
01:22:41,849 --> 01:22:44,317
I think it was the caller Ippolit.

900
01:22:44,609 --> 01:22:46,281
"Who?" - Ippolit.

901
01:22:48,169 --> 01:22:51,241
Why did you pick up the phone? Who asked you to?

902
01:22:51,489 --> 01:22:54,640
How did I know? I thought it was Moscow.

903
01:22:55,609 --> 01:22:57,600
I'm sorry, for God's sake.

904
01:23:07,888 --> 01:23:09,560
Hello there! Hello there!

905
01:23:11,088 --> 01:23:12,077

906
01:23:12,808 --> 01:23:14,446
Don't touch it, I'll do it myself.

907
01:23:21,088 --> 01:23:23,079
Hello there! Yes, Moscow was booked.

908
01:23:23,968 --> 01:23:25,924

Sorry.

910
01:23:28,408 --> 01:23:30,922
"Galechka, it's me. -Are you in Leningrad?

911
01:23:33,568 --> 01:23:35,240
Thank you for even calling.

912
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:37,877
Galechka, congratulations...

913
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:42,519
Happy New Year to you.

914
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:46,324
You called to congratulate me Happy New Year to me?

915
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:49,401
"Not only that. "I'm touched.

916
01:23:49,647 --> 01:23:51,638
I'll explain everything to you now.

917
01:23:51,887 --> 01:23:54,276
An incredible thing happened history.

918
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:57,439
I just can't believe it

919
01:23:57,687 --> 01:24:01,077
And I'm worried, all the hospitals I called all the morgues.

920
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:03,318
And you just ran away from me.

921
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:05,319
I love you very much.

922
01:24:06,247 --> 01:24:09,205
Now I understand why you he told me about Leningrad.

923
01:24:09,447 --> 01:24:12,439
That's a different story altogether.

924
01:24:12,687 --> 01:24:14,803
This has nothing to do with you.

925
01:24:15,047 --> 01:24:18,039
We are with the guys on December 31 we go to the sauna.

926
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:20,118
We have a tradition.

927
01:24:20,727 --> 01:24:23,718
I have nothing to talk about with you to talk

928
01:24:23,966 --> 01:24:27,515
You can check it out My phone number is 14-50-30.

01:24:27,766 --> 01:24:29,722
I'm taking the first flight.

930
01:24:29,966 --> 01:24:31,957
You can take your time.

931
01:24:33,006 --> 01:24:35,076
I'll leave your key on the table."

932
01:24:35,326 --> 01:24:39,205
No, don't, don't leave it!

933
01:25:23,725 --> 01:25:27,240
It's me! Don't pick up the phone! Hello there! Galya!

934
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:30,761
3 minutes ? Thanks.

935
01:25:38,085 --> 01:25:39,803
Well, that seems to be all.

936
01:25:41,325 --> 01:25:43,281
I don't have a fiancee .

937
01:25:44,325 --> 01:25:47,077
Never mind, you'll find another one.

938
01:25:49,364 --> 01:25:53,323
Another one? What do you know about this?!

939
01:25:54,724 --> 01:25:58,160
I've been searching all my life.

940
01:26:00,244 --> 01:26:02,075
Never married.

941
01:26:04,164 --> 01:26:05,995
And now, I think, I found it...

942
01:26:07,844 --> 01:26:09,835
Why are you yelling at me?

943
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:12,837
That's enough! Don't give stupid advice.

944
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:15,200
Don't forget that you're in my apartment.

945
01:26:16,324 --> 01:26:18,792
Damn your apartment!

946
01:26:19,044 --> 01:26:20,921
Together with you and your Othello.

947
01:26:21,164 --> 01:26:22,483
Ham!

948
01:26:22,724 --> 01:26:23,918
Just a cad.

949
01:26:24,484 --> 01:26:26,075
I'm a cad, and you are ...

950
01:26:26,323 --> 01:26:29,998
Well, what am I?! Get out!"

951
01:26:36,763 --> 01:26:39,914
But I'm not going anywhere! I have nowhere to go.

952
01:26:40,163 --> 01:26:42,631
"My plane leaves at 7 a.m." "Then I'll leave."

953
01:26:42,883 --> 01:26:45,841
Good riddance. And I'm hungry.

954
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:49,632
"This number won't work!" "I'm hungry!"

955
01:26:55,603 --> 01:26:57,514
You're a shrew.

956
01:27:00,323 --> 01:27:04,714
One more word and the next plate will fly to your head.

957
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,680
And your Galya is gone.

958
01:27:19,322 --> 01:27:21,313
And you did the right thing.

959
01:27:24,962 --> 01:27:27,954
Now she will find the real person.

960
01:27:38,482 --> 01:27:40,996
"Well?" "What do you mean?"

961
01:27:41,242 --> 01:27:42,641
Don't mind?

962
01:27:43,562 --> 01:27:45,359
Nothing to cover

963
01:27:46,002 --> 01:27:49,880
No, I'm just afraid of the next plate.

964
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:51,474
It is right.

965
01:27:56,001 --> 01:27:57,912
This is Hippolytus.

966
01:27:58,161 --> 01:27:59,799
Jump from the balcony.

967
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,157
I wanted to break my legs.

968
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:08,839
Nadenka, Happy New Year to you!

969
01:28:09,361 --> 01:28:11,591
We were walking by and decided to take a look at you.

970
01:28:12,561 --> 01:28:15,075
They left my man downstairs.

971
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:18,552
-You can't put him out later-Yes, it's hard to put a man out.

972
01:28:18,801 --> 01:28:20,712
Well, where is he? Show me."

973
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,437
Here it is. In all its glory.

974
01:28:46,1000 --> 01:28:47,989
Valia.

975
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,188
Tanya.

976
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,268
Dear Ippolit Georgievich,

977
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,671
"We're Nadya's friends. "And we work at the same school.

978
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,593
And she's hiding you from us.

979
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,070
We have specially stopped by to congratulate you.

980
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:15,996
You should know which one we have a wonderful Nadia.

981
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:20,270
How teachers love it, parents and even children.

982
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:21,713
She's very responsive.

983
01:29:21,959 --> 01:29:25,668
Conducts community service and it hangs on the honor roll.

984
01:29:25,919 --> 01:29:27,147
I'm not the one...

985
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:33,231
Don't listen to him! Have a seat."

986
01:29:33,479 --> 01:29:36,949
"Call your husband." "What's there to get in the way?"

987
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:40,350
You can't interfere, Nadia and I don't know each other .

988
01:29:40,599 --> 01:29:42,078
What's your middle name?

989
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:43,838
Vassilyevna!

990
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:49,229
With Nadezhda Vasilyevna we've known each other since 11 o'clock.

991
01:29:49,478 --> 01:29:52,231
Hippolytus, don't fool around. All.

992
01:29:52,478 --> 01:29:55,834
Let him fool around, he has it's so nice coming out.

993
01:29:56,078 --> 01:29:57,477
But I'm not Hippolytus.

994
01:29:57,718 --> 01:30:00,471
I love yours so much relationships.

995
01:30:00,718 --> 01:30:03,357
The relationship is quite complex.

996
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:07,386
I need a towel, or it'll shoot."

997
01:30:07,638 --> 01:30:09,117
Don't, I'll be careful.

998
01:30:14,718 --> 01:30:18,393
Well, brothers, for your family health happiness!

999
01:30:18,638 --> 01:30:21,516
Thank you, I won't drink.

1000
01:30:22,278 --> 01:30:25,953
"No, no, I won't. "You will

1001
01:30:26,198 --> 01:30:28,757
"Are you out of your mind?" "Drink up!"

1002
01:30:32,797 --> 01:30:36,472
- Well, guys, it's bitter! "It's bitter!

Nadia, Nadia, come on !

1007
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,832
And even after that, I'm not Hippolytus.

1008
01:31:06,157 --> 01:31:07,431
Ippolit Georgievich,

1009
01:31:08,077 --> 01:31:10,510
do you like the way she sings?

1010
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:12,075
I don't know, I didn't hear it.

1011
01:31:12,316 --> 01:31:16,389
"You never sang to him?" "This is an unforgivable mistake.

1012
01:31:16,636 --> 01:31:20,993
-I don't like amateur performances! -This is not an amateur activity

1013
01:31:21,236 --> 01:31:24,785
Give us our favorite -  "Trailers".

On Tikhoretskaya Street The train will leave,

1015
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:35,825
The trailer will move, The platform will remain,

Brothers, it's a good thing!

1040
01:32:58,594 --> 01:33:01,028
Come on, the guy's cold."

1041
01:33:02,554 --> 01:33:04,943
Nadia and Ippolit, be happy !

1042
01:33:05,194 --> 01:33:07,424
I'm tired of objecting I'm not Hippolytus.

1043
01:33:07,674 --> 01:33:11,951
Good luck to you! Nadechka, let me kiss you!

1044
01:33:12,273 --> 01:33:13,422
Everything!

1045
01:33:16,073 --> 01:33:19,668
A good guy, positive and serious.

1046
01:33:21,713 --> 01:33:24,102
God grant you happiness ! Happy New Year!

1047
01:33:30,913 --> 01:33:33,222
Why did you do this?

1048
01:33:36,753 --> 01:33:40,462
And you also started talking like a parrot!

1049
01:33:40,713 --> 01:33:43,102
"I'm not Hippolytus, I'm not Hippolytus."

1050
01:33:44,473 --> 01:33:48,227
What do you want me to tell them about the bathhouse?"

1051
01:33:50,393 --> 01:33:52,781
So that the whole school can talk the next day,

1052
01:33:53,032 --> 01:33:56,422
That I'm celebrating the New Year with some crook!

1053
01:33:56,672 --> 01:33:57,900
I'm not a crook.

1054
01:33:59,472 --> 01:34:01,463
I'm an unhappy person.

1055
01:34:02,152 --> 01:34:06,145
As if an unhappy person can't be a crook.

1056
01:34:14,472 --> 01:34:18,101
How are you going to show them the real Hippolytus now?"

1057
01:34:23,072 --> 01:34:26,951
And the real one probably won't be there anymore.

1058
01:34:36,711 --> 01:34:39,703
Why do I have to comfort you all the time

1059
01:34:40,631 --> 01:34:43,145
Why is no one comforting me?

1060
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:46,909
It's a thousand times worse for me, even if you're at home.

1061
01:34:47,151 --> 01:34:50,746
"But it's your fault , not mine! "But I didn't mean to.

1062
01:34:50,991 --> 01:34:53,551
I'm also a victim of circumstances.

1063
01:34:58,631 --> 01:34:59,859
Can I eat?"

1064
01:35:00,551 --> 01:35:02,906
Eat as much as you can.

1065
01:35:06,631 --> 01:35:08,701
Don't throw it away.

1066
01:35:08,951 --> 01:35:11,340
I haven't eaten anything since last year.

1067
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:14,709
Delicious!

1068
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:19,986
"Did you cook it yourself?" "Of course, by myself.

1069
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:24,061
I wanted to show off.

1070
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:26,709
And you did it

1071
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:32,107
In the sense that I love to eat delicious food

1072
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:35,105
I hate cooking

1073
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:40,228
True, there is still no time with my loafers.

1074
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,906
"Re-educating them?"- yes.

1075
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:49,026
I am them, and they are me.

1076
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:55,298
I'm trying to teach them to think

1077
01:35:56,269 --> 01:35:58,066
Just a little bit

1078
01:35:59,669 --> 01:36:02,661
And have your own judgment about everything.

1079
01:36:04,069 --> 01:36:06,788
"Can I have some more?" "Please."

1080
01:36:09,069 --> 01:36:13,779
"What do they teach you?" "Probably the same."

1081
01:36:17,549 --> 01:36:21,508
This is not a fish, not a jellied fish.

1082
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:25,948
This... I don't have enough horseradish for it.

1083
01:36:27,669 --> 01:36:32,663
And I am a representative of the most conservative profession.

1084
01:36:38,188 --> 01:36:40,304
We can compete with you.

1085
01:36:40,548 --> 01:36:41,901
No, I'm serious.

1086
01:36:42,548 --> 01:36:46,336
It is especially difficult to have your own opinion here.

1087
01:36:46,588 --> 01:36:48,579
Maybe it's wrong.

1088
01:36:49,868 --> 01:36:52,905
Doctors ' mistakes are costly.

1089
01:36:53,828 --> 01:36:58,106
Teacher mistakes are less noticeable ,

1090
01:36:59,388 --> 01:37:04,303
but, in the end, they are no less expensive.

1091
01:37:05,828 --> 01:37:07,386
Maybe you're right .

1092
01:37:07,628 --> 01:37:10,461
And yet we have with you

1093
01:37:11,228 --> 01:37:14,060
the most wonderful professions, the most necessary ones.

1094
01:37:14,387 --> 01:37:16,059
Judging by the salary, no.

1095
01:37:18,947 --> 01:37:20,665
Yes, probably.

1096
01:37:23,307 --> 01:37:27,459
You know, Nadia, that's when your friends praised you,

1097
01:37:29,067 --> 01:37:32,059
God knows why, I need this it was nice.

1098
01:37:34,907 --> 01:37:36,386
Don't suck up.

1099
01:37:38,347 --> 01:37:41,942
By the way, unlike you, your friend noticed,

1100
01:37:42,187 --> 01:37:44,303
that I'm a positive person.

1101
01:37:44,547 --> 01:37:46,538
You didn't break in to her house.

1102
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:53,179
That's right, I'll go to her again I didn't break in!

1103
01:38:00,466 --> 01:38:04,459
We are with you in a peculiar way Let's celebrate the New Year.

1104
01:38:06,546 --> 01:38:09,538
If we are with you ever Meet me, by chance,

1105
01:38:12,066 --> 01:38:14,785
I think we're going to die laughing.

1106
01:38:16,226 --> 01:38:18,296
Let's just say I wasn't laughing,

1107
01:38:18,546 --> 01:38:21,060
When I saw you here spread out

1108
01:38:21,946 --> 01:38:23,345
What about me?

1109
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:34,938
Imagine me waking up in your apartment,

1110
01:38:35,185 --> 01:38:39,542
and suddenly a woman he pours water on me from the kettle.

1111
01:38:39,785 --> 01:38:42,777
And I say: "Get out of here!"

1112
01:38:43,025 --> 01:38:47,541
And I say: "Roll out yourself from my apartment !"

1113
01:38:49,065 --> 01:38:51,784
I'm just outraged confused

1114
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:54,016
Who are you?

1115
01:38:54,905 --> 01:38:57,578
If the thief, why did you lie down?

1116
01:38:57,825 --> 01:39:03,104
The thief who got tired and went to bed in a robbed apartment.

1117
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:07,934
And you know, at first I thought so didn't like it

1118
01:39:09,545 --> 01:39:14,175
And you were like that to me disgusting !

1119
01:39:19,304 --> 01:39:21,454
I can imagine

1120
01:39:36,544 --> 01:39:37,772
Open
