1
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,810
So, dear fellow radio listeners,

2
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,410
I'm reporting from our seaport!

3
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,233
In a few minutes, this snow-white beauty of a liner

4
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,833
will embark on yet another cruise,

5
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,933
taking away in her comfortable cabins...

6
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:51,033
a large group of Soviet tourists on a fascinating voyage.

7
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,563
Excuse me, please...

8
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:54,063
- Hello ... - Hello.

9
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:57,862
- Э... please tell me your patronymic name... - Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov!

10
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,362
Where do you work?

11
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,162
Senior economist at "Giprorib".

12
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:02,262
Nice to meet you...

13
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,462
Semyon Semyonovich,

14
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:06,642
what would you like to say to our dear fellow radio listeners?

15
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,242
э... before embarking on this fascinating journey.

16
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:12,877
Actually, to tell you the truth,

17
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:14,277
I didn't want to go.

18
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:15,977
I was thinking of buying my wife a fur coat.

19
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:17,878
- Uh-uh-uh-uh... No, the fur coat can wait.

20
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,585
I think the main thing is to see the world!

21
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:22,685
It really works, it really works...

22
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,439
The coat can wait.

23
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,249
Mm-hmm. So you've never been...

24
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,450
Of course I haven't...

25
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,771
We've never been further than Dubrovka. - Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...

26
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:33,071
But you're going abroad for the first time, too?

27
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:34,481
No, I'm not going anywhere.

28
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:36,081
We're seeing Dad off!

29
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,691
- Oh! Well, what is it... - I can't believe it.

30
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:40,323
Fries Street, Fish Street,

31
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:43,420
- Chikanuk Pharmacy... - Lelik, I remember everything perfectly!

32
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,330
Everything must be authentic: I fell down, I swore...

33
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,125
Holy crap! Uh, sorry, "Damn it!"

34
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,125
Look, don't get it wrong!

35
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,962
Trauma, it's realistic.

36
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:58,765
As our dear boss says, it's realism that counts in our business!

37
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,465
Ха-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га!

38
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,115
Well...

39
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,369
It's time, tourist!

40
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Nynado...

41
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:25,999
Go...

42
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,475
Good afternoon!

43
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:31,218
Good afternoon.

44
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,818
Is this cabin sixteen, or, pardon me, am I mistaken?

45
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,628
Sixteenth. Are you going here too?

46
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,728
Yes, let's meet. Gennady Petrovich Kozadoyev...

47
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,628
Pleased to meet you. Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov...

48
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,728
Pleased to meet you...

49
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:43,339
I hope we'll become friends.

50
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:44,557
Of course...

51
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,466
Do you take any souvenirs with you?

52
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:47,853
No, no, no, no, no!

53
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:49,036
I brought...

54
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:50,228
Vodka?

55
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:51,528
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha!

56
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:28,114
I like the song about the bunnies.

57
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:29,392
Who?

58
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,393
The rabbits.

59
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,519
Senya, about the rabbits...

60
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,230
That's not relevant!

61
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:35,940
"Island of Bad Luck"!

62
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,595
All covered with greenery, absolutely all of it,

63
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,595
There's an island of bad luck in the ocean

64
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,650
There's an island of bad luck in the ocean,

65
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:01,778
All covered with green, absolutely all of it!

66
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:04,506
There live the unhappy wild men,

67
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:07,634
♪ Horrible on the face, kind on the inside ♪

68
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:10,662
♪ Horrible on their face, good on the inside ♪

69
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,434
There's a miserable bunch of savages There's a miserable bunch of savages

70
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:16,501
What they do, they can't do, they can't do, they can't do!

71
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:19,503
Their mother must have given birth to them on Monday.

72
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:22,631
They must have been born on a Monday,

73
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:25,718
They can't catch a crocodile, they can't catch a crocodile

74
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:28,679
No crocodile, no coconut to catch, no coconut to grow,

75
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,807
Crying, praying to God, not sparing their tears,

76
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,935
Crying, praying to God, not sparing their tears...

77
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:37,738
No crocodile, no coconut grows...

78
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,558
It's not like they're slackers, and they could live,

79
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:43,485
They should take Mondays and abolish them,

80
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:46,654
They should take Mondays and cancel them,

81
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:49,741
They're not slackers, they could live!

82
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:52,686
The island has no calendar, as luck would have it,

83
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,705
Kids and grown-ups go to waste,

84
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:58,708
♪ Kids and grown-ups go to waste ♪

85
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:01,395
There's no calendar on the damned island!

86
00:10:01,397 --> 00:10:04,397
On such an occasion, from night to dawn

87
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:07,566
The unlucky wild men weep

88
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:10,736
And weep for the poor, and curse their misfortune,

89
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:13,664
On what day - no one knows, no year!...

90
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:15,765
Wa-ba-ba-ba-pfa-ba-ba-ba-badum,

00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:17,566
Sebo-zaba-zaba-zaba-zaba-zabazo.

92
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:20,067
O es, bi man, l'ai... uye...

93
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,576
So, gentlemen, here we are in what is known as the Old City.

94
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:47,384
During the reign of Emperor Shimudshin Shah the Third.

95
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,195
here on these hills was located

96
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,995
the most magnificent ensemble,

97
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,288
including a palace...

98
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,175
...a mosque with two minarets...

99
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,510
a harem...

100
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:10,438
О! Ayb yoh annabaden. Thomas caro romal. Yom rado liko salem jarip pogorello.

101
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:16,438
Lunda hanamarun, zigel, zigel, zigel, ai lulu... Luce paron, ai lulu, ai lulu...

102
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,439
You!

103
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,153
Are you out of your mind?

104
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,653
She wants to tell me something happened...

105
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:25,159
О! Rubiyo-tubiyo, lundo ehsho anabaran. Zigel-zigel, ai lulu!

106
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,360
"Ai-lulu" later. Noo! Niht! No! Absolutely not!

107
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:28,561
Why, does she want something?

108
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:29,812
I'll tell you what she wants later...

109
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:32,612
You know, Signora, Frau, Miss, unfortunately it's not going to work!

110
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,908
Rousseau touristo...

111
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,402
Oblico morale... fair enough?

112
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:38,602
Come on, quick, let's go!

113
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:41,103
A hack! Parteronne!

114
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,029
Ero vas trouhala robusta!

115
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:48,062
Allow me to thank you, Nikolai Ivanovich,

116
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:51,662
for your interesting, very interesting tour, thank you!

117
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:00,959
Comrades, attention!

118
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,269
Now you have free time.

119
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,328
You can walk around the city,

120
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:06,728
but be warned,

121
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,749
at exactly 5:00 p.m.

122
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:11,209
everyone must be on the boat!

123
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:12,309
No tardiness!

124
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:13,409
Do you understand?

125
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:14,409
That's it!

Why did you leave me...?

129
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:22,214
But who left you... Waiting...

130
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:24,966

00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,442
- Zigel! Ziegel... - Damn it!

182
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:34,343
Damn...

183
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,544
Ziegel, ziegel, ziegel!

184
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:36,795
Goddamn it!

185
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:40,934
Up tun!

186
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:42,134
Yippee!

187
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,482
Yee-hae-hae-hae-hae-hae-hae-hae-hae, eee-hae-hae-hae-hae-hae-hae-hae!

188
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:02,622
Goddamn it!

189
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:07,892
Goddamn it!

190
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,163
Goddamn it!

191
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:15,747
Uot kals man?

192
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:17,147
Un blancin gowf...

193
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,698
- Rousseau? - Russo, Russo, Russo!

194
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:25,598
- Mikhail Svetloff? - Mikhail Svetlov! It's me, me, me!

195
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,487
Detsi ein schmatsi? [Where were you looking, you old donkey?]

196
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:30,978
Veserra mod... [But that one also said the password "Damn it!"]

197
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:33,877
Damn it, damn it, damn it! Herrock eskusto ben slag morduk!

198
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:35,678
[Garoque escusse modiuc, ich nach!]

199
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:37,978
[What follows is an untranslatable play on words,

200
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,278
using local idiomatic expressions.]

201
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,579
- ...eledias, eledias... - ...quah tus smaitis supadois, dimkos fear.

202
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,680
- Mak grede manjer... - ...dyinzim sxah, tsigel tsigel, ay-lu-lu

203
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:49,181
Comrade, comrade, comrade, good ay-lu-lu, zigel, zigel - time, comrade!

204
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:13,495
These morons assured me that he was unconscious...

205
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,495
So this sucker doesn't know anything.

206
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:16,693
Well...

207
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,085
Well? What? What is it?

208
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:36,493
It's nothing. It's just smuggling.

209
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,337
- How? - Contra-ban-da!

210
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,438
Aah!

211
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:41,383
Come on, Semyon Semyonovich...

212
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:42,784
Take it easy...

213
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,283
Have a drink!

214
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:45,987
I don't drink...

215
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,305
We read in "The Week", the section for, at home for the family...

216
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:49,905
Doctors recommend it:

217
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,709
It calms the nervous system, dilates blood vessels...

218
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:53,809
Drink it.

219
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:57,441
Drink, drink...

220
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:04,187
- Comrade Captain, - Yes.

221
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:05,787
But what should I do now?

222
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:08,287
Nothing! Rest, dance, have fun...

223
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:11,687
But please, don't say a word about the smuggling to anyone!

224
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,987
I... They'll ask me what happened to my hand.

225
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:15,087
And you say:

226
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,587
I slipped, I fell...

227
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:19,487
closed fracture...

228
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,912
Lost consciousness, woke up.

229
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:23,412
a cast!

230
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:25,382
Slipped...

231
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:26,583
- Fell. Fell.

232
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:27,783
Closed fracture...

233
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:29,683
Passed out, woke up, cast.

234
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:30,804
That's right.

235
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,464
And about that...

236
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:34,514
I'll let you know where to go...

237
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,227
Thank you!

238
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:42,431
Don't you remember anything?

239
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:44,517
- Careful! - Careful...

240
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:46,444
Why, I remember...

241
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,780
Remember what?

242
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:49,305
I slipped...

243
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:50,215
Okay...

244
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:51,224
Fainted...

245
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:52,134
Okay.

246
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,334
Woke up, cast...

247
00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:54,144
That's it?

248
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:55,054
That's it!

249
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,289
I wish I'd fallen instead of you!

250
00:21:58,389 --> 00:21:59,889
What are you, Gesha... Thank you.

251
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,289
Take care of your hand, Senya, take care of it!

252
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:04,902
Nadya will be upset...

253
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:05,812
What to do...

254
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:07,411
That's "c'est la vie", as they say...

255
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:09,300
- Aah! -Aah!

256
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:12,252
Sorry, friend!

257
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,374
Comrade, should I go already?

258
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:55,474
Come in, comrade, don't hold me up.

259
00:22:56,012 --> 00:22:57,712
- At all? - Yes!

260
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:10,081
Didn't the captain warn them?

261
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:11,543
What to do?

262
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:14,161
But! There he is!

263
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:16,154
It's all right, the goods are in the safe!

264
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:17,681
- And the key? - What?

265
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:20,075
As our beloved chief says,

266
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:21,375
if a man is an idiot.

267
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:22,575
then it's for a long time.

268
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:23,776
Lelik, I don't know what you're talking about?

269
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,977
Now you'll understand!

270
00:23:25,077 --> 00:23:26,077
To the chief!

271
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:43,172
No hands!

272
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:06,737
Where are we going?

273
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:09,598
Home.

274
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:15,088
So you've been abroad?

275
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,507
Yes, I have!

276
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,150
What should I do now?

277
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,749
Where should I go, to the police? Or maybe go home?

278
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:23,262
So I'm going home...

279
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:25,556
Ah!

280
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:27,673
I didn't tell him the address,

281
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:29,425
where he's taking me?

282
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:32,185
There's only one way into town!

283
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:34,988
Please, Morskaya 21, apartment 9,

284
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:37,516
Third floor...

285
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:39,618
Third floor...

286
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:42,429
What's wrong with your hand?

287
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,981
Why does he want to know?

288
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:45,580
What is this mere curiosity?

289
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:47,577
Suspicious type...

290
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:50,246
Slipped, fell...

291
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
Closed fracture...

292
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,780
Lost consciousness, woke up with a cast.

293
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,780
Are you an amateur performer?

294
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:56,985
I do.

295
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,595
Why did I lie, I'm not involved?

296
00:24:58,838 --> 00:24:59,938
Why did he ask?

297
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:01,638
He's talking...

298
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:03,925
A very suspicious guy!

299
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:06,569
Why did he swerve?

300
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:07,868
The road is straight!

301
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:09,168
And there's a repair...

302
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:10,806
A detour...

303
00:25:12,184 --> 00:25:13,384
Stop, we'll take it!

304
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:15,684
Not allowed, the instruction!

305
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:18,312
If you don't hitchhike, you're not a cab driver!

306
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:19,648
Bandit!

307
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:24,903
Why didn't you introduce yourself right away?

308
00:25:25,113 --> 00:25:26,413
I wanted to take a closer look first,

309
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:27,989
to see if he'd be a good match for us...

310
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:29,988
Well, did you check?

311
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:31,767
I checked, Comrade Colonel.

312
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,620
he'll fit.

313
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,014
I didn't expect him to...

314
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,824
with a plaster...

315
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,234
That's right, Comrade Colonel.

316
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,860
Perhaps I should...

317
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,870
Don't!

318
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:44,096
- Did he agree? - He agreed!

319
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,321
Now here's a suggestion, what if...

320
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:47,531
- You shouldn't! - I see.

321
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:48,731
Then maybe we should...

322
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:49,941
- Don't! - I see...

323
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,641
- Let me at least... Try this one!

324
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:54,869
You're in charge of this operation, so do it!

325
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:57,369
Report what's next!

326
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:59,213
Yes, Comrade Colonel!

327
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:02,513
When he and I were thus acquainted,

328
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:04,013
I laid out our plan.

329
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:06,119
What should I do now?

330
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,069
Nothing,

331
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:09,369
live your life, they'll take the bait themselves.

332
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,969
They will follow you, and we will follow them.

333
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:13,569
And as soon as they try to take it off.

334
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:14,968
we'll get them!

335
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:16,668
Yeah, like a bait,

336
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:18,468
I understand... a fisherman himself!

337
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:20,486
They'll offer a big ransom, of course,

338
00:26:20,907 --> 00:26:22,007
and I'll haggle some more.

339
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,208
I don't think so,

340
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:24,508
why would they give themselves away?

341
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:26,608
They're sure you don't know anything,

342
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,208
They'll try to get their merchandise for free

343
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:31,544
and without your knowledge...

344
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:33,852
How do you cut off a man's cast

345
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:34,852
without being noticed?

346
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:35,829
You can...

347
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,329
I really don't know how they would do it...

348
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,529
But you can...

349
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:40,629
get them drunk,

350
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:41,729
put him to sleep,

351
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:43,029
stun them,

352
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:44,829
Well, well, from an emotionless body;

353
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:46,531
finally from a corpse...

354
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:47,541
Uh-huh...

355
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:50,202
Whose corpse?

356
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:52,797
Well... I'm sure it won't come to that...

357
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:56,779
Michal Ivanovich,

358
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,382
Couldn't someone else wear this cast instead of me?

359
00:26:58,482 --> 00:26:59,881
to be worn by someone else instead of me?

360
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,383
Ah... Yes.

361
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:04,168
You can refuse, of course,

362
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:05,338
No, I'm not a coward,

363
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:07,783
but I'm afraid...

364
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:10,895
I'm afraid if I can, if I'm capable.

365
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:13,492
I think, Semyon Semyonych,

366
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,892
every man is capable of many things.

367
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:17,366
But, unfortunately,

368
00:27:17,466 --> 00:27:20,266
not everyone knows what they are capable of.

369
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:23,751
Yes, yes, it happens...

370
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,610
Now let's talk about communication...

371
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:34,799
Come on, Semyon Semyonovich...

372
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
Ah... Ah!

373
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:38,875
Just a moment.

374
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,391
We'll keep in touch like this:

375
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:42,401
Uh-huh...

376
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,562
If we need you...

377
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,861
You'll come to me.

378
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:46,261
If you need us...

379
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:47,971
I'm calling a cab in my name.

380
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:50,071
It'll be me or my assistant, okay?

381
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:50,981
Mm-hmm.

382
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:51,991
Here you go!

383
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,637
Uh... Aye...

384
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:56,619
Thank you very much,

385
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:58,779
I'm sorry I...

386
00:27:59,284 --> 00:28:01,284
It's all right, we've had worse...

387
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:03,458
Why don't we come over to our place?

388
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:04,741
I'll introduce you to my wife...

389
00:28:05,194 --> 00:28:06,294
Semyon Semyonovich!

390
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:07,954
We agreed with you:

391
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:10,557
No one must know!

392
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:13,218
And Nadya?

393
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,318
No one!

394
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,418
I see...

395
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,420
Semyon Semyonovich, and the things?

396
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:36,336
Senya, open up!

397
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,341
Welcome, Semyon Semyonovich!

398
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:49,272
Thank you!

399
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:50,582
I'm sorry it's so late...

400
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:51,723
You know yourself...

401
00:28:51,783 --> 00:28:54,082
Public business comes first!

402
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:56,006
What's wrong with your hand?

403
00:28:56,784 --> 00:28:57,584
Yes...

404
00:28:57,585 --> 00:28:58,585
Semyon Semyonovich...

405
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:01,272
We have your lecture in the Red Corner on Wednesday.

406
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,522
It's already advertised.

407
00:29:02,628 --> 00:29:03,728
What lecture?

408
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:04,813
Well, of course,

409
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:05,918
except for you

410
00:29:06,323 --> 00:29:08,523
no one from the housing cooperative has been there.

411
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:11,075
The theme of the lecture: "New York, the City of Contrasts."

412
00:29:11,204 --> 00:29:12,604
I haven't been to New York!

413
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:13,811
Where have you been?

414
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:15,310
I've been to Istanbul, to Marseille...

415
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:17,741
Please, Istanbul is a city of contrasts, what's the difference,

416
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,841
Let's rewrite the ad! What happened to your arm?

417
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,067
Closed fracture,

418
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,367
lost consciousness,

419
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:24,668
woke up with a cast...

420
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:25,845
Great, great,

421
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:27,145
modest, but tasteful...

422
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:28,195
Ahhhh!

423
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,610
That's nice!

424
00:29:31,211 --> 00:29:32,211
Aah!

425
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:32,712
F-f-f-f!

426
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:34,113
Ahhh! Heh-heh...

427
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:35,614
What a beauty!

428
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,300
What happened to your hand, you say, Semyon Semyonovich?

429
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:38,889
This is for you! A souvenir...

430
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:40,389
What are you...

431
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:42,269
Thank you.

432
00:29:42,536 --> 00:29:43,736
Thank you, Semyon Semyonovich...

433
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:45,891
Press the button.

434
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:46,842
Yes?!

435
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:47,992
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

436
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:49,493
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha!

437
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:50,594
Ha-ha-ha...

438
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:51,838
Funny, huh?

439
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:53,148
Very funny.

440
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:56,588
Thank you.

441
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,330
Senya...

442
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:03,189
А...

443
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,890
Have you seen Sophia Loren?

444
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:06,491
No...

445
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:08,585
Have you been drinking Coke?

446
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,320
Uh-huh.

447
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:11,621
How was it?

448
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:12,922
K-k... [bleep]

449
00:30:13,123 --> 00:30:14,023
Uh...

450
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:16,158
Sleep, sleep...

451
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:17,358
Sleep.

452
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:18,429
Doctors recommend...

453
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:19,629
Sleeping pills...

454
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,430
In the week...

455
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,730
for home, for family...

456
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:27,476
Sit down...

457
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,200
Tell me, what happened to your arm?

458
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:35,166
I slipped, fell...

459
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:36,366
Closed fracture...

460
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,066
Lost consciousness, woke up with a cast.

461
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:40,569
I've heard that before. Don't spare me,

462
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:42,594
I don't care if it's the worst, but it's the truth.

463
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,494
Tell me, what happened to your arm?

464
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:45,902
So I say,

465
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,754
I was walking down the street, I slipped, I...

466
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:50,181
um...

467
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:51,381
well, that's...

468
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:56,156
You can't lie, Senya!

469
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:58,762
I know what you have there.

470
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:01,509
Who told you that?

471
00:32:03,764 --> 00:32:05,764
It's not a closed fracture,

472
00:32:08,486 --> 00:32:10,486
but what do you have in there?

473
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:14,886
Gold, diamonds!

474
00:32:16,062 --> 00:32:17,262
Don't make jokes,

475
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:19,808
You don't have a closed fracture in there,

476
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:23,338
It's an open fracture!

477
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:29,798
Let's go to bed.

478
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:05,571
Mea-ow!

479
00:34:25,352 --> 00:34:26,952
You should kill for that!

480
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,607
Lelik only without hands, I'll fix it...

481
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:32,308
I wish you were dead!

482
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,730
I wish I could see you in your coffin,

483
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:36,731
in white slippers!

484
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:40,421
I wish you lived

485
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:42,427
on one

486
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,049
your paycheck!

487
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,121
Victor Nikolayevich,

488
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,179
Can't you read?

489
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,784
А?

490
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:57,296
H-h-h-h...

491
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:59,441
Mama, look how I can... Hee...

492
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:01,272
You can't do that...

493
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:04,002
- You can't. - Wait a minute...

494
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:05,389
There, like that...

495
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:09,032
And I'm telling you, our yards aren't planned for walks.

496
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,167
What are they for?

497
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:11,368
For aesthetics.

498
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,900
And where would he walk?

499
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:15,542
You have a separate apartment.

500
00:35:15,543 --> 00:35:16,642
- Yes. - There and walk!

501
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:17,693
And where would he...?

502
00:35:17,694 --> 00:35:18,894
Well, why so, why...

503
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,912
Good morning!

504
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:20,913
How do you do?

505
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:22,614
I, Varvara Sergeyevna, have been to London,

506
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,744
and there dogs walk everywhere...

507
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:27,602
The dog is man's friend!

508
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:30,747
I don't know what it's like in London...

509
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:31,897
I have not been ...

510
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,736
Maybe there a dog is a friend of man!

511
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:36,483
But here...

512
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:38,460
The supervisor is a friend of man!

513
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,194
Hello!

514
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:12,812
Pops,

515
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,154
do you have a light?

516
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,520
Huh?

517
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:20,901
Ah, ah, ah...

518
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,712
Are you deaf or something?

519
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:24,712
Yes...

520
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:26,627
I see...

521
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
There he is!

522
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:43,644
Lopus...

523
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:46,722
We'll take him without a fuss!

524
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:50,479
Go on, take him fishing,

525
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:53,629
to the black rocks, as agreed.

526
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,730
Invite him overnight...

527
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:57,418
Don't make a fuss:

528
00:36:58,342 --> 00:36:59,742
Ice cream for the kids,

529
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:01,676
and flowers for his woman.

530
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,704
Don't get it wrong.

531
00:37:05,262 --> 00:37:06,262
Kutuzov!

532
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,560
Ah-ha!

533
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:13,931
Gyo-e!

534
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:27,379
Idiot!

535
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,406
Ice cream for the kids!

536
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:38,184
Uh-oh!

537
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,423
The eye is nothing, it'll pass!

538
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:43,973
Senya, how's your arm?

539
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:45,368
It's nothing.

540
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:47,054
- It doesn't hurt? - Nope.

541
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:48,496
Well, wiggle your fingers...

542
00:37:48,806 --> 00:37:49,906
No, not those, those...

543
00:37:49,907 --> 00:37:50,785
Yeah...

544
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:51,786
There, that's all right.

545
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:54,165
It'll do.

546
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:55,344
Gennady Petrovich,

547
00:37:55,354 --> 00:37:57,354
you, as Senin's friend, should influence him.

548
00:37:57,473 --> 00:37:59,673
He's taking it too lightly.

549
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:01,836
You know, he wanted to trick me...

550
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:05,436
That's not at all what Daddy tells everyone, hee-hee...

551
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:08,993
Why?

552
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,573
After all, it's not a closed fracture,

553
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:15,047
It's an open fracture!

554
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,632
Heh-heh-heh-heh...

555
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:18,994
Zing...

556
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:20,145
Come to Mama!

557
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:22,203
Senya, let's go fishing, huh?

558
00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:24,504
Let's go to the Black Rocks,

559
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:26,364
take a boat, sleep overnight,

560
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:27,866
we'll sit out the evening dawn.

561
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:28,867
Sen?

562
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:35,478
- Well? No,

563
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:38,442
I'm not going on an overnight trip,

564
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:39,641
I'm afraid of getting a cold.

565
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:41,144
How about first thing in the morning?

566
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:41,994
That's it!

567
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,421
Let's do it in the morning,

568
00:38:44,172 --> 00:38:45,872
what do you mean in the morning?!

569
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,220
- In the morning! - That's it!

570
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:49,485
Па-ба-ба-ба-ба-ба-ба-ба!

571
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:51,186
Oh, es bi man...

572
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:52,286
Maxim...

573
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,350
What are you doing?

574
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,430
How can you do that?

575
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:58,031
Apologize to your uncle right now!

576
00:38:58,082 --> 00:38:59,382
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

577
00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:00,833
Good boy...

578
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:01,734
Eh...

579
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:08,535
Author's team:

580
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:11,727
artist - Margarita Semyonova,

581
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:15,127
architect - Rogal Levitskaya,

582
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:19,137
chief designer - Albert Mudrik.

583
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,470
Summer Combination Suit

584
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,769
"Universal-69".

585
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,569
Incentive award

586
00:39:26,671 --> 00:39:29,371
at the interregional forum of modern clothes

587
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:30,491
in Zhitomir.

588
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:33,694
Original constructive solution

589
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:36,794
allows you to easily turn a jacket...

590
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
into a jacket!

591
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:44,271
But that's not all!

592
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:47,174
With a slight movement of the hand...

593
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:49,975
the pants turn...

594
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:54,181
The pants turn...

595
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,558
turn your pants...

596
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,865
into elegant shorts!

597
00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:07,213
Sorry, a little technicality...

598
00:40:07,668 --> 00:40:10,667
And last but not least...

599
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:16,411
the Mini Bikini 69 beach ensemble!

600
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:36,591
What happened,

601
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,235
why is the chief here?

602
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,244
Things are changing,

603
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:40,981
We're going to do the operation at White Rock...

604
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:42,442
Why not at the Black Rocks?

605
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:43,848
It's too crowded during the day...

606
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:46,201
But there's no nibble at White Rock...

607
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:47,102
Nibble!

608
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:48,852
There'll be a nibble, I'll take care of that.

609
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:49,899
There'll be so much nibbling..,

610
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900
that the customer will forget all about it!

611
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:53,647
Everything goes according to plan?

612
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:55,096
It's just as we agreed.

613
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:57,027
You stun him a little...

614
00:40:57,029 --> 00:40:57,929
There you go!

615
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:00,286
Lelik,

616
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:02,119
But it's not aesthetically pleasing...

617
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:03,968
But it's cheap, reliable and practical!

618
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,670
Quickly remove the plaster,

619
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:06,947
and wash it off!

620
00:41:06,948 --> 00:41:07,948
And my alibi?

621
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:10,299
Oh yes, you're left with signs of violence on your face...

622
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:13,157
Just like the victim of an attack by unknown assailants...

623
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,221
Lolek! Only I ask you to...

624
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,171
Don't worry, Kozodoev...

625
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:18,926
Kozadoyev!

626
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,777
Kozlodoyev!

627
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,412
I'll hit it gently,

628
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:24,882
but hard!

629
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,283
Ха-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га!

630
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,311
Good evening, Marya Nikolayevna.

631
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:29,711
Good evening, Semyon Semyonovich.

632
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:31,011
Where are you off to in the middle of the night?

633
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:32,611
Early in the morning we went fishing,

634
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,240
and we missed it, and there was no bread...

635
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,250
Now we're going to the avenue to the duty lady,

636
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:38,714
It's a long way, but I have to...

637
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:39,514
Yes, yes, yes...

638
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,975
Ahhhh!

639
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:08,776
Yes...

640
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:12,101
Poor guy...

641
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:14,271
Guys,

642
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,574
it should be me.

643
00:42:16,876 --> 00:42:18,076
If you're drunk, you will be!

644
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:21,108
- Let's load it up! - Come on, pick it up!

645
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:24,908
Waaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!

646
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,550
Heavy... Oops! Into the baby carriage... That's it...

647
00:42:26,551 --> 00:42:28,905
Shit! Come on... let's go.

648
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,244
Good evening, Semyon Semyonovich!

649
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:38,484
Good evening.

650
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:40,152
But I don't know you...

651
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:41,055
Volodya.

652
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:42,199
Senya.

653
00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:46,126
My regards to you from Michal Ivanovich!

654
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:47,558
Ah...

655
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:48,674
Thank you!

656
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:50,174
He wanted to see you very much.

657
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:51,624
When?

658
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:52,856
Any time now!

659
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:54,955
А... I'll be late for the bread...

660
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,655
Don't worry, I have my car,

661
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,244
Let's go...

662
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:03,419
Well, Volodya,

663
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:04,439
thank you very much!

664
00:43:04,444 --> 00:43:05,744
- You shouldn't. - Have a good time.

665
00:43:05,862 --> 00:43:06,862
Have a good time,

666
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:08,256
and have a great time!

667
00:43:08,262 --> 00:43:10,561
So you'll definitely be at the Black Rocks?

668
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:11,825
Yes, yes, the Black Rocks.

669
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:13,026
Well, break a leg!

670
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:14,227
To hell, to hell!

671
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:17,041
Good night, Semyon.

672
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,290
Good night, Semyon Semyonovich!

673
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,258
Yes...

674
00:43:21,748 --> 00:43:22,848
Our people

675
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,424
don't take cabs to the bakery!

676
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:26,625
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

677
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,836
It seems to be here...

678
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:02,251
Or maybe...

679
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:03,587
We shouldn't have come here,

680
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:06,038
The Black Rocks are closer and the bite is better there.

681
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,141
If I'm not mistaken,

682
00:44:07,142 --> 00:44:08,942
there'll be so much nibbling, you'll forget all about it.

683
00:44:09,784 --> 00:44:10,784
Get out of here!

684
00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:34,502
Help!!!

685
00:47:38,386 --> 00:47:40,485
Help!!!

686
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:44,739
SOS...

687
00:47:56,855 --> 00:47:58,855
Help!

688
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:01,083
Lyolik!

689
00:48:01,576 --> 00:48:02,675
Idiot!

690
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:04,189
Ugh!

691
00:48:04,669 --> 00:48:07,169
Mommy!

692
00:48:07,502 --> 00:48:09,552
Lelik!!!

693
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:12,703
Help!!!

694
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:15,401
Mommy!!!

695
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,620
Why are you shouting?

696
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:19,021
Go away boy, don't interfere...

697
00:48:19,122 --> 00:48:20,322
Mom...

698
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:23,486
Mm...

699
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:30,112
Ahh... ah... ah... ah...

700
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:37,030
Let us pray to God...

701
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:43,031
Lord have mercy...

702
00:48:43,032 --> 00:48:47,476
Holy God, we give glory to you,

703
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:53,550
Father and son and holy spirit, now and ever, and forever and ever...

704
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:57,551
Have mercy...

705
00:49:39,407 --> 00:49:41,107
Get out of the way, you little puppy!

706
00:49:41,308 --> 00:49:42,408
Get out of here!

707
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:51,925
Flying ducks...

708
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:56,925
Flying ducks... ducks...

709
00:49:56,926 --> 00:50:03,388
and-and two geese...

710
00:50:04,687 --> 00:50:05,787
Yes... м...

711
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:08,087
The chief is giving us an opportunity to rehabilitate...

712
00:50:08,957 --> 00:50:12,057
The location of the operation, code-named "The Game."

713
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,020
What?

714
00:50:14,006 --> 00:50:15,006
A game!

715
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,159
He's designated the Weeping Willow summer restaurant

716
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:20,914
Strictly north,

717
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:22,074
about...

718
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:24,983
50 meters,

719
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,000
there's a restroom,

720
00:50:28,497 --> 00:50:29,747
like a latrine,

721
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:38,558
indicated in the diagram by the letters "Mae" and "Jo.

722
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:43,667
The asphalt path leading to the toilet goes past the puff,

723
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:46,117
where I will be located.

724
00:50:47,038 --> 00:50:49,038
This is our disposition...

725
00:50:49,624 --> 00:50:50,824
Now your task...

726
00:50:51,685 --> 00:50:53,585
You bring the customer into the restaurant,

727
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:56,367
you get him to the right state of mind,

728
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:58,467
and take them out quickly to freshen up...

729
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:02,024
After making sure the customer is following the direction you want him to go..,

730
00:51:02,124 --> 00:51:04,923
with the words "Senya, I'm waiting for you at the table"

731
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:07,723
you quickly return to your original position...

732
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:09,424
Your alibi is secured.

733
00:51:10,138 --> 00:51:13,638
The client, passing by the fir tree, falls into my hands...

734
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,038
And the rest is a matter of technique.

735
00:51:16,138 --> 00:51:17,138
- You got it?! - Yum, yum...

736
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:19,088
Ah, Lyolik, I'm just afraid, how to bring him to the point?

737
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:20,288
He's a low drinker.

738
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:21,889
As our dear boss says,

739
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:24,989
even teetotalers drink at other people's expense

740
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:26,955
and sober men.

741
00:51:27,562 --> 00:51:29,512
Ха-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га!

742
00:51:41,372 --> 00:51:44,164
Hmm, you can't get a cab on one paycheck...

743
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:47,273
A hundred grand in a row, please.

744
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:48,073
О!

745
00:51:48,545 --> 00:51:51,888
Whoever gets a stack of tickets gets...

746
00:51:51,923 --> 00:51:52,923
Water bottle!

747
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:54,323
Drop your stupid campaigning,

748
00:51:54,423 --> 00:51:56,023
I'm not buying tickets to win!

749
00:51:56,024 --> 00:51:57,324
What are you buying tickets for?

750
00:51:57,343 --> 00:51:58,743
You should read the papers!

751
00:51:58,744 --> 00:51:59,644
Why?

752
00:51:59,645 --> 00:52:00,445
Hmm...

753
00:52:01,476 --> 00:52:03,376
Distribute it among the tenants of our building!

754
00:52:03,377 --> 00:52:06,877
- And if...? А... - And if they don't take it, we'll cut off the gas!

755
00:52:09,658 --> 00:52:11,057
Well, everything is clear...

756
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:14,143
Go to the thrift shops,

757
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:16,088
and look at the market,

758
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:17,845
Sit in a restaurant...

759
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:18,946
You can go to the train station...

760
00:52:18,947 --> 00:52:19,947
Go in.

761
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:23,084
In a word, be more visible!

762
00:52:23,085 --> 00:52:23,785
Yes...

763
00:52:23,795 --> 00:52:25,363
Naturally, you'll have expenses...

764
00:52:25,563 --> 00:52:26,963
Here, take it.

765
00:52:27,198 --> 00:52:28,398
No, no, that's all right, I'll do it myself...

766
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:30,011
Semyon Semyonovich,

767
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:31,512
let's not do anything amateurish!

768
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,423
Here's 500 rubles...

769
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,385
With new ones?

770
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:38,366
Ouch...

771
00:52:59,436 --> 00:53:00,636
What's wrong with your head?

772
00:53:02,126 --> 00:53:03,026
Money!

773
00:53:03,426 --> 00:53:04,826
Semyon Semyonovich...

774
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:06,482
Got it!

775
00:53:07,674 --> 00:53:08,674
Here...

776
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:14,069
What for?

777
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:17,273
Well, as they say, just in case of emergency,

778
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:18,373
take it!

779
00:53:24,753 --> 00:53:26,353
I haven't held a combat weapon since the war...

780
00:53:26,363 --> 00:53:29,463
But it's not a combat weapon, it's more of a psychological one...

781
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:32,395
You can scare them off if you need to,

782
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,417
give a signal...

783
00:53:33,617 --> 00:53:34,817
It's loaded with blanks.

784
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:36,253
Give me a live one!

785
00:53:36,353 --> 00:53:37,253
What for?

786
00:53:38,561 --> 00:53:39,661
Just in case...

787
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:41,348
Don't!

788
00:53:41,648 --> 00:53:42,548
I see...

789
00:53:43,615 --> 00:53:46,615
- Semyon Semyonovich, what are you... Ah!... Oooh...

790
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,290
Uh...?

791
00:54:04,671 --> 00:54:05,871
Uh... ah...?

792
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:07,021
А?

793
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:08,318
That's the way to do it!

794
00:54:08,418 --> 00:54:09,318
Uh-huh...

795
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,280
Fedenka...

796
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,480
and it would be good...

797
00:54:17,386 --> 00:54:18,286
a game.

798
00:54:21,517 --> 00:54:22,417
Let's do...

799
00:54:22,818 --> 00:54:24,418
What shall we drink, vodka, cognac?

800
00:54:24,518 --> 00:54:25,717
I'd like a beer...

801
00:54:26,272 --> 00:54:28,372
All right, we'll start with a bottle of vodka

802
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:29,723
and a bottle of cognac...

803
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:30,923
A couple of beers!

804
00:54:30,924 --> 00:54:31,824
Yes, sir.

805
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:33,325
Oh, I have to call my mother...

806
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:34,825
- I'll be right... - Yeah.

807
00:54:40,716 --> 00:54:42,216
Good evening, Boris Savelyevich,

808
00:54:43,218 --> 00:54:45,679
I've ordered a Fede game...

809
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,920
I beg you very much...

810
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:56,237
Lelik, I'm waiting,

811
00:54:56,937 --> 00:54:58,337
the client will be all right...

812
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:03,093
The chief himself is here,

813
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:05,161
waiting...

814
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:23,121
Available?

815
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:24,659
Occupied!

816
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:32,672
This is it...

817
00:55:32,773 --> 00:55:33,772
Here we go...

818
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,500
Just take it easy,

819
00:55:36,302 --> 00:55:37,502
we have to act...

820
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,430
Can you tell me, please,

821
00:55:42,671 --> 00:55:43,671
where's the phone?

822
00:55:44,804 --> 00:55:45,804
Thank you...

823
00:55:47,284 --> 00:55:48,184
Cab?

824
00:55:48,684 --> 00:55:50,284
This is Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov.

825
00:55:50,484 --> 00:55:51,584
Gorbunkov.

826
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,485
Yes, yes, Gorbunkov.

827
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:56,482
Send a cab to the Weeping Willow Restaurant.

828
00:55:57,588 --> 00:55:58,588
It's urgent.

829
00:55:59,486 --> 00:56:00,486
Thank you.

830
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,367
Well, let's get started, shall we?

831
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,671
No, no, no, I'll have a beer...

832
00:56:07,219 --> 00:56:08,219
No, no...

833
00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:18,661
Yeah, he does,

834
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:20,667
Let him see me drinking.

835
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:22,193
Coo-coo...

836
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:23,644
Here's to your bonus.

837
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:24,954
God forbid it's not your last.

838
00:56:34,752 --> 00:56:36,352
You don't eat after the first one!

839
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:38,058
Vodka...

840
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,930
Here's to your health...

841
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:41,895
Come on!

842
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:51,726
Peek-a-boo!

843
00:56:59,326 --> 00:57:00,326
Drink...

844
00:57:05,161 --> 00:57:06,211
I am convinced

845
00:57:06,212 --> 00:57:07,612
that each and every one of you,

846
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:09,485
when they find the treasure,

847
00:57:10,085 --> 00:57:11,885
will do exactly the same as me!

848
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:13,485
What will you do with the bonus?

849
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,880
With my legal bonus, I,

850
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:19,387
on the advice of my friends,

851
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:21,242
I decided to buy

852
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,050
a Moskvich car.

853
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:24,981
A new model...

854
00:57:28,855 --> 00:57:29,955
I'll be right there!

855
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:36,407
The client is ripening, be ready!

856
00:57:36,408 --> 00:57:37,908
Always ready!

857
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,108
Idiot...

858
00:57:44,956 --> 00:57:45,856
Pardon...

859
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:47,965
Ха-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га!

860
00:57:59,223 --> 00:58:00,223
Who are you here to see?

861
00:58:00,636 --> 00:58:01,566
You!

862
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,010
But?

863
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:04,851
Don't you recognize me?

864
00:58:05,244 --> 00:58:06,344
I don't recognize you...

865
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:08,211
How about a drink?

866
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:10,395
A drink!

867
00:58:23,023 --> 00:58:24,923
I didn't recognize you right away either...

868
00:58:25,722 --> 00:58:27,222
- Yeah? Mm-hmm.

869
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:28,909
Why did you shave off your mustache?

870
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:30,986
What?

871
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:33,215
I said, why did you shave off your mustache, stupid?

872
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:37,383
Who?

873
00:58:38,426 --> 00:58:40,226
Excuse me, with whom do I have the honor?

874
00:58:40,658 --> 00:58:42,258
Ladyzhensky, Yevgeny Nikolayevich,

875
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:43,959
this fool's school friend!

876
00:58:44,347 --> 00:58:46,147
Do you know why Volodya shaved off his mustache?

877
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:47,348
A mustache?...

878
00:58:48,097 --> 00:58:48,997
Senya,

879
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:50,384
Quickly, explain to the comrade,

880
00:58:50,582 --> 00:58:52,872
why Volodya shaved off his mustache.

881
00:58:52,882 --> 00:58:54,682
We don't have much time. Drink!

882
00:58:56,757 --> 00:58:57,857
Senya?

883
00:59:09,034 --> 00:59:10,734
Heh heh heh, heh heh heh!

884
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:13,292
I'm sorry, I was mistaken...

885
00:59:13,786 --> 00:59:15,786
Here's your mustache...

886
00:59:16,283 --> 00:59:17,883
Just like Volodya Trynkin!

887
00:59:17,984 --> 00:59:18,983
Just like him!

888
00:59:18,984 --> 00:59:20,584
Comrade, when is your plane?

889
00:59:21,912 --> 00:59:22,712
Yes...

890
00:59:23,348 --> 00:59:24,148
It's time...

891
00:59:24,248 --> 00:59:26,848
Well, if you come to Kolyma...

892
00:59:29,414 --> 00:59:31,814
If you come to Kolyma, you're welcome.

893
00:59:32,393 --> 00:59:33,893
No, you'd better come with us.

894
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:35,232
Goodbye...

895
00:59:39,468 --> 00:59:40,968
Good thing he's not a smuggler,

896
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,680
A handsome man...

897
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,343
Why did I get so drunk?

898
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:50,762
Senya,

899
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:53,219
Have you come to the point yet?

900
00:59:54,144 --> 00:59:55,544
- To what? - The right one!

901
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:57,267
No...

902
00:59:57,558 --> 01:00:00,558
- One more drink, then! - No, no, no, no, no more... No more!

903
01:00:00,954 --> 01:00:02,154
- I have to! - That's it!

904
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:03,650
Senya...

905
01:00:05,534 --> 01:00:06,934
Do you respect me?

906
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:10,297
I do, but I won't drink!

907
01:00:11,363 --> 01:00:12,757
Then I'll bite you!

908
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:14,830
Bite me!

909
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:16,704
A-gy-gy...

910
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:20,004
Gesha... Gesha... Gesha... Gesha... Gesha...

911
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,629
There are people everywhere!

912
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:23,191
Gesha!

913
01:00:26,619 --> 01:00:27,919
Do you want some game?

914
01:00:28,653 --> 01:00:29,753
With game - I will!

915
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:32,941
Fedya, game!

916
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,660
A game!

917
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:35,561
Shh...

918
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:43,773
Is this a game?

919
01:00:44,384 --> 01:00:45,384
Is this a game?

920
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:46,875
It's game!

921
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,259
- You don't drink vodka with game! - Why?

922
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,259
You drink this... Shh, shh, shh...!

923
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,419
Got it, got it... Fedya! Another 150 champagne, and that's it!

924
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,320
Yes...

925
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:57,821
- Cheers! - Thank you.

926
01:01:00,879 --> 01:01:03,379
I think it's time for you to freshen up...

927
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,943
Senya, it's time to freshen up.

928
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:07,574
Come on, let's go.

929
01:01:07,676 --> 01:01:08,776
- And the game? - Let's go.

930
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:10,176
The game won't fly away, it's fried.

931
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:11,176
Quickly!

932
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:13,375
Senya, don't mess around, quick!

933
01:01:13,475 --> 01:01:15,575
Strictly to the north, about 50 meters ...

934
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:16,675
Hurry up!

935
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:18,515
Well?

936
01:01:22,814 --> 01:01:23,814
Senya!

937
01:01:35,296 --> 01:01:36,796
A song about hares!

938
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:42,874
In the dark blue forest,

939
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,683
Where the aspens tremble,

940
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:48,041
Where the witch hazel oaks

941
01:01:48,462 --> 01:01:50,762
The leaves are falling away.

942
01:01:51,294 --> 01:01:52,933
In the glade the grass

943
01:01:53,033 --> 01:01:55,468
The hares were mowing at midnight

944
01:01:55,593 --> 01:01:58,292
And they sang

945
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:00,661
Strange words.

946
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:06,254
We don't care, we don't care,

947
01:02:06,354 --> 01:02:10,454
We're afraid of the wolf and the owl.

948
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:12,977
We have things to do,

949
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:15,481
♪ In our darkest hour ♪

950
01:02:15,712 --> 01:02:17,663
♪ We're doing the magic ♪

951
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:19,487
We mow the grass.

952
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:22,622
And the witch hazel oaks

953
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,651
Something whispers in the fog.

954
01:02:26,054 --> 01:02:30,354
The shadows of the marshes are rising.

955
01:02:30,722 --> 01:02:32,722
The hares are mowing the grass,

956
01:02:32,822 --> 01:02:34,926
The grass on the meadow

957
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:40,061
And they sing faster and faster out of fear.

958
01:02:40,743 --> 01:02:45,042
We don't care, we don't care,

959
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:49,178
Even if we're afraid of the wolf and the owl.

960
01:02:49,288 --> 01:02:51,551
We have things to do,

961
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:53,712
At the most dreadful hour

962
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:57,738
We're mowing the magic weed.

963
01:02:58,299 --> 01:03:01,978
We don't care, we don't care,

964
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:05,774
♪ We believe in the old saying ♪

965
01:03:05,976 --> 01:03:10,124
The brave one is the one who three times a year,

966
01:03:10,259 --> 01:03:13,503
At the most dreadful hour he mows the weed.

967
01:03:13,649 --> 01:03:17,549
We don't care, we don't care,

968
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:20,902
We'll be braver than two times two,

969
01:03:21,247 --> 01:03:24,786
Let us stand for once in our darkest hour,

970
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:28,070
We'll be in trouble and we'll be in trouble.

971
01:03:42,506 --> 01:03:45,877
And we don't care, and we don't care,

972
01:03:46,012 --> 01:03:49,366
We'll be braver than two times two,

973
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:52,650
We'll stand our ground in the darkest hour,

974
01:03:52,802 --> 01:03:56,402
We'll be a darned sight better than a darned sight.

975
01:04:23,115 --> 01:04:24,115
Well...

976
01:04:25,247 --> 01:04:27,497
We'll have to take action, but what can we do?

977
01:04:27,543 --> 01:04:28,843
Fight drunkenness!

978
01:04:29,216 --> 01:04:31,816
But... You know Varvara Sergeyevna...

979
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:34,416
I know everything more than you do, my dear!

980
01:04:34,624 --> 01:04:36,124
Where did he get the money?

981
01:04:36,692 --> 01:04:39,492
His comrade invited him, he got a bonus.

982
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:40,792
And according to the protocol,

983
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:45,717
your husband paid 97 rubles 18 kopecks for one broken mirror window!

984
01:04:45,817 --> 01:04:47,917
Where did he get that kind of money?

985
01:04:48,901 --> 01:04:50,601
After returning from there...

986
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:52,529
Your husband is different!

987
01:04:53,162 --> 01:04:55,462
The corrupting influence of the West...

988
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:57,659
These toys are idiotic!

989
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,959
And that strange phrase:

990
01:05:00,155 --> 01:05:01,955
"The dog is man's friend"...

991
01:05:03,351 --> 01:05:05,359
Weird, to say the least...

992
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,068
And these are...

993
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:08,368
Elements of the sweet life...

994
01:05:08,568 --> 01:05:10,868
And you know, I wouldn't be surprised

995
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,205
if tomorrow it turns out

996
01:05:13,206 --> 01:05:15,051
that your husband

997
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:18,589
is secretly visiting his mistress!

998
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,889
What?

999
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:25,877
Is this yours?

1000
01:06:26,745 --> 01:06:27,644
It's mine...

1001
01:06:27,824 --> 01:06:28,924
Where's it from?

1002
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:30,789
From there...

1003
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:33,701
From there...

1004
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,790
They took it!

1005
01:06:39,781 --> 01:06:41,181
But how could he?

1006
01:06:42,018 --> 01:06:44,673
Ah, he's so trusting...

1007
01:06:45,078 --> 01:06:47,078
Aaah!... hand...

1008
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:50,449
He was tortured! How could I not have guessed before?

1009
01:06:50,649 --> 01:06:51,649
My goodness!

1010
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:54,751
We don't care...

1011
01:06:57,823 --> 01:06:58,923
What should we do?

1012
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:00,699
And the children?

1013
01:07:01,027 --> 01:07:02,277
What will happen to them?

1014
01:07:02,377 --> 01:07:04,577
Ah-ah! What a shame!

1015
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:09,047
Ah-ah... There's only one way out...

1016
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:11,701
Only one.

1017
01:07:14,778 --> 01:07:15,978
Only one.

1018
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:30,184
That's enough...

1019
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:31,699
That's enough!

1020
01:07:32,476 --> 01:07:34,376
Champagne in the morning

1021
01:07:34,661 --> 01:07:36,860
or aristocrats or degenerates!

1022
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:39,017
Aah!

1023
01:07:41,347 --> 01:07:42,847
Meow, meow, meow!

1024
01:07:47,845 --> 01:07:49,245
Let's go see the chief.

1025
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:53,500
Dressed like that...

1026
01:07:54,193 --> 01:07:55,293
I can't.

1027
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,837
I have to... first...

1028
01:07:59,253 --> 01:08:00,553
take a bath,

1029
01:08:01,218 --> 01:08:02,918
Have a cup of coffee...

1030
01:08:02,919 --> 01:08:04,919
You'll have a va-anna,

1031
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,419
There'll be coffee,

1032
01:08:06,835 --> 01:08:08,635
♪ There'll be a caca and a tea... ♪

1033
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:10,259
Let's go!

1034
01:08:10,907 --> 01:08:11,807
Aah!

1035
01:08:13,108 --> 01:08:14,208
Meow!

1036
01:08:14,209 --> 01:08:15,209
Let's go...

1037
01:08:15,677 --> 01:08:16,677
Gesha...

1038
01:08:19,144 --> 01:08:20,143
Aaah!

1039
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:22,768
Boo!

1040
01:08:27,264 --> 01:08:28,064
А?

1041
01:08:37,066 --> 01:08:37,966
Nadia!

1042
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:39,414
- Senya... - Nadia!

1043
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:41,227
Senya...

1044
01:08:41,754 --> 01:08:44,053
Calm down, calm down!

1045
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:47,254
You have, you have a way out.

1046
01:08:47,255 --> 01:08:48,055
Yes...

1047
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:50,356
You have to go and confess yourself!

1048
01:08:50,456 --> 01:08:51,256
You!

1049
01:08:51,617 --> 01:08:52,517
To what?

1050
01:08:52,617 --> 01:08:53,617
The adultery!

1051
01:09:09,825 --> 01:09:11,325
How could you think such a thing,

1052
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:13,481
you, my wife, the mother of my children!

1053
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,740
Oh, God! Oh, woe is me!

1054
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,937
Why, what was I supposed to think?

1055
01:09:17,938 --> 01:09:20,238
Anything but that!

1056
01:09:20,539 --> 01:09:21,539
Oh, woe is me!

1057
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,740
Oh, woe to me!

1058
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,890
Where did you get the gun and the money?

1059
01:09:25,891 --> 01:09:27,391
Shut up, you wretched woman!

1060
01:09:28,084 --> 01:09:29,084
Shut up!

1061
01:09:29,935 --> 01:09:30,935
Senya!

1062
01:09:33,148 --> 01:09:36,048
Tell me, where did you get the gun and the money?

1063
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:40,620
I'm begging you, Senya, tell me!

1064
01:09:41,183 --> 01:09:42,083
All right...

1065
01:09:42,472 --> 01:09:44,572
I'll tell you, but not a word to anyone!

1066
01:09:44,606 --> 01:09:45,606
I swear!

1067
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:50,613
This is a state secret...

1068
01:09:51,397 --> 01:09:52,497
The gun and the money

1069
01:09:52,893 --> 01:09:55,468
I received for a responsible special mission...

1070
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:57,069
Ah-ah-ah!... Which one?

1071
01:09:57,591 --> 01:09:59,191
I can't tell you that!

1072
01:09:59,192 --> 01:10:00,192
- Aah! - Bye...

1073
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:01,792
When the time comes, you'll find out...

1074
01:10:03,277 --> 01:10:04,477
Maybe I'll even...

1075
01:10:06,505 --> 01:10:07,505
...rewarded...

1076
01:10:11,161 --> 01:10:12,161
posthumously...

1077
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:17,749
That's a great plan, chief.

1078
01:10:18,665 --> 01:10:21,965
It'll be ready by 12:00.

1079
01:10:22,929 --> 01:10:23,929
Genius!

1080
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:43,835
Good afternoon!

1081
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:48,090
F-f! Uge-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga!

1082
01:10:49,675 --> 01:10:50,875
Bonjour!

1083
01:10:51,365 --> 01:10:52,565
Bonjour, madame...

1084
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,650
- Pardon. - Meow!

1085
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:57,897
I am happy to welcome you to this humble, cozy...

1086
01:10:58,987 --> 01:11:00,187
Hello, boy!

1087
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:04,882
I'm from the chief.

1088
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:06,531
It's all set...

1089
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:09,199
Your credentials?

1090
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:11,007
Passport...

1091
01:11:11,407 --> 01:11:12,407
ready!

1092
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:15,257
Where?

1093
01:11:15,258 --> 01:11:16,458
Hotel Atlantic.

1094
01:11:16,658 --> 01:11:18,858
Two-bedroom suite... paid for!

1095
01:11:20,582 --> 01:11:21,582
Customer?

1096
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:24,639
Mm... Face...

1097
01:11:25,371 --> 01:11:26,371
Profile...

1098
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:31,879
Fee?

1099
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,880
Oh...

1100
01:11:35,385 --> 01:11:36,685
For now, a down payment.

1101
01:11:38,862 --> 01:11:40,062
Mhyahu-yah!

1102
01:11:44,974 --> 01:11:48,374
One pill is enough.

1103
01:11:51,983 --> 01:11:53,183
Tell me, please,

1104
01:11:54,757 --> 01:11:57,557
Do you have one without wings?

1105
01:11:57,558 --> 01:11:58,658
Unfortunately, no...

1106
01:11:58,659 --> 01:11:59,859
- No, do you? - No.

1107
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,060
We'll look for it...

1108
01:12:06,988 --> 01:12:08,488
Don't you have one just like it but

1109
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,540
with mother-of-pearl buttons?

1110
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:11,641
Unfortunately, no...

1111
01:12:11,642 --> 01:12:13,542
No, yes... we'll look for it...

1112
01:12:30,883 --> 01:12:32,283
- Are you me? - Yes!

1113
01:12:33,077 --> 01:12:34,477
I'm sorry...

1114
01:12:35,992 --> 01:12:37,192
I heard...

1115
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:39,781
I happen to have what you're looking for...

1116
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:42,610
And it's the one with the mother-of-pearl buttons!

1117
01:12:43,134 --> 01:12:44,714
Only it's at my hotel...

1118
01:12:45,312 --> 01:12:46,812
- Do you really need it? - Yes!

1119
01:12:47,108 --> 01:12:48,638
Then I'll give you the address.

1120
01:12:49,343 --> 01:12:51,342
I live at the Hotel Atlantic.

1121
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:52,842
It's not far from here.

1122
01:12:59,783 --> 01:13:00,683
Hello...

1123
01:13:01,313 --> 01:13:02,863
Is nine o'clock okay with you?

1124
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:04,563
- Yeah. - That's fine!

1125
01:13:05,688 --> 01:13:06,588
You're welcome.

1126
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:10,209
I'll be waiting for you.

1127
01:13:15,248 --> 01:13:16,543
At nine o'clock, at nine o'clock sharp,

1128
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:19,943
Atlantic Hotel, room 327, Anna Sergeyevna...

1129
01:13:20,489 --> 01:13:22,389
Nine o'clock, nine o'clock sharp...

1130
01:13:22,413 --> 01:13:25,013
I smell a real fish in my liver.

1131
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,703
What does she look like?

1132
01:13:26,805 --> 01:13:28,005
- Does it? - Yes.

1133
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:31,041
Oh...

1134
01:13:31,382 --> 01:13:32,282
I see...

1135
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:35,576
Be careful not to repeat yesterday's mistake!

1136
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,376
Ahh... Eh! I don't drink at all.

1137
01:13:37,403 --> 01:13:38,503
A friend invited me.

1138
01:13:38,775 --> 01:13:40,675
By the way, how's he doing after last night?

1139
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:42,125
I don't know, he hasn't called yet.

1140
01:13:42,226 --> 01:13:43,926
- He's a good man... - You think so?

1141
01:13:44,348 --> 01:13:47,748
All right, go to the hotel, act as you see fit.

1142
01:13:47,848 --> 01:13:50,348
Possible accomplices, check it out!

1143
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:51,592
Do you have a weapon on you?

1144
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:55,518
Mental...

1145
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:56,619
They'll hear you.

1146
01:13:56,659 --> 01:13:57,759
Give me a note!

1147
01:14:03,543 --> 01:14:06,143
French, Chanel, Number Five...

1148
01:14:06,243 --> 01:14:07,143
Let's go!

1149
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,480
Ah! ah...

1150
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:42,886
Ta-da-ri, ta-da-ri,

1151
01:14:43,306 --> 01:14:46,805
# Ta-da-ri, rah-rah-ri-ram #

1152
01:14:48,256 --> 01:14:49,256
Where are you going?

1153
01:14:50,335 --> 01:14:51,835
А.. Special mission?

1154
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,480
Be careful, you hear!

1155
01:14:54,565 --> 01:14:56,165
Don't worry, you'll be fine!

1156
01:14:57,019 --> 01:14:57,819
Sen!

1157
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:00,454
Ahhh!

1158
01:15:10,204 --> 01:15:11,004
F-f-f-f!

1159
01:15:12,328 --> 01:15:13,328
Go!

1160
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:38,291
Cleanth has arrived!

1161
01:15:38,691 --> 01:15:39,591
Dobro.

1162
01:15:44,129 --> 01:15:45,129
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

1163
01:15:51,275 --> 01:15:52,875
Five, five, he's in,

1164
01:15:52,975 --> 01:15:53,875
over!

1165
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:56,109
Roger, Roger, Roger!

1166
01:16:10,312 --> 01:16:13,062
Hotel... 327,

1167
01:16:13,919 --> 01:16:15,169
Anna Sergeyevna...

1168
01:16:15,345 --> 01:16:16,545
Nine-zero-zero...

1169
01:16:17,638 --> 01:16:18,538
Haha!

1170
01:16:21,214 --> 01:16:22,564
Yes, yes, come in!

1171
01:16:40,316 --> 01:16:41,316
Ah, here we are...

1172
01:16:41,317 --> 01:16:42,817
- Good evening! Good evening!

1173
01:16:42,818 --> 01:16:44,268
Please sit down, I'll be right with you...

1174
01:17:05,773 --> 01:17:06,873
What's wrong with you?

1175
01:17:07,297 --> 01:17:08,397
What's the matter with you?!

1176
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,531
It's just...

1177
01:17:10,861 --> 01:17:12,761
The cufflink rolled up...

1178
01:17:14,645 --> 01:17:15,445
Here...

1179
01:17:16,097 --> 01:17:17,097
I'm kicking myself!

1180
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:19,297
Oh, you scared me!

1181
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,101
Let me help you...

1182
01:17:25,459 --> 01:17:27,059
I thought something was wrong...

1183
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:29,411
Listen to my heartbeat...

1184
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:31,108
Is it beating?

1185
01:17:33,697 --> 01:17:34,697
Is it beating?

1186
01:17:36,033 --> 01:17:37,133
S-beat.

1187
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:40,008
Follow the signal,

1188
01:17:40,526 --> 01:17:42,526
as soon as he falls asleep, she'll turn out the lights...

1189
01:17:42,835 --> 01:17:44,634
Lelik, what if he leaves now?

1190
01:17:44,734 --> 01:17:47,234
Gesha, would you leave a woman like that?

1191
01:17:47,235 --> 01:17:48,635
I wouldn't, but he's a faithful husband!

1192
01:17:48,636 --> 01:17:50,736
Ooh! As our dear chief says, there is no husband

1193
01:17:50,737 --> 01:17:53,837
who, even for an hour, wouldn't dream of being a bachelor!

1194
01:17:53,838 --> 01:17:56,738
- Ха-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га! - Hee-hee, hee-hee... Hee-hee, hee-hee...

1195
01:17:56,937 --> 01:17:58,337
Watch the signal!

1196
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:30,997
We'd like to talk about... the robe...

1197
01:18:31,927 --> 01:18:34,127
Oh, I didn't tell you,

1198
01:18:34,227 --> 01:18:36,807
a friend should be bringing it over any minute.

1199
01:18:36,907 --> 01:18:38,207
Are you in a hurry?

1200
01:18:38,607 --> 01:18:39,807
No, I'm in no hurry...

1201
01:18:39,908 --> 01:18:41,608
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1202
01:18:45,217 --> 01:18:46,917
How about a glass of wine in the meantime?

1203
01:18:49,653 --> 01:18:50,653
I'd like a...

1204
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:53,002
A beer...

1205
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:57,351
Hm-m-m-m-m... No, just wine!

1206
01:19:06,487 --> 01:19:14,293
The words of love you spoke to me in the city of stone,

1207
01:19:14,393 --> 01:19:21,966
And lanterns with yellow eyes guided us through the fog.

1208
01:19:22,066 --> 01:19:29,752
I have never been able to love so fiercely, so ardently.

1209
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:36,267
In my soul you have inadvertently awakened a volcano.

1210
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:42,881
Help me, help me

1211
01:19:42,882 --> 01:19:45,782
...for our chance acquaintance...

1212
01:19:45,783 --> 01:19:49,415
...call the yellow-eyed night.

1213
01:19:49,426 --> 01:19:50,526
Drink, drink!

1214
01:19:50,882 --> 01:19:51,782
Drink...

1215
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:53,290
Ff...

1216
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:58,718
See the heart perish, ah, perish

1217
01:19:58,918 --> 01:20:04,742
In the fiery lava of love.

1218
01:20:06,978 --> 01:20:09,280
Where's the girl? # Maybe tomorrow I'll...

1219
01:20:09,786 --> 01:20:10,986
What's the use of a girlfriend?

1220
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:13,159
My robe is almost like that one...

1221
01:20:13,864 --> 01:20:15,064
Mm-hmm...

1222
01:20:16,769 --> 01:20:18,069
Take a look!

1223
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:20,570
...drinking and waiting for news.

1224
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:28,324
You called me a clever girl, a sweet girl,

1225
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:34,704
But could not understand that you were joking with a volcano of passions.

1226
01:20:34,804 --> 01:20:42,607
Help me, help me, help me,

1227
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:49,938
Yellow-eyed night call.

1228
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:57,738
See, ah, the heart is dying, ah, dying

1229
01:20:57,838 --> 01:21:00,026
In the fire-breathing lava of love.

1230
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:00,677
In the fire-breathing lava of love. Woof!

1231
01:21:00,678 --> 01:21:04,178
In the fire-breathing lava of love.

1232
01:21:04,952 --> 01:21:12,651
The twilight smells of Jamaican rum, blue and long.

1233
01:21:12,852 --> 01:21:20,152
And the city of stone still drinks and waits for news.

1234
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:27,384
The sunset has once more painted the street with colors that are marvelous.

1235
01:21:29,494 --> 01:21:34,319
...swirling over the volcano of passions.

1236
01:21:34,354 --> 01:21:41,984
Help me, help me, help me,

1237
01:21:42,183 --> 01:21:49,483
Yellow-eyed night call.

1238
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:57,023
See, ah, the heart perishes, ah, the heart perishes.

1239
01:21:57,123 --> 01:21:59,421
In the fiery lava of love.

1240
01:21:59,522 --> 01:22:05,822
It's not my fault! He came of his own accord!

1241
01:22:47,626 --> 01:22:49,726
I saw your "special assignment."

1242
01:22:50,963 --> 01:22:54,863
After such a monstrous lie, I don't want to be with you and I can't be with you!

1243
01:22:56,718 --> 01:22:59,917
I'm sure my children, when they grow up, will understand.

1244
01:23:00,731 --> 01:23:03,531
I'll file for divorce myself. Goodbye!

1245
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:17,124
Good morning, Semyon Semyonovich!

1246
01:23:23,543 --> 01:23:25,443
No, I have to go to Dubrovka immediately.

1247
01:23:25,703 --> 01:23:27,303
That's right, but not now.

1248
01:23:28,392 --> 01:23:30,142
We'll send you a car tomorrow morning,

1249
01:23:30,329 --> 01:23:31,529
the usual cab.

1250
01:23:31,629 --> 01:23:32,782
8 a.m. Is that convenient for you?

1251
01:23:32,828 --> 01:23:34,128
Why not today?

1252
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:37,024
I have a favor to ask of you today.

1253
01:23:37,025 --> 01:23:38,025
What is it?

1254
01:23:38,731 --> 01:23:41,078
You must meet your friend.

1255
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:42,375
What friend?

1256
01:23:42,376 --> 01:23:43,676
Well, the one you were with...

1257
01:23:43,677 --> 01:23:44,677
on a fishing trip, in a restaurant...

1258
01:23:44,678 --> 01:23:45,877
Ah... Gennady Petrovich...

1259
01:23:45,878 --> 01:23:47,278
Uh-huh. You'll meet him,

1260
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:51,004
and casually tell him that tomorrow

1261
01:23:51,204 --> 01:23:53,204
You're leaving for Dubrovka at eight in the morning.

1262
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:54,304
Uh-huh...

1263
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,404
And most importantly, tell him,

1264
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:58,591
also casually, by the way,

1265
01:23:58,822 --> 01:24:01,522
that the day after tomorrow you'll have your cast off.

1266
01:24:03,924 --> 01:24:04,824
Gena?

1267
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:05,970
Yes!

1268
01:24:07,655 --> 01:24:09,200
And why didn't you...

1269
01:24:09,201 --> 01:24:11,701
So as not to scare away bigger fish!

1270
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:21,119
Pardon...

1271
01:24:22,834 --> 01:24:26,034
And the town was drinking spicy cocktails,

1272
01:24:26,035 --> 01:24:28,735
and drank and waited for news.

1273
01:24:28,736 --> 01:24:31,635
- Help me... - You sing well!

1274
01:24:32,585 --> 01:24:35,085
Mm-hmm. Oh, come on... Mhh-ha-ha-ha...

1275
01:24:35,385 --> 01:24:38,835
Please tell me, have you known citizen Gorbunkov S... С.?

1276
01:24:38,935 --> 01:24:40,835
Yes, unfortunately, ten years!

1277
01:24:40,836 --> 01:24:45,936
And what, all these ten years he was drinking, debauched, and, so to say, morally degraded?

1278
01:24:45,937 --> 01:24:47,537
Well, no, you know,

1279
01:24:47,637 --> 01:24:51,112
all that time he's been cleverly disguising himself as a decent man.

1280
01:24:51,113 --> 01:24:52,213
I don't believe him!

1281
01:24:52,214 --> 01:24:54,713
But if you know a man well, you should always believe him.

1282
01:24:54,813 --> 01:24:55,813
Oh, no,

1283
01:24:56,313 --> 01:24:59,215
I think a man should only be trusted as a last resort.

1284
01:24:59,216 --> 01:25:00,916
- You think so? - I do.

1285
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:02,330
Ooh!

1286
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,240
By the way... Who are you?

1287
01:25:06,756 --> 01:25:09,956
Well, I know him from work, let's say, a colleague...

1288
01:25:11,112 --> 01:25:13,612
Right - a drinking buddy!

1289
01:25:17,638 --> 01:25:18,938
Get out of here,

1290
01:25:19,784 --> 01:25:20,784
Misha!

1291
01:25:21,212 --> 01:25:23,112
As you say there, go to the house. Go, go!

1292
01:25:23,113 --> 01:25:24,913
All right, all right, I'll leave now, just one question:

1293
01:25:25,113 --> 01:25:26,813
Tell me, did you fasten it well?

1294
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:29,282
Don't worry, drunkard, you won't break it!

1295
01:25:29,432 --> 01:25:31,032
Now take it off!

1296
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:35,558
Chief, it's all gone. It's all gone.

1297
01:25:35,606 --> 01:25:37,306
The cast comes off, the customer leaves.

1298
01:25:37,406 --> 01:25:39,324
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Blech, blech...

1299
01:25:39,325 --> 01:25:42,225
I'm gonna kill him! I'll wo... м... м... м... м...

1300
01:25:42,427 --> 01:25:43,727
- Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Aah!

1301
01:25:43,728 --> 01:25:45,528
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

1302
01:25:50,973 --> 01:25:52,473
Good morning, Semyon Semyonovich!

1303
01:25:52,676 --> 01:25:54,376
Where are you going so early?

1304
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,116
To my place, to Dubrovka.

1305
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:57,117
Ah...

1306
01:25:58,993 --> 01:26:01,292
Who ordered a cab to Dubrovka?

1307
01:26:01,692 --> 01:26:02,592
Я!

1308
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:05,210
Uh... Get in!

1309
01:26:07,471 --> 01:26:08,971
- I'm off. - Goodbye!

1310
01:26:12,157 --> 01:26:18,757
I met you and all the old things

1311
01:26:19,057 --> 01:26:25,602
In my dead heart came alive...

1312
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:30,405
- I remembered the time... - Couldn't Mikhail Ivanovich come?

1313
01:26:31,212 --> 01:26:33,612
- Golden... - And Volodya?

1314
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:36,229
- And my heart... - Busy...

1315
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:40,330
- And my heart is... - What's your rank?

1316
01:26:40,331 --> 01:26:41,731
What's your rank?

1317
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:44,379
Like Volodya, Lieutenant of the Militia?

1318
01:26:47,466 --> 01:26:48,566
Laitinant.

1319
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:52,070
I'm the senior lieutenant... yeah...

1320
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,380
Comrade Senior Lieutenant,

1321
01:26:54,669 --> 01:26:56,669
may I call you by your rank in front of your wife

1322
01:26:57,033 --> 01:26:58,533
"Comrade Senior Lieutenant"?

1323
01:26:58,616 --> 01:27:00,616
- Yes... - For the sake of respectability, may I?

1324
01:27:00,873 --> 01:27:02,873
Yes... I'll allow it!

1325
01:27:03,211 --> 01:27:04,111
Thank you!

1326
01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:07,795
Make sure you tell her that I did your special assignment

1327
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,488
at the restaurant... and more importantly, in the hotel!

1328
01:27:11,354 --> 01:27:12,694
- Yeah... - So she won't worry,

1329
01:27:13,344 --> 01:27:15,444
- Tomorrow they'll take it off anyway... - Yeah...

1330
01:27:15,699 --> 01:27:17,699
You don't tell her anything about smugglers,

1331
01:27:17,951 --> 01:27:19,351
gold, diamonds...

1332
01:27:21,786 --> 01:27:24,086
No, I can't do that!

1333
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,939
- Comrade Chief... No, I have to consult with the chief!

1334
01:27:28,039 --> 01:27:29,239
With the bosses...

1335
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:32,638
- Michal Ivanovich? - Gee!... with Mikhal Ivanovich.

1336
01:27:34,002 --> 01:27:35,002
Michal...

1337
01:27:35,866 --> 01:27:37,266
Hello Michal Ivanovich!

1338
01:27:38,723 --> 01:27:41,973
Hello, hello, chief, it's me...

1339
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:45,955
Hello, chief, it's me - Lyolik.

1340
01:27:46,255 --> 01:27:47,255
Lyolik!

1341
01:27:48,152 --> 01:27:50,552
He left for Dubrovka, about 20 minutes ago,

1342
01:27:50,752 --> 01:27:53,051
in a cab, a beige Volga.

1343
01:27:53,353 --> 01:27:55,853
28-70 OGO

1344
01:27:56,531 --> 01:27:57,431
Uh-huh...

1345
01:27:57,631 --> 01:28:00,181
I got it, I got it.

1346
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:02,916
The gent on verst 19...

1347
01:28:03,883 --> 01:28:05,383
So, without him...

1348
01:28:05,951 --> 01:28:07,151
А... Got it...

1349
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:11,982
I begin to act, without noise and dust, according to the newly approved plan...

1350
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:13,382
Everything

1351
01:28:22,201 --> 01:28:25,901
- How was it? - Greetings from Michal Ivanovich!

1352
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:27,101
- Thank you. - Heh-heh-heh-heh...

1353
01:28:27,103 --> 01:28:29,403
- Well? - Everything will be all right,

1354
01:28:29,503 --> 01:28:30,603
even better,

1355
01:28:30,703 --> 01:28:32,403
you'll come back to your wife like a cucumber,

1356
01:28:32,503 --> 01:28:35,203
no cast, no dust, no noise.

1357
01:28:35,403 --> 01:28:39,502
- Michal Ivanovich allowed to take the cast off today. - Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1358
01:28:39,768 --> 01:28:41,168
- Did you get it? - Got him!

1359
01:28:41,368 --> 01:28:42,868
- And who is he? - A lout!

1360
01:28:42,869 --> 01:28:45,069
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! - Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1361
01:28:48,838 --> 01:28:50,110
Why go back,

1362
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:51,901
let's not waste time...

1363
01:28:52,049 --> 01:28:54,949
We've got a point on the highway, we'll get the cast off there.

1364
01:28:55,301 --> 01:28:58,101
As our dear chief, Mikhal Ivanovich, says:

1365
01:28:58,201 --> 01:29:00,900
"Make the iron, without leaving the box office!

1366
01:29:00,901 --> 01:29:03,301
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! - Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1367
01:29:03,472 --> 01:29:07,672
Quickly remove the cast, disembowel him, and we'll be all right...

1368
01:29:08,202 --> 01:29:09,402
Comrade Senior Lieutenant,

1369
01:29:09,501 --> 01:29:12,001
I just ask you to take all the valuables according to the inventory!

1370
01:29:12,011 --> 01:29:13,711
What are you talking about? In the proper form:

1371
01:29:13,811 --> 01:29:17,211
inventory, protocol, handed over, accepted, fingerprints...

1372
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:19,511
Ха-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га-га!

1373
01:30:05,238 --> 01:30:07,538
The whole operation will take no more than 15 minutes.

1374
01:30:07,911 --> 01:30:09,110
Let it soak,

1375
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:11,610
while I gather up

1376
01:30:12,431 --> 01:30:13,531
the stuff.

1377
01:30:14,595 --> 01:30:15,495
Business...

1378
01:30:15,595 --> 01:30:17,395
It's a nice setup you got here.

1379
01:30:17,396 --> 01:30:19,296
Yeah, I got to get my claws into it,

1380
01:30:19,796 --> 01:30:20,896
because the brass at

1381
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,340
ordered a change of location,

1382
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:26,390
to relocate,

1383
01:30:27,035 --> 01:30:28,201
so...

1384
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:32,579
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...

1385
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:34,891
Your... Your mustache has come off...

1386
01:30:35,852 --> 01:30:36,852
Thank you...

1387
01:30:37,993 --> 01:30:39,193
Hands up!

1388
01:31:52,124 --> 01:31:54,024
Seven, seven, what do you see on the track?

1389
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:55,583
Report.

1390
01:31:55,684 --> 01:31:57,084
I'm seven, reporting:

1391
01:31:57,988 --> 01:32:01,687
there's a Moloko tanker heading towards town;

1392
01:32:02,386 --> 01:32:03,886
no cab detected,

1393
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,420
continuing survey, over...

1394
01:33:55,723 --> 01:33:59,123
Seven, seven, no beige cab entered Dubrovka,

1395
01:33:59,223 --> 01:34:00,723
check the 45th square!

1396
01:34:09,046 --> 01:34:10,046
Stop!

1397
01:34:11,658 --> 01:34:12,858
Stop!

1398
01:34:13,306 --> 01:34:14,356
Wait a minute!

1399
01:34:21,209 --> 01:34:24,009
- Please, take me to town! - What happened?

1400
01:34:24,943 --> 01:34:27,443
It's a matter of national importance! There may be a chase...

1401
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:29,837
- I'll take you, I'll take you, all right. - Hurry up!

1402
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:32,010
Hurry up!

1403
01:34:32,196 --> 01:34:33,813
I'm still just learning...

1404
01:34:33,913 --> 01:34:35,013
Come on, time!

1405
01:34:35,113 --> 01:34:36,213
Time is money!

1406
01:34:36,308 --> 01:34:39,507
As they say, when you see money, don't waste time.

1407
01:34:39,749 --> 01:34:41,649
Make the iron, don't move away from the cash register!

1408
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:46,030
Hands... uver!

1409
01:34:46,716 --> 01:34:48,251
Wallpaper! I'll kill you!

1410
01:35:04,667 --> 01:35:07,517
Ha, ha, ha! You shouldn't have tried... there are no diamonds!

1411
01:35:07,571 --> 01:35:09,171
- What do you mean? - No, that's all!

1412
01:35:10,527 --> 01:35:12,027
And how do you know they were there?

1413
01:35:12,227 --> 01:35:14,627
And the one with the glued mustache thought they were there too...

1414
01:35:15,087 --> 01:35:17,087
They've been with the police for a long time... Chief!

1415
01:35:18,151 --> 01:35:19,351
Stop!

1416
01:35:19,651 --> 01:35:20,951
Stop, you idiots!

1417
01:35:21,844 --> 01:35:24,243
As an acquaintance of mine used to say,

1418
01:35:25,618 --> 01:35:26,618
a dead man:

1419
01:35:27,034 --> 01:35:29,034
I knew too much...

1420
01:35:29,722 --> 01:35:30,722
Hm-hm-hm...

1421
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:33,910
Five, I'm seven, report:

1422
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:39,200
On a forest road, at high speed, in the direction of the state border,

1423
01:35:39,313 --> 01:35:41,813
a cherry-colored Moskvich is moving,

1424
01:35:42,013 --> 01:35:43,013
Over!

1425
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:48,720
Seven, seven, listen to my command!

1426
01:36:20,808 --> 01:36:21,908
Mama!

1427
01:36:22,008 --> 01:36:24,608
Lelik, stop it, Lelik! Aah! Lelik!

1428
01:36:24,609 --> 01:36:29,060
Calm down, Kozladoev, let's sit down all!

1429
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:37,059
I met you and all the past...
