1
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,043
Hello. Hello, comrades.

2
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,614
To the food block from the navy.

3
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,895
Thank you.

4
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:10,905
- To the Beastmaster. - Thank you.

5
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,155
- Tamer. - Greetings.

6
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,556
- Hello, sailor. - Lector.

7
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,736
- Hello! - Bosun, Bosun, candy.

8
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:21,877
Well, come on.

9
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:26,979
You do look like me.

10
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,599
Oh, shit, look.

11
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,610
Philip Savelyevich,

12
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,531
...how do they know you, these sailors?

13
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,651
Who doesn't know Shuleikin?

14
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,222
- Well, where did you meet them? - In a tropical port at the equator.

15
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:45,142
Oh, tell me about it.

16
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:53,144
Believe it or not ,

17
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,424
...believe it or not,

18
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:58,405
...but it was...

19
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:01,305
...was...

20
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:28,301
Ah, finally!

21
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,052
- Hello. - How do you do? - Shuleikin.

22
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,893
- Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you.

23
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,153
Well, you'll soon be back home, Comrade Shuleikin.

24
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,933
You know, I see Odessa in my dreams.

25
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:38,443
Ah, Odessa-Odessa!

26
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:41,444
- Take the cargo right on deck. - All right.

27
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,065
- Here are the documents. - Thank you.

28
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,095
- Now let's go to the ship. - All right.

29
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,295
I've been waiting for you, darling.

30
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:50,366
The call came unexpectedly last night. I wasn't prepared, here and there!

31
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,567
If, so to speak, I had managed. What a joy, eh!

32
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:57,668
Oh, please tell me, what happened to your escort?

33
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,638
- Malaria. - Ah, malaria!

34
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:01,869
And tell me, what kind of cargo am I supposed to accompany?

35
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:04,179
- If it's not a secret, of course. - Tigers. - Ah, tigers!

36
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,629
The name of the company?

37
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,719
What company?! A pair of lions, ten tigers.

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,840
Like lions?

39
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,461
- Are you serious? - What's bothering you?

40
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,662
- I'm completely unfamiliar with this business. - Well, you'll get to know me.

41
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:19,642
The main thing is not to say anything unnecessary, and everything will be fine.

42
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:22,713
Look, I still want to live.

43
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:24,664
Well, live your life in good health.

44
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,564
- No, I can't! - You can't what?

45
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:32,095
You want to sit here until the next ship for another five months?

46
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,245
No, I can't! No, I can't! I just can't!

47
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:38,427
- Did you find the boy or what?! Take the papers!

48
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:41,037
No! No and no! Here are your papers.

49
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:44,437
- Follow me, please! - No, no, no, no! Please sit down!

50
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,368
- Please follow me. - Please sit down.

51
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:49,568
What do you mean...?

52
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,379
- I am not persuading you. - I forbid them to order you!

53
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,750
I forbid you to persuade me!

54
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,021
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

55
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:03,501
- Wait! Well?

56
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,002
- Wait! What?

57
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:08,653
- I'm afraid of what might happen. - Nothing's going to happen.

58
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:11,293
Just don't interfere. I'll take care of it myself.

59
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:12,414
- You will?! - Yes!

60
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:13,944
- Listen to me! - Well?

61
00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:16,815
- I'd like to... Come on! Take it easy, take it easy.

62
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:21,935
The cargo has arrived, Comrade Captain. You can take it.

63
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:23,806
Ah-ah-ah, very good!

64
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,346
And I confess, I thought we were going home with incomplete cargo.

65
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:30,687
- What kind of cargo? - Deck cargo. Twelve seats.

66
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:32,308
Uh-huh.

67
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,618
What kind of cargo, anyway?

68
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,411
- So, you said 12 seats?! - Yes, yes, 12 seats.

69
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:49,302
Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:51,282
Come on, come on!

71
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:55,563
Come on! And one! And two!

72
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:00,444
XO!

73
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:05,455
What's that?

74
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,185
Excuse me!

75
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:09,606
Now he's going to say to me:

76
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:13,957
"And I'll ask you not to distract the crew during working hours."

77
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,869
And I ask you not to distract the team during working hours.

78
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:25,599
And I'm admonishing you.

79
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,791
- So we're loading? - Yes, yes, of course.

80
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:35,161
All right!

81
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,632
What's that on your head?

82
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:38,782
Oh, it's just a hairdo.

83
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:42,153
It's called "I'm Mama's Fool." Why?

84
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,993
It's a pity that the form corresponds to the content.

85
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:46,494
Now take that disgrace off!

86
00:06:46,803 --> 00:06:48,304
- Well, you know what...! - Comrade barmaid,

87
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,065
... If you like to wear ...

88
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,325
... A mop on his head - wear it. Just not during office hours.

89
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,025
- Ð¯!.. - And I'll ask you not to bicker.

90
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,246
I'm not bickering either!

91
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,426
I can see by your face that you're bickering.

92
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,037
What, you see with the back of your head, right?

93
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:02,817
Comrade barmaid, stop bickering.

94
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:05,498
- I'm not bickering yet! - And I say you're bickering!

95
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,588
- No, I'm not! - Silence!

96
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:11,679
Oleg Petrovich, please. The loading is about to begin.

97
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,910
- Keep an eye out. - All right.

98
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,840
My sister asked me to take you on a voyage.

99
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:21,511
I thought the sea would make a man out of you.

100
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:23,212
- Well, I... And even in the end...

101
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:25,142
...to do something seriously.

102
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,422
I'm sick of everything!

103
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:29,063
And your sea is disgusting and your ship is disgusting and...

104
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,793
...and your Oleg, uh, nasty Petrovich!

105
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:33,884
Oleg Petrovich is strict, but fair.

106
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,024
Lives according to the system.

107
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:36,474
He picks on me.

108
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,704
He does not pay attention to me at all.

109
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:41,105
Well, you contradict yourself.

110
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,526
I beg you, stop quarreling with him.

111
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:48,037
May this silly war between you and the senior assistant come to an end.

112
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:51,327
May there be peace and quiet in the team.

113
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,299
What is this?

114
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,060
Who authorized it?

115
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,722
- Oh! - What are you, Maryushka!?

116
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:14,312
Vira! (up).

117
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,043
What-what, what are you looking at?!

118
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,214
You haven't seen a tiger, have you?!

119
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:28,015
What if they find out I'm not a tamer, but a caterer?

120
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:30,416
You yourself asked to take the place of a sick attendant.

121
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:33,647
I asked, I asked because I can't in their climate.

122
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:34,987
I'm melting like a candle.

123
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:37,077
And I can't keep any more animals I've bought here.

124
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,968
I'm forbidden by the salesman.

125
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:43,179
They eat up all the currency.

126
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:45,599
They gobble up a horse a day for foreign currency.

127
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,629
And on top of that, each tiger is worth 40,000 in gold.

128
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:49,530
Are you kidding?!

129
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,110
Stop twirling!

130
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,620
The hell he knows!

131
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,161
I used to work quietly and peacefully in the bargain buffet.

132
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:59,502
It was the most atrocious thing I ever dealt with,

133
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,173
...I was cutting Amateur sausage. And all of a sudden...

134
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:03,902
Lions.

135
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,264
Tigers.

136
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,614
- You let me down, comrades. - What's the matter?!

137
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:10,535
If I knew the nature of the cargo...

138
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:11,954
Don't worry, Comrade Captain.

139
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,235
What do you mean, don't worry, don't worry.

140
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,155
Once we were carrying giraffes from Hamburg.

141
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,466
- And what? - Suddenly, one of them got a neck rubbing.

142
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,947
- A chafing? What do you mean, rubbed? - Yes, yes it did, why are you laughing?

143
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:21,737
It's a scandal! We're still reporting back.

144
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:24,407
Don't worry! Our animals' necks won't break.

145
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,438
- Have a good voyage, Comrade Captain. - Goodbye.

146
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,408
Here, meet Comrade Shuleikin.

147
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,569
A very experienced tamer.

148
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,958
A hunter.

149
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,240
Always works alone.

150
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:37,170
He will accompany the cargo and feed the animals.

151
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,371
Very nice to meet you.

152
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:42,931
It's a heroic job you do.

153
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:44,802
It'll be easier with you.

154
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,642
Don't worry about worrying.

155
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:49,953
This way! (This way.)

156
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,274
Oh, this place will zoo. (This place will be a zoo.)

157
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:56,254
Please, put bag right here and you may go home. (Put the bag right here and you may go home.)

158
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:57,424
All right. (All right.)

159
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:02,015
Our company is happy to have your affaires. (Our company is happy to have your affaires.)

160
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:04,716
...and want to do this small present. (...and wants to make this small present.)

161
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:05,946
And what is this?

162
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:07,976
Well, he says it's kind of like a bonus...

163
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:10,067
...to a wholesaler from the firm.

164
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,388
Good bye, sir. Good bye.

165
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:14,478
- Good bye. - Good bye.

166
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,709
- What's in the bag? - I don't know. I don't know.

167
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,409
Allow me,

168
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,230
...where's the bag?

169
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:26,780
Who knows!

170
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:30,381
He couldn't have gotten away by himself, could he?

171
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:32,191
- Ð?! - Yes, of course he couldn't!

172
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,653
Aaaaah!

173
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:40,713
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

174
00:10:42,364 --> 00:10:44,974
What did you take me for a tiger, Marinochka?!

175
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,765

362
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:16,382
Excuse me.

363
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:18,782
What's wrong, uncle?

364
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:20,253
I'm not your uncle anymore!

365
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:23,294
Now I know who's been making all the trouble on the ship.

366
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:26,584
- Uncle, I didn't do anything! - You didn't do anything?!

367
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:29,225
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to my uncle.

368
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,705
- I'm not your uncle anymore! - And I didn't do anything!

369
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:35,436
And who started the pogrom in Oleg Petrovich's cabin?!

370
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:37,227
- It wasn't you, was it? - It wasn't me!

371
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:39,396
- Then who did!? Tell me who, who! - I don't know!

372
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:47,749
Half-heartedly!

373
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:07,113
Let go! Ew! Let me go, damn it! Ew!

374
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:16,085
So much for the bonus from the company!

375
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:18,845
Catch and drown immediately!

376
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,436
A monkey on a ship is scarier than dynamite.

377
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:24,727
Where's the tamer?

378
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,428
Comrade Tamer, come here.

379
00:23:32,748 --> 00:23:35,779
Comrade tamer, catch it.

380
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,260
- Who? - A macaque!

381
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,550
I don't deal with monkeys.

382
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,841
Give me a tiger, a lion, this... a leopard.

383
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,482
At the very least, I'll take the crocodile,

384
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:48,682
...but no macaque.

385
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:49,771
Pity!

386
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:51,102
Pity!

387
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:53,702
Well, comrades, will catch organized.

388
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,124
According to the system - half of the team...

389
00:23:56,343 --> 00:24:00,134
...with the chief mate to starboard.

390
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:03,304
I'm going port side.

391
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:05,516
- Open two hatches! - Yes, sir!

392
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,545
That way, strategically...

393
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:10,326
...it will inevitably go through the hatch into the hold.

394
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:13,647
Bosun and cook, get ready in the hold with the tarp.

395
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:16,767
And as soon as the macaque falls into the hold on the bales..,

396
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:18,268
...you pop it.

397
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,528
Right?!

398
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:21,449
- You got it? - All right! Let's go!

399
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:36,021
There she is!

400
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,832
Look, in my tank top.

401
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:41,482
Catch it! Catch her, catch her!

402
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:43,953
Get her! Catch her!

403
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:46,744
There she is! There! There! There!

404
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:48,104
Ð!

405
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,914
You got it!

406
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,675
Got her!

407
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:54,735
Hey, that's it! You got it!

408
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:55,996
He can't run now.

409
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,416
He can't run now!

410
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,078
Be quiet!

411
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:06,468
Be quiet!

412
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:09,309
The captain will come - he'll show you how to put nuts in your borscht.

413
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,770
Ah-ah-ah!

414
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:18,561
And what did we catch?!

415
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,681
It's moving.

416
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:22,902
Open up!

417
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:26,892
- Careful, careful! - Quiet! Quiet!

418
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:31,203
Comrade Captain, is that you?

419
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,126
There you are!

420
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:50,018
A gift from the firm.

421
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:56,029
Do you know you've been ordered drowned?!

422
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,580
What am I gonna do with you, buddy?!

423
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,221
[Knock on door]

424
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,412
Be quiet!

425
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:14,362
Come in.

426
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,033
Oleg Petrovich,

427
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:20,104
...I keep thinking about that damned macaque.

428
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:24,005
- Where should we look for her? - There's no need to look for her anymore!

429
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:25,475
I threw it...

430
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:29,216
...and threw it over the fence. - You did? Yes!

431
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,246
On your orders.

432
00:26:31,526 --> 00:26:33,197
Well, you're a man of iron.

433
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,227
I probably couldn't.

434
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:39,578
What's that?

435
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:42,669
It's a broken mirror.

436
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,130
Although I felt like I had some kind of weird ,

437
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,261
...strange expression on my face and like I wasn't shaving.

438
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:57,682
Well..,

439
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:00,722
...I came to talk about your, about your report.

440
00:27:01,473 --> 00:27:03,253
Now that it's finally established ,

441
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:05,343
...that it wasn't Marianne who was on the boat at all.

442
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:07,243
So what?

443
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:08,974
I don't have to apologize to her.

444
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:11,955
Why not? She's trying very hard to be good.

445
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:14,705
I will not apologize! No way!

446
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:18,996
- It's not pedagogical. - I have my principles.

447
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,307
No woman would ever expect that from me.

448
00:27:21,677 --> 00:27:24,208
If you must know, she's worse than a monkey to me.

449
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:27,498
Excuse me!

450
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:29,919
You're welcome.

451
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:35,439
You insensitive log!

452
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,281
Oooh-ooh, I'm gonna get my revenge on that guy!

453
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,621
Now, I keep telling you, in order not to be discovered..,

454
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:45,212
...the door must always be locked.

455
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:50,283
You open it only to me, on three knocks.

456
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:52,124
One, two, three.

457
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:53,904
On three, on three.

458
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:56,525
Do you understand me?!

459
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:04,326
Well, watch me again. Here, I run up and knock - one, two, three.

460
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:07,867
I run up - open the latch!

461
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:11,177
And get a piece of sugar.

462
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:16,588
One, two, three - try it!

463
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:23,130
Well done!

464
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:29,181
Marishka, go to the pantry - we need peppers.

465
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,962
- And the mouse! - Come on, come on! Come on!

466
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:49,655
Motya, be a friend and go to the pantry for some peppers.

467
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,546
Go by yourself. Don't be afraid.

468
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:54,087
There's no mouse in there. I've taken care of it.

469
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,147
Yes, there is! I saw it myself.

470
00:28:57,537 --> 00:28:59,128
Mitya dear, go.

471
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:01,998
Actually, I don't have much respect for mice either.

472
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:07,149
But for you, I'm willing to do anything.

473
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,461
As you go in - on the left shelf. There's a yellow can like that.

474
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,461
The switch is on the left.

475
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:22,173
Well!

476
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:26,964
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

477
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:31,585
- Ow! - Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

478
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:38,106
What's in there?

479
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:39,497
It's all right.

480
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:41,947
Where did the mousetraps come from?

481
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:45,807
I put them there. Only I didn't put them on Motya, I put them on the mouse.

482
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:51,899
Oh, thank you, Motya. And I'll kiss you for your bravery.

483
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,820
I sent a radiogram,

484
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,441
...to have you reinstated as captain again.

485
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,921
- How do you feel about that? - I look at it very negatively.

486
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,182
I'm sorry, what did you say?

487
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:06,442
A half-breed!

488
00:30:06,992 --> 00:30:08,723
Animal tracks!

489
00:30:15,294 --> 00:30:16,444
Footprints!

490
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,246
Maybe it's not a tiger trail?

491
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:27,636
Whose is it?! A man's?!

492
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:42,319
Or maybe it's...

493
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,621
Don't play dumb with me!

494
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:54,382
Who told you to let the tigers out at night, huh!

495
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,312
What for? Let him tell me why.

496
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:10,486
Yes, fellow sailors, I do.

497
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:13,077
Every night.

498
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:17,987
The tigers need to walk so they don't get rickets.

499
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:19,957
And at night I herd them.

500
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:21,859
I have insomnia anyway.

501
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,729
- That's all. - That's it?! No, that's not all!

502
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:26,979
If you let them out again..,

503
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:30,210
...I'll put you in the box where the anchor chains are kept.

504
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,890

505
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:37,152
And you, Oleg Petrovich, a strict reprimand with a note in your personal file.

508
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:06,768
...I'm ready to be punished.

509
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:08,998
Please put me under arrest.

510
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:10,608

511
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:12,949

512
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:17,850

That's it. Well done!

518
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:52,317
Now be careful.

519
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,547

00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:02,848
Keep your distance.

540
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,918
It's not me, it's a jock.

541
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:07,919
Tell me, why did you do that?

542
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:10,290
Because I can't stand you.

543
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,330
Knight!

544
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,451
[Laughs]

545
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:23,103
You could throw me overboard like a monkey.

546
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:25,193
You can do it!

547
00:36:25,473 --> 00:36:28,263
Ooh, sea monster! Let me go!

548
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:29,933
Ouch!

549
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:42,076
Marishka, come out to the penalty works.

550
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:53,919
Comrade Captain,

551
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:57,770
...we are a delegation from the team.

552
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,831
About the barmaid. We want it ... to bail her out.

553
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:03,451
- No way! - She's just fun.

554
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:05,951
What's that got to do with hanging her from a rope?

555
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:09,382
Get the prisoner out of your mind.

556
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:17,123
Aah!

557
00:37:18,354 --> 00:37:20,055
- You're leaving?! - None of your business!

558
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:22,505
And because of you, I could have unwittingly suffered.

559
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:27,506
"Shall I fall, pierced by an arrow?"

560
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:29,807
"Or shall it fly by?"

561
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:34,208
"Like a fleeting vision."

562
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:35,768
What's the wooing?

563
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,328
Is it forty percent?

564
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,809
What a man!

565
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:43,319
A tamer of beasts, and he even understands cooking.

566
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,319
And you, teach or not.

567
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,941
And who approves the layout?

568
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,451
- Oleg Petrovich. - Serious fellow.

569
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:56,412
The captain's a bit more reticent against him.

570
00:37:56,852 --> 00:38:00,593
But he was a captain. Even on this ship.

571
00:38:01,253 --> 00:38:02,813
Yes, he was demoted.

572
00:38:03,204 --> 00:38:05,014
What was that for? The revision?

573
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:07,774
The passenger.

574
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:11,766
He fell head over heels in love with her, and she...

575
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:14,126
...and she was messing with his head.

576
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:18,867
She was beautiful. An artist by profession.

577
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:21,877
So we're walking up to the pier.

578
00:38:22,878 --> 00:38:25,918
And the passenger walks up to him on the bridge.

579
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:28,279
And she says, "Well, well, well.

580
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:30,790
It's a mistake, a mutual misunderstanding.

581
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:33,440
I forgot to tell you that I am married."

582
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,011
Oleg Petrovich is standing in a daze, and the ship is full speed ahead.

583
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:43,803
So we are at full throttle and cut into the pier nose.

584
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:47,703
That's how his captaincy ended.

585
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,684
Yes, so the man suffered for love.

586
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,964
What's love got to do with it?

587
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:55,585
Maybe it was just a momentary infatuation.

588
00:39:00,486 --> 00:39:02,406
What have you done, you wicked thing!

589
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:04,277
Aah!

590
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:05,977
It's boiling!

591
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:09,037
Well, tell me, what good are you in life!

592
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,518
Nothing but harm!

593
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:17,570
Marishka,

594
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:24,341
...brought lunch.

595
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:26,872
Bring it back, I'm going on a hunger strike.

596
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,912
I demand the XO come here.

597
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:33,613
Until he comes, I won't eat anything!

598
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:37,124
All right.

599
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:41,135
Knysh, Knysh,

600
00:39:42,395 --> 00:39:44,176
...what's the compote today?

601
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,825
- Peaches. - All right, let's have the compote.

602
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:52,137
And for the rest - a hunger strike!

603
00:39:54,257 --> 00:39:56,548
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

604
00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:58,688
Oh, mothers, help me! Aaaaah!

605
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,559
Found it, you little devil!

606
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,710
Why do you keep following me?!

607
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:13,452
Why did you call me?

608
00:40:15,712 --> 00:40:18,743
I want to apologize for everything.

609
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:24,123
I always knew you were a foolish,

610
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:27,245
...meaningless, good-for-nothing girl.

611
00:40:27,835 --> 00:40:29,525
But today I realize that you're willing...

612
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:32,455
...you're willing to grovel to get out of here.

613
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:34,906
Is that all you got?

614
00:40:35,326 --> 00:40:36,666
Oh, you,

615
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,386
...the great Oleg!

616
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:42,238
Ouch!

617
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,058
I'm sorry.

618
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,921
Come on, I'll feed you, feed you...

619
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:05,082
You'll grow up big as a tiger, you'll go chew him up, you fool!...

620
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:08,873
...if he doesn't understand that I love him!...

621
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,304
...and I'm ruining my relationship with him!

622
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:02,005
Oh, you're stupid, buddy.

623
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:08,816
I think I'm even stupider.

624
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:13,217
Close the door behind me! Do you hear me?

625
00:42:38,653 --> 00:42:40,473
Oleg Petrovich, may I see you?

626
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:42,833
No, lie down, lie down.

627
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,974
I came to you not as a subordinate, but as a person to a person.

628
00:42:47,855 --> 00:42:50,024
I keep thinking about Marianne.

629
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:53,975
Am I being too hard on her?

630
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:56,776
True, she had a difficult childhood.

631
00:42:56,776 --> 00:42:58,566
Difficult, in fact, for her parents.

632
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:03,648
I agree, I agree: bad! It's very bad that she...

633
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,979
...she didn't find her place in life, but...!

634
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:11,340
What does the great Pistalozzi say? Do you remember, I read you excerpts?

635
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,371
"The circumstances form the human being."

636
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:21,482
Work! That's what will save Marianne.

637
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:26,512
The same noble work that turned a monkey into a man.

638
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:32,914
What's that? What?!

639
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:35,244
Ð?!

640
00:43:36,935 --> 00:43:38,506
Ð!

641
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:57,909
[One, two, three! One, two, three...

642
00:43:57,909 --> 00:44:01,210
Bug! Give me a sample, please!

643
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:39,428
[One, two, three! One, two, three...

644
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,249
Footprints!

645
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,431
Ha-ha! Marishka's doing it again.

646
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:42,641
She's such a jerk! Well, you're lying. You can't buy it. You know...

647
00:45:44,932 --> 00:45:46,753
Paludndra!

648
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:52,374
I'll burn! Tigers!

649
00:45:54,634 --> 00:46:10,528
[African tune, drums]

650
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:12,378
Hmm...

651
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:19,379
Hmm! Strange things are happening on this ship.

652
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:25,941
Hand...

653
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:36,783
Take five right.

654
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:48,776
Oleg Petrovich, I must be unwell.

655
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:52,917
- What happened? - I was just in your cabin and it seemed to me...

656
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:56,127
- You imagined what? - No, nothing!

657
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:59,518
Everything seems to me lately.

658
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:11,450
[Oleg Petrovich!

659
00:47:16,122 --> 00:47:18,102
- Mommy-mommy!

660
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:23,663
Shoo! Run to the radio operator, let him notify the crew and the tamer. Shoo!

661
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:31,635
Too late! We're surrounded!

662
00:47:33,365 --> 00:47:35,245
Get out through the porthole.

663
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:46,398
[Whispers]: Oleg Petrovich...

664
00:48:07,372 --> 00:48:10,263
Hey, on watch! That's a hell of a lay-up!

665
00:48:18,835 --> 00:48:22,075
The old man is angry. He's gone completely mad.

666
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:28,387
I didn't understand you! Say that again!

667
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:42,990
- Orlov, run and give the alarm! - I'm far away! Get us down!

668
00:48:57,493 --> 00:48:59,783
M-m-mommy!

669
00:49:37,782 --> 00:49:42,963
Comrades, give me something to eat! I call off the hunger strike!

670
00:49:42,963 --> 00:49:46,853
You forgot about me! Of course, you are well there!

671
00:50:01,617 --> 00:50:04,128
Where are you going? Take the stove away!

672
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:53,248
Oh, you guys! Ow!

673
00:50:54,528 --> 00:50:58,078
Everybody, everybody! Repeat: The animals are out of their cages!

674
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:02,440
Here you go, here you go! I haven't passed it on yet.

675
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,430
- Hold on, don't let go! - Push!

676
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,071
Get on! Spit out the cigarette, it's in your way.

677
00:51:09,071 --> 00:51:11,242
You're used to throwing it on the deck.

678
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:14,593
Come on! Spit it out! Spit it out!

679
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,733
He's twisting!

680
00:51:18,463 --> 00:51:22,044
Comrade Shuleikin, put the animals back in their cages!

681
00:51:22,734 --> 00:51:25,174
[Left and right...

682
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:30,176
Ugh!

Hold it, hold it! I haven't got the message yet!

684
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:42,738
Oh, brothers! He's drooling from his fangs!

685
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:48,320
Burning! Spit, spit! Pick it up! Pick it up!

686
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,150
- Spit, I command you! - Ugh!

687
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,291
My mouth is dry! No saliva!

688
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,892
- Oh, I can't! - Where are you going?!

689
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:03,523
Comrades, he's coming out!

690
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:05,723
Where are you going?!

691
00:52:11,155 --> 00:52:13,795
Where have you led! Get back!

692
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:18,436
Run!

00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:24,025
- Rrrr! - Excuse me.

715
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:43,780
Damn you to hell!

716
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:56,242
Brothers, half-heartedly!

717
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,013
- There he is! Brothers! - Finally!

718
00:56:45,013 --> 00:56:48,874
- Comrade tamer, help me out! - Let the tamer through!

719
00:56:48,874 --> 00:56:51,324
Don't! Yes, comrades, let go! Do not!

720
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:56,325
Do not! Don't! Ah-ah-ah!

721
00:56:57,385 --> 00:56:59,746
Open up! Open up, I said!

722
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:11,901
You miserable creature! You don't know what a bosun is yet.

723
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:18,092
You can't eat me like that without a dick!

724
00:58:28,074 --> 00:58:32,095
Alexei Stepanovich, didn't you forget to close the door?

725
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:36,867
Comrade tamer, why are you here?

726
00:58:37,337 --> 00:58:41,327
Why? Because I don't want to be a steak.

727
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:43,718
Come here!

728
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:46,539
- These are your animals, aren't they? - They're mine.

729
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:48,900
I see. Well, they're not mine.

730
00:58:49,089 --> 00:58:51,030
What's wrong with you?! Are you crazy?!

731
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:53,480
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

732
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:00,262
Come on, tame it! Come on!

733
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:03,843
Let go! Open it! You can't do that! It's cruel!

734
00:59:05,693 --> 00:59:06,983
Don't do it, kitty!

735
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:16,905
Ahhhh!

736
00:59:17,885 --> 00:59:19,606
That tickles! Aaaaah!

737
00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:35,279
Scram! Scat, you striped devils!

738
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:37,039
Scat!

739
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,810
Ah-m-m-m!

740
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:47,461
Uncle, what happened?!

741
00:59:48,562 --> 00:59:51,322
Ouch! We're drowning, aren't we?!

742
00:59:54,783 --> 00:59:57,384
Get off me! I won't do it again!

743
01:00:03,886 --> 01:00:05,895
What are you doing?! Put that down!

744
01:00:06,086 --> 01:00:08,096
Who let you! Don't, don't!

745
01:00:08,286 --> 01:00:09,826
Ew! Scram! Ala gop!

746
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:12,427
Don't do that, don't do that, don't be naughty!

747
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,478
Shoo! I'll forgive you - scram!

748
01:00:15,758 --> 01:00:17,638
Get the water off, damn it!

749
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:22,259
Aaah! Stop it! Aaah!

750
01:01:27,193 --> 01:01:32,664
[Monkey Squeak]

751
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:45,157
Why isn't the shift going on?

752
01:01:45,597 --> 01:01:47,237
Are they slaughtering a goat or something!

753
01:01:47,857 --> 01:01:50,627
So you said you lived on Deribasovskaya,

754
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:52,638
...ah, comrade tamer.

755
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:56,749
Full speed ahead!

756
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,390
Full back!

757
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:12,102
It's coming! Hooray!

758
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,593
Hooray!

759
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:24,385
Hooray!!!

760
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,933
I am the world-famous...

761
01:03:01,183 --> 01:03:03,193
...Chokolani the animal trainer.

762
01:03:05,584 --> 01:03:07,054
Where there's a tiger!

763
01:03:07,524 --> 01:03:09,445
I'll steal it!

764
01:03:12,265 --> 01:03:15,816
Ooh la la le! Ha! Ha!

765
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:34,130
Go down to the deck...

766
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:37,611
...and cage the beasts.

767
01:03:38,211 --> 01:03:40,251
No! You can't tame it!

768
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:46,253
Wild tiger! We've got to ping-pong! Gun, artillery!

769
01:03:47,943 --> 01:03:49,294
Full speed ahead!

770
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:51,933
Schneller, schneller! (Hurry, hurry!)

771
01:03:52,523 --> 01:03:54,224
Let's pay with currency!

772
01:03:54,635 --> 01:03:56,075
Schneller! (quickly).

773
01:03:56,325 --> 01:03:59,716
- You're a coward! - I'm not a coward - but I'm afraid!

774
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:04,427
Don't, Tiger! (tiger).

775
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:08,917
Let go! I'll complain!

776
01:04:09,668 --> 01:04:12,879
You're not a tiger - you're a pig!

777
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:19,119
Fly, fly! Schneller! (Quickly).

778
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,070
Where! Where!

779
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,901
Tamer!

780
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,161
Fake!

781
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:50,376
Uncle, what happened?

782
01:04:52,216 --> 01:04:53,436
Guys!

783
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:57,227
Oh, okay.

784
01:05:04,829 --> 01:05:06,920
Long live freedom!

785
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,364
Hey, helicopter!

786
01:05:25,613 --> 01:05:27,404
Hey, hey, hey!

787
01:05:28,545 --> 01:05:30,775
Take it for a ride!

788
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:36,816
Ouch!

789
01:05:37,036 --> 01:05:39,017
Run! Run, Marishka!

790
01:05:41,497 --> 01:05:45,258
Woman, Marishka's on deck! Save her!

791
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:47,379
Save her!

792
01:05:47,598 --> 01:05:49,239
I'm coming to help!

793
01:06:09,913 --> 01:06:11,363
Aaaaah!

794
01:06:12,114 --> 01:06:13,174
Aaaaaaaaah!

795
01:06:25,907 --> 01:06:27,917
You're my striped one.

796
01:06:29,858 --> 01:06:31,087
Kitty.

797
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:36,359
Kitty.

798
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,400
Pssh-pssh!

799
01:06:43,231 --> 01:06:45,831
You're not scary at all.

800
01:06:50,002 --> 01:06:52,932
- I don't get it! - And you won't!

801
01:06:54,742 --> 01:06:56,223
Step away from the beast now.

802
01:06:56,443 --> 01:06:58,924
- He'll eat you! - None of your business!

803
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:02,324
- Get out of here! Go away yourself!

804
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:04,385
Ooh, that's quite a command.

805
01:07:04,995 --> 01:07:06,245
Don't argue.

806
01:07:07,695 --> 01:07:08,725
You poor baby.

807
01:07:09,506 --> 01:07:11,266
The XO scratched you.

808
01:07:14,467 --> 01:07:16,587
Marishechka, hold this beast.

809
01:07:18,418 --> 01:07:20,148
I have to go to the cabin.

810
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:23,219
Get out, get out. I'll hold him.

811
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,329
Well, get in, get in.

812
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,960
Run before they come to their senses.

813
01:07:32,411 --> 01:07:34,331
I won't!

814
01:07:38,792 --> 01:07:40,072
Hey, don't you dare!

815
01:07:41,322 --> 01:07:42,633
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

816
01:07:43,163 --> 01:07:45,283
Hold the cage! I'm going!

817
01:07:45,674 --> 01:07:48,264
It's deep! Everybody save me!

818
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:54,365
There's reefs right up ahead!

819
01:07:54,776 --> 01:07:56,366
Somebody get to the helm.

820
01:07:57,146 --> 01:07:58,346
Come on!

821
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:11,719
Stop the cage! Help me, stop the cage!

822
01:08:12,029 --> 01:08:14,559
It's deep! I can't swim!

823
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,430
What's going on?!

824
01:08:35,794 --> 01:08:38,155
I'll put a bandage on my paw and make it go away.

825
01:08:40,195 --> 01:08:41,365
You're my good boy.

826
01:08:41,645 --> 01:08:43,726
Don't worry, he won't hurt you again.

827
01:08:43,926 --> 01:08:44,816
No.

828
01:08:45,346 --> 01:08:47,016
What are you doing here?

829
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,497
Look how shaggy you are.

830
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:52,588
What's that on your head?

831
01:08:53,848 --> 01:08:55,658
It's out of fashion these days.

832
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:56,989
Let me comb your hair.

833
01:08:57,469 --> 01:08:58,689
Comrade barmaid,

834
01:09:00,059 --> 01:09:00,999
...what are you doing?

835
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,730
Hair...

836
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,180
... "I'm daddy's fool."

837
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,561
Ask the XO for a headscarf.

838
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,432
You'll be tying it on duty time.

839
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:15,822
Next!

840
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:21,734
Well, big boy, will you listen to me now?

841
01:09:22,654 --> 01:09:25,354
Let the XO try to growl at me.

842
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,606
Leave the deck now.

843
01:09:28,386 --> 01:09:31,366
You're coming with me on the penalty duty, you'll be peeling potatoes.

844
01:09:31,847 --> 01:09:33,017
Listen, Marishka,

845
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,467
...for God's sake, try to put them in cages.

846
01:09:36,077 --> 01:09:37,697
I have a team to feed.

847
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:39,338
Serves you right!

848
01:09:39,728 --> 01:09:41,758
You're all under arrest now.

849
01:09:42,018 --> 01:09:42,708
Here.

850
01:09:43,128 --> 01:09:45,859
Your captain and your second-in-command.

851
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:47,809
And I'm your boss.

852
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,370
Marisha,

853
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,461
...why don't they touch you?

854
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:55,721
Don't you understand?! They like me.

855
01:09:56,501 --> 01:10:00,762
Marisha, I beg you, put them in cages.

856
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:04,333
Odessa on the horizon! Let the XO ask.

857
01:10:04,883 --> 01:10:08,344
Oleg Petrovich, for God's sake, please ask you.

858
01:10:10,345 --> 01:10:11,604
Comrade barmaid!

859
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,266
Comrade barmaid,

860
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:23,167
...put the animals in cages immediately.

861
01:10:23,747 --> 01:10:26,337
And when they ask, they say please.

862
01:10:27,398 --> 01:10:29,348
For me, for me, please.

863
01:10:30,629 --> 01:10:33,670
Please, drive the animals into the cages.

864
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:36,450
Come on, let's go home! Forward march to the cages!

865
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:40,021
Oh, that's it, huh?! Like this?! Don't you obey?! Let's go to the cages!

866
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:43,392
Here you go! Here you go!

867
01:10:44,362 --> 01:10:49,072
Ooh, ginger team! What, snapping? Snapping? Let's go!

868
01:10:49,293 --> 01:10:52,113
- Marin, stop! - Well Vas!

869
01:10:52,664 --> 01:10:55,564
Here, here. Well, eat. Here! Well, well!

870
01:10:57,124 --> 01:10:58,464
Look out!

871
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:02,666
Ow! Aaaaah!

872
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:07,207
Drown!!! Drowning!

873
01:11:07,207 --> 01:11:09,607
Guys, come here!

874
01:11:10,997 --> 01:11:12,758
Drowning!

875
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:17,489
- Thank you. - Man overboard!

876
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:22,810
Hand over the left anchor!

877
01:11:34,932 --> 01:11:37,553
What accuracy!

878
01:11:52,596 --> 01:11:53,677
Just a second.

879
01:11:58,137 --> 01:12:00,648
- They're swimming beautifully! - Who?

880
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:04,629
That group over there in the striped swimsuits.

881
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:58,290
Sergunchik, follow me!

882
01:13:09,212 --> 01:13:12,083
Crazy, where?!

883
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:15,364
Where are you going, big guy? Off the roof!

884
01:13:15,534 --> 01:13:19,354
It's not our car! Get off! I said get off!

885
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,165
What are you looking at?!

886
01:13:31,778 --> 01:13:33,388
Mommy,

887
01:13:34,758 --> 01:13:38,389
...I always dream of you in some exotic form.

888
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:45,820
What shall I do?

889
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,021
Come here! Come here! Come on!

890
01:13:50,582 --> 01:13:55,022
Come on! Come on, let's go! Guys, let's go. That's my boy!

891
01:13:55,202 --> 01:13:58,493
To the steamer, to the steamer. It's time for dinner. Come on, let's go.

892
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:00,584
Let's go.

893
01:14:01,644 --> 01:14:03,505
Pussy!

894
01:14:14,677 --> 01:14:16,437
The last ones are floating.

895
01:14:17,467 --> 01:14:21,058
- Look, look! Marishka is holding on to her tail. - Quiet!

896
01:14:21,058 --> 01:14:24,379
- She's not by the tail at all, she's swimming on her own. - No, by the tail, by the tail!

897
01:14:24,379 --> 01:14:28,809
Fifth, sixth, seventh.

898
01:14:28,809 --> 01:14:33,961
Get away from the board! Bring the last cage to the corridor exit!

899
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:38,301
Quickly! Sidorenko, get ready!

900
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:42,593
Behind the last animal, slam the door at once!

901
01:14:44,182 --> 01:14:46,303
Lock it in the cage!

902
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:50,504
Roll it back to its place!

903
01:14:50,504 --> 01:14:54,405
Ah, uncle! I came in handy! You did?

904
01:14:54,405 --> 01:14:58,506
- Bring up the left anchor! - What's wrong with you, Marianne?!

905
01:14:58,506 --> 01:15:01,016
Oleg Petrovich, please, to the infirmary her.

906
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:11,268
Raise the left anchor!

907
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:23,101
One. Two. Three. Four.

908
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:26,892
- Five. - I'm sorry, you counted me out.

909
01:15:26,892 --> 01:15:30,762
And I'll have you all the way down to the pier, you crook.

910
01:15:30,762 --> 01:15:34,584
What, are you gonna turn him in for a lion? There was a lion in that cage.

911
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:37,504
The lion is in the tamer's cabin!

912
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:39,044
Open up!

913
01:15:40,215 --> 01:15:43,385
- You go now! Courage! - Don't shove it!

914
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:47,957
- Come on! - Open up!

915
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:00,579
- Come on, come on! - He's asleep.

916
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:02,970
Yeah. Let's go in, and he's...

917
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,870
- He's drunk on Luminal. He's gone crazy, poor guy. - Be quiet!

918
01:16:07,231 --> 01:16:09,441
You'll wake us up.

919
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:23,844
- Tie him up, tie him up! - Quiet! Quiet!

920
01:16:38,267 --> 01:16:39,887
Take it easy! Take it easy!

921
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:44,098
He's faking it, the bastard! He's waiting for us to get closer.

922
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:55,770
- Quiet. - Come on. - Valya, try to tie him like a muzzle.

923
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:59,392
- Try it yourself. - Look, he's listening! - Quiet!

924
01:16:59,692 --> 01:17:01,892
Don't breathe on him. He can smell it.

925
01:17:02,622 --> 01:17:07,473
- Oh, comrades! Guys, we need to change the shoulder. - Quiet! Be patient.

926
01:17:07,803 --> 01:17:08,723
Shhh!...

927
01:17:10,114 --> 01:17:13,045
- Hush! - Shh!...

928
01:17:13,435 --> 01:17:14,935
Shh!...

929
01:17:18,586 --> 01:17:20,647
Drop the gun! Be a man!

930
01:17:32,658 --> 01:17:35,019
Uh-oh!

931
01:17:35,389 --> 01:17:40,791
Uh-oh! Uh-oh-oh-oh!

932
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:43,711
Freeze. Where are you going?

933
01:17:51,073 --> 01:17:52,573
Stand up!

934
01:17:59,064 --> 01:18:01,325
- Quiet! It's occupied! - Quiet, you!

935
01:18:01,325 --> 01:18:03,075
It's occupied, it's occupied!

936
01:18:08,757 --> 01:18:10,687
Comrade sailors, what are you doing?!

937
01:18:11,047 --> 01:18:15,978
- What about me?! - Come out already, tamer. - Well, brother, aren't you mad?

938
01:18:18,648 --> 01:18:20,459
You won't bite?

939
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,821
- Courage! - Calm down. - Courage! - Steady.

940
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:32,581
- Don't step on the udder, it'll wake up. - Steady.

941
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:42,414
Oh, I'm glad you're feeling better.

942
01:18:42,554 --> 01:18:46,485
Maybe you're able to go by yourself now, huh?

943
01:18:53,866 --> 01:18:56,677
And no one asked you to drag me all over the ship!

944
01:19:01,387 --> 01:19:04,568
- Goodbye, Comrade Captain. - Have a good voyage.

945
01:19:04,568 --> 01:19:06,739
- Don't forget! - Happy sailing, friends.

946
01:19:08,189 --> 01:19:09,360
Goodbye.

947
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,472
- Goodbye. - Goodbye, Comrade Captain.

948
01:19:27,744 --> 01:19:29,694
So, are you sad to break up?

949
01:19:35,044 --> 01:19:39,756
It's not hard for you, is it? Then let's go. Just don't lose your pants.

950
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,519
Yes!..

951
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:01,620
And then she sat by the cages and sobbed.

952
01:20:03,151 --> 01:20:04,961
And the whole crew ,

953
01:20:05,491 --> 01:20:10,172
...even the tigers, had tears in their eyes...

954
01:20:11,653 --> 01:20:14,243
...tears like that.

955
01:20:15,103 --> 01:20:17,254
Believe it or not.

956
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,795
What a sad story!

957
01:20:21,764 --> 01:20:26,696
So Marianne became a tiger tamer, huh?

958
01:20:26,696 --> 01:20:29,877
No, she didn't become a tamer.

959
01:20:30,236 --> 01:20:32,577
And yet she found her calling.

960
01:20:33,357 --> 01:20:36,868
Didn't that kind of love ever end?

961
01:20:37,258 --> 01:20:40,209
I would have found it, I would have certainly found it.

962
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,340
Let's go.

963
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:57,422
Over there, look. See?

964
01:20:57,422 --> 01:21:00,823
Excuse me, Marianna Andreyevna, you're wanted backstage.

965
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:04,083
- The artist is ill. Please. - All right.

966
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:12,605
Go home, wash the dishes, make dinner and wait for me.

967
01:21:14,116 --> 01:21:15,616
Are you coming soon?

968
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:18,346
Get a doctor, quick!

969
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:26,348
Hurry, hurry. Doctor.

970
01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:30,580
- Let the doctor through. Don't crowd, comrades. - Listen, how did he get out?

971
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:33,280
- They say he bit off the lock. - What lock?

972
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,761
- What happened. - Marianna Andreevna, Vaska tore Achilles.

973
01:21:44,902 --> 01:21:49,083
Well, sick man, what are we complaining about? You won't fight another time.

974
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:51,394
Why did you bite off Vasya's tail, huh?

975
01:21:57,575 --> 01:21:59,355
You got one too.

976
01:21:59,775 --> 01:22:01,696
I'm bound to become something, too.

977
01:22:02,586 --> 01:22:06,697
I'm going to go to technical school in the fall. Honestly, I will.

978
01:22:08,107 --> 01:22:12,068
The patient needs surgery under clinical conditions. The collar!

979
01:22:53,047 --> 01:22:56,587
Did you see that? I told you the whole truth.

980
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:02,989
Believe it or not.

981
01:23:04,249 --> 01:23:05,109
Here it is.

982
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:12,942
The role of Marianne was played by the tiger tamer...

983
01:23:12,942 --> 01:23:15,192
...Margarita Nazarova.

984
01:23:18,703 --> 01:23:23,884
Directed by tamer Konstantin Konstantinovsky.
