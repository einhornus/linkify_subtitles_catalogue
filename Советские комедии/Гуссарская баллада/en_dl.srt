1
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,680
Alone again! On horseback again!

2
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,960
Though I don't think it's a sin to love to ride.

3
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,680
But I say, for example, it's time you had some restraint.

4
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,320
You're seventeen years old now!

5
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,120
But still not 117!

6
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
Oh, uncle, don't lecture me!

7
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,080
How will you dress, Shurochka?

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,640
- You've decided to shine, haven't you? - It's no secret.

9
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,720
- I don't know, somehow... It's time to decide.

10
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,720
I'll still have time. The guests will not soon be in attendance.

11
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,320
The whole neighborhood is talking about the ball.

12
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,960
Ah, I have an idea!

13
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll put on a costume to show you a fancy dress...

14
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
Hee-hee, you little brat!

15
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,200
Three thousand devils!

16
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,080
My dear!

17
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,040
Report that Brigadier Rzhevsky's nephew...

18
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,400
He has the honor to be with the Major's letter.

19
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,440
Well!!! Well, go on, why are you looking at me like a carrot?

20
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,640
I have an honor - Lieutenant Rzhevsky!

21
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Are you a cornet?

22
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:51,680
- Ah... Mmm... Your uniform is Pavlogradsky, of course!

23
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,600
- No!... I mean, yes! - What a surprise!

24
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,760
Please accept my brotherly salute to the cornet!

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,880
A hussar is a hussar's friend! Isn't it always true?

26
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,200
However, what brings you here?

27
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Mmmm... Perhaps, by the will of providence, you're related to your masters?

28
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,720
- I... yes... - So much the better!

29
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
You will tell the truth about them now, without delay!

30
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:13,159
- I am ready to serve! - Well, in short, here...

31
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,589
The maiden Alexandra lives here, Like a certain Russian rose.

32
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,040
Ah, Shurochka! And she's my... cousin!

33
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,040
So fry everything you know about her.

34
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,200
It's very important to me! Since my childhood days, I am, so to speak...

35
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:27,910
I'm engaged to her in absentia. Have you heard, perhaps? If she's her cousin?

36
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:30,160
That's right, I've heard of the affair.

37
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,840
- Is that you, then? - Alas, my friend.

38
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,794
- Why "alas"? - You're pontificating, of course.

39
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:40,182
- Mmm.... I mean, yes! - You'll understand me then!

40
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm a gambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a gambler.

41
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,920
But my uncle, an old fart, helped me out, On the condition...

42
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,197
...that I should marry now.

43
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,705
I gave my word without looking, I was desperate...

44
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,539
Or maybe I was drunk and out of my mind.

45
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:53,695
But now, alas, there's my reckoning.

46
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,791
- I sympathize with you. - But is she rich?

47
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:58,839
- Tell me? - Not at all.

48
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:02,440
But I don't care if I sink in the sand or in the rocks.

49
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
- And if, for instance... What say you, cornet?

50
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,760
If your cousin does not like you, Lieutenant?

51
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,880
You are a green cornet. Hussars are not green...

52
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,800
They know not the word "no" in love.

53
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,080
And if I dare enter the gates of hell...

54
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,200
Any woman would be glad to be my friend.

55
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,762
But I want to know what she is, your cousin. Is she not pretty?

56
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,454
- Oh, no! - Pretty?

57
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:27,745
- I know not what to say. - Not so, not so. That's what I expected.

58
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:30,302
She's what they call in the world, a prude...

59
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,584
The word "ideal" never leaves her lips.

60
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:36,714
She's fidgety and bawdy and silly, But she can grind rye with her tongue.

61
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:40,827
- You, however, judge very wickedly. - Cornet, I am older than you.

62
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:42,495
I know women better.

63
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:44,843
You must have had too much luck with them.

64
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:48,108
If I had wanted, I would have had occasion to marry a hundred times...

65
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,317
But I've kept my freedom!

66
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:53,164
- Are you as careful in battle? - CORNET!!!

67
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,574
I did not mean to offend you, Lieutenant. Forgive me...

68
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,784
Tell me, tell me in honor...

69
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:03,553
Have you no amorous business with my wife?

70
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,471
- I hope... I swear, Lieutenant, I have not yet shaved...

71
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:11,060
Where shall I go to steal the hearts of fair fairies?

72
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:15,409
- You moustachioed love-mongers have your hands full! - From now on I'll bail you out!

73
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,942
- I'm very glad to meet you. - And I am a cornet. A hussar is a brother to a hussar!

74
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,265
Lieutenant Rzhevsky.

75
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:35,419
Here you are, at last, my light.

76
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:41,584
- Have you seen your niece? - No, I haven't.

77
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:09,912
I haven't seen you in a long time.

78
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,681
Yes, there's a ball in our house.

79
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:15,874
The bride is on her seventeenth birthday.

80
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:22,675
You are asked to order in the kitchen For the sauce - what kind of broth?

81
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,258
- Lieutenant Rzhevsky. - That's him.

82
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:47,215
- I'm glad. - I'm happy... very me...

83
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:51,385
In my own way, forgive me. Keep each other busy.

84
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:05,588
Are you now coming to us from St. Petersburg or Moscow?

85
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:08,237
My voyage is from Moscow.

86
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:11,366
How do you like our quiet city?

87
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,852
You live in it, that's enough to make you like it.

88
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,927
You are too kind.

89
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,408
Hussars are used to speak plainly.

90
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,573
What book do you like?

91
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:25,607
For example, Quarissa.

92
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,680
The other novels are no match, are they?

93
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:33,272
How? I'm sorry, I haven't read it.

94
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:36,379
Will you be with us long?

95
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,734
I've got a month's leave from the regiment.

96
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,202
Yes, a month is running out.

97
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:49,111
What kind of silks would you prefer for this drawing?

98
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:52,916
Renge and Bordeaux are in fashion these days.

99
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:58,122
I dare not advise you. Blue is the prettier of the two.

100
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:04,247
Not you! Not you! Blue is out of tune, Bordeaux here, and gray thereafter.

101
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:06,727
- Well, as you like. - Thank you.

102
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:09,907
Would you like me to give you a pillow? When it's ready.

103
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:12,985
No, I'm not worthy of such a favor.

104
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,013
I embroidered it with my own hand. Although, alas, it's not a new one.

105
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,612
Let me ask you another question.

106
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,316
- Do you like to cry? - Do I? Ha!

107
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,834
There's nothing in the world sweeter than pure tears.

108
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:37,572
- Have you read Werther? - No. I haven't read that one either.

109
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:42,383
- You must read it, Charmaine. - Where is your uncle?

110
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:46,368
Perhaps you have dreamed with the subject of your heart...

111
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,231
...to sit by the sad moon?

112
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,509
And shed tears in perfect sorrow?

113
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:55,387
If you have dreamed, I'll tell you a secret.

114
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:59,682
Sir, the gentleman asks you to his office.

115
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:36,106
Count Nourin!

116
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:41,103
Count, we weren't expecting you at all, Such a surprise at our ball.

117
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:43,740
Such an honor. You know each other?

118
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:46,048
My niece.

119
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:51,781
О! Alas. You must have been a child when I left your land.

120
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:53,745
I wouldn't be surprised if you'd forgotten.

121
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:57,210
- Well, what of Paris? - Oh, it's paradise

122
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,603
Tell me, is it true that this autumn the French will be at war with us?

123
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:06,768
Cédreux... There will be no war at all! I think, though I am no coward...

124
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:12,896
We can't compete with Europe. Is it possible?! La France and us?

125
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:16,520
No, the best minds in the world would not advise us to fight.

126
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,173
I left you the last cotillion.

127
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:48,530
I'm happy!

128
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:52,727
Between the figures let's end our conversation about perfect tears.

129
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,336
I wish I could persuade you, if you don't agree.

130
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:00,323
There's half a chapter like that in Wurtar...!

131
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:01,627
- Ah... - Mm-mm!!!

132
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,909
Oh, Shurochka, sing us a verse, What the Lieutenant sang last time.

133
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:15,679
- At the governor's. - Now?

134
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:17,450
- Oh, yes. - That's what we're all asking.

135
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:31,662
/Singing/: Young Pretty Woman, I bid you farewell.

136
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:35,375
Let a bullet of good fortune cut my way on earth.

137
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:39,248
If I should fall, in unequal battle...

138
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:43,457
...but, Armida, remember, remember my short life.

139
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,798
In the bloody saddle my horse bears me.

140
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:51,774
To the tender green maples From a strange fire.

141
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:55,701
"My hussar's tunic is on fire, Opened from the shoulder...

142
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,671
...In crimson yellow light, the light of the last ray.

143
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:04,593
The sunset with its invisible hand Blesses me.

144
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,979
And the memorial willow tree rustles softly...

145
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:12,849
...There is no higher place in the world To dream, to love and to sing.

146
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:17,144
And in my native land, in my native land, to fight and die.

147
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:21,410
- Lovely! - Cut. Sharman.

148
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,750
You should be an actor, Shura.

149
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,580
Their whole life is an affair.

150
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:28,060
No, it's not my nature.

151
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,309
I'll be back in my masquerade costume.

152
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:33,322
Mazurka. Madame Angéozhe!

153
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,587
Well, finally, cornet, where have you disappeared to?

154
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,984
I've been looking for you everywhere. It's so boring here.

155
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:04,325
I'm at your service, sir, all the way. But is it possible to be bored at a ball?

156
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,898
I'll have to reproach my cousin, for she's kept you badly occupied.

157
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:12,220
I have taken much from her. I'll never forget this day.

158
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,383
By the way, you spoke to her, didn't you?

159
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,353
- Who? - My cousin, damn it.

160
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:18,694
When I think of her, I feel sick in the back of my head.

161
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,134
Yeah! You played the snake, didn't you?

162
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:24,198
...and I got all her impressions of the groom candidate.

163
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,617
И? She's in love with him, isn't she?

164
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:29,374
She's all "ha-ha" and "hee-hee" and "hee-hee-hee.

165
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,697
No, she didn't like you terribly.

166
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:34,649
What do you mean, she didn't like you?

167
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,542
She said you complimented her in vain.

168
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,931
I did?

169
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:42,503
She said she had never met a cheekier man.

170
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:46,513
I beg your pardon, you've got a moustache hanging like a bastard...

171
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:50,242
What?! You're as bold as she is! I am!... I am!!!

172
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:52,663
That from manners one can see the habit of horses.

173
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:56,308
I will not give one mare for a hundred such maidens!!!

174
00:14:56,618 --> 00:15:01,900
That of all the familiar faces she hath not seen, pardon me, a nastier snout.

175
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:05,803
Aye? A thousand devils! Maybe it's for the best.

176
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,322
If you don't like him, you can't marry him.

177
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,879
Not a bit. She also said...

178
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,408
...that it is no longer for her to change my uncle's will.

179
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:16,158
That if he commanded it, she would go for the beast.

180
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:17,728
That she can even train bears.

181
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,325
Enough! I trust you now as a brother.

182
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,953
You are my first friend among all men.

183
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,591
Well, you're a wiggler! Fool! Sour girl.

184
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,171
So, you've decided not to get married?

185
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:29,607
I wish I could. But I gave my word to my uncle.

186
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:31,917
I owe him a debt. And with this I pay my debt.

187
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,386
Don't be discouraged at the masquerade! Come, let us dance.

188
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,454
No. I will have a drink with you on the brotherhood.

189
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:39,051
There's a lovely cliquot here.

190
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:41,639
Your offer is too flattering.

191
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:44,609
- But we are of different ranks. - For pity's sake, what nonsense!

192
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,563
Know that wherever a hussar's spurs ring, there's equality.

193
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:17,301
Attention, gentlemen, I ask for everyone's attention.

194
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,815
Trouble has come upon our homeland.

195
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,740
A storm of war has covered our skies.

196
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:27,313
On the thirteenth day, Bonaparte's armies have crossed the Neman.

197
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:30,425
The moment of trial is at hand.

198
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:33,324
I hope all of you will faithfully do your duty.

199
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:36,508
All officers, please return to the regiment.

200
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,407
Very well!

201
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:40,629
We'll meet the hour with dignity.

202
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:42,894
I beg you, ball, now I'll stop.

203
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:45,863
- Forgive me, my friend. - Ah, your lordship, what are you.

204
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:50,039
You're ready to die for your country. There's no happier part under the moon...

205
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,420
Than to die for my country! Isn't that so, Cornet?

206
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:07,388
- I'll take my leave. - I know it's not my destiny.

207
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,370
Write, my friend.

208
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,726
With you, cornet, we'll find each other.

209
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:20,370
If we shall not be killed in the war, When our victories shine...

210
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,163
Will you not bid farewell to your cousin? Shall I call?

211
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,645
I will not. I am not worthy of this maiden.

212
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:30,041
Tell her I bow. Let me kiss thee, in love.

213
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:06,170
Ah, Shurochka.

214
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,414
Pardon me, the costume is excellent, bravo. And in the spirit of the day.

215
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:12,885
Lovely, isn't it?

216
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,849
We've been talking amongst ourselves, How we can help the troops.

217
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:18,785
We've decided to make a corpse out of rags...

218
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,712
- For the infirmary. - Tomorrow at five.

219
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:57,940
*What did he say? ♪ There's no greater battle for my country under the moon ♪

220
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,935
*♪ If it were up to me, I'd want to die ♪

221
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:07,889
To die in battle. On a war horse, flying like the wind.

222
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:18,583
Oh, young lady, what wonders in the world, a hussar. And the posture's perfect.

223
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:25,894
I wish you had a horse. And a foam on your muzzle. And a sabre, and you'd be on parade.

224
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:33,459
I'd be glad to serve as such a young man again, though I've served much.

225
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,669
Go to bed. They've all gone from the ball.

226
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:50,142
Tell me, would you serve with me again, if I were a man?

227
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:59,488
I begged the master to let me go, if I had reason to be choked, that the enemy was coming to my country.

228
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:04,188
I'd like to be in battle once more. To shed blood for my people.

229
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,466
Take me with you! I do not laugh!

230
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,542
A hussar before you! I know how to shoot, you taught me!

231
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:14,571
You just said I should have a horse. I've made up my mind, there's no more way for me!

232
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:19,401
Are you jesting with an old man? I'll tell the lord to look after you.

233
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:23,817
You can't stop me with words. If you forbid me, I'll run away all the same.

234
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,801
There's only one thing on Russians' minds now: How to save my homeland.

235
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:29,215
And I'm here with needlework and dolls.

236
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:32,997
No, I want to try what I'm worth. And in battle!

237
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:37,927
And if I'm killed, blame yourself for my death. I didn't want to be my orderly.

238
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:42,001
To fight with me in the war! Well, farewell!

239
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:46,054
You'll be recognized!

240
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:51,109
Fear not, old man, no one will know. So I must go away alone?

241
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,664
God owns the brave. What about my uncle?

242
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,897
He'll go mad if he doesn't find you at the manor in the morning.

243
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,438
A maiden to the camp. And he's all about the wedding.

244
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,303
I'll write to him from the road.

245
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,634
Well, what are you sitting there?

246
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:10,325
Tell him to lock the doors. I'll go out the window.

247
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:17,741
Forgive me, according to the Christian faith, If I am foolishly guilty.

248
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,960
I'm ready to serve as a Suvorov soldier.

249
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,801
We'll leave now. I'll wait here for you.

250
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:32,476
- Saddle your horse. - I'll not deceive you.

251
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:44,993
# Farewell to my old home, perhaps forever #

252
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:49,433
*♪ Here my years flowed without a care ♪

253
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:55,072
*♪ Here I grew up and played and played and played ♪

254
00:21:56,503 --> 00:22:00,628
*Was a child. ♪ I'm a grown-up now ♪

255
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:07,530
*♪ Say good-bye to my dear, kind, old home ♪

256
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:46,169
/ Sings a lyrical song:/ Moonlit meadows, The night is as bright as day.

257
00:22:48,421 --> 00:23:01,077
Sleep, my Svetlana, Sleep as I slept.

258
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:16,249
# In the corner of the pillow, tuck your nose in... #

259
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:30,598
The stars, like freckles, Shine down peacefully.

260
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:45,574
The moonlit garden rustles quietly in its leaves.

261
00:23:47,918 --> 00:24:00,215
The day is coming, What does it promise?

262
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:14,592
The candle burns out, It burns to the ground.

263
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:30,949
Sleep, my heart, Sleep as I slept.

264
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:55,745
I hear the noise of battle.

265
00:24:56,257 --> 00:25:00,669
Yes, the army is near. What do you say? Where are you from and who are you?

266
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:03,892
I'll say I'm behind the regiment. That I want to fight

267
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:06,484
I want to fight again. No one will reproach me for lying.

268
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,986
Oh, young lady. Do you see there in the rye?

269
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:21,160
What's the matter with you, Captain?

270
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:26,706
I have a bullet in my chest.

271
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:30,462
I have with me a packet of the most important report.

272
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:35,943
Cornet, I beseech you to finish the task given me by the field-marshal.

273
00:25:36,757 --> 00:25:43,692
and set forth at once. Across the river, our rearguard is fighting Murat.

274
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:45,796
I'll prove myself trustworthy.

275
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,566
Come, cornet. Ride, God be with you.

276
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:54,615
He is badly wounded. Stay with him, Ivan.

277
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,768
But, young lady...

278
00:25:57,768 --> 00:26:00,937
Look. See you, Captain!

279
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,581
A package for you, your lordship, from the field marshal.

280
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:00,468
What, blood? Are you not wounded, Cornet?

281
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:03,289
It is the messenger's blood. He gave me this packet.

282
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:06,042
The packet was on his breast, but the bullet pierced his chest.

283
00:28:06,283 --> 00:28:10,877
My friend, we are, unfortunately, at war. And you are a cornet, a cavalryman of talent.

284
00:28:11,082 --> 00:28:14,552
I would gladly take you on. Will you be my junior adjutant at headquarters?

285
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:15,653
I'm glad.

286
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:22,459
Murat's gone round, he wants to surround us.

287
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:29,405
The field marshal has ordered us to retreat.

288
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:48,564
/There once was Henri the Fourth, He was a glorious king.

289
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:52,668
He loved wine to hell, but he was sober at times.

290
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:57,167
La-la, boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom.

291
00:28:57,417 --> 00:29:01,828
La-la, boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom-boom.

292
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:06,596
He loved war, and he fought like a rooster.

293
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:10,893
And in hand-to-hand combat, he was worth two.

294
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:15,437
La-la, boom-boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom.

295
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:20,085
La-la, boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom-boom.

296
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:25,037
One day an old lady came after him with a stick...

297
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:29,419
...and he struck her in the ear with his knightly hand.

298
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:34,037
La-la, boom-boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom.

299
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:36,003
La-la, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom.

300
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:46,658
But death, full of treachery, has been waiting for him.

301
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:53,207
She stabbed him with her knife from around the corner.

302
00:29:53,607 --> 00:30:00,427
La-la, boom-boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom. La-la, boom-boom.

303
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:07,563
La-la, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom-boom.

304
00:30:08,447 --> 00:30:15,575
"The blood spurted from his veins.

305
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:22,834
And the wicked old man Died as he lived.

306
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,695
La-la, boom-boom-boom.

307
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,591
La-la, boom-boom-boom.

308
00:30:29,902 --> 00:30:38,146
La-la, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom-boom.

309
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:06,788
I came from headquarters with the relay.

310
00:31:07,923 --> 00:31:10,868
Oh, you came? Who do you want?

311
00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:12,031
I'm the adjutant.

312
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:13,734
I can see it in your eyes that you're an adjutant.

313
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:16,334
- Who shall I hand this package to? Vasilyev on reconnaissance.

314
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:19,033
And the assistant? Who can I give this order to?

315
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:22,985
About the assistant, it's easier than that. Lieutenant! To you!

316
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:25,913
And I'll ask you to stand in front of the headquarters!

317
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:27,650
/Great laughter/

318
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:31,528
HQ again? You'd better send some vodka.

319
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:38,813
What a meeting! Is that you? Lieutenant...

320
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:43,184
Where are you from, brother, and what's your fate? I didn't think I'd meet you here.

321
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:46,887
I didn't recognize you at once. But you have come at a good hour.

322
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:47,952
They know each other!

323
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,924
I brought you orders from the corps headquarters.

324
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:54,290
I don't give a damn about orders. Gentlemen! Cornet Azarov! My old friend.

325
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,421
Love and respect to the Hussar!

326
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,501
We are glad to see you!

327
00:31:57,525 --> 00:32:00,061
We're always happy to invite you to our tight bivouac circle.

328
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,349
- The hospitality of the partisans is well known. - Is the porridge ready?

329
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,040
We ask you to share our breakfast with your new friends.

330
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:07,867
By any chance did you bring a bottle with you?

331
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,963
No. I guess you haven't had much experience as an officer.

332
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,294
So, tell me about yourself, Cornet. How are you doing?

333
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,207
Quite happy with my service.

334
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:23,288
Yes, my cousin asked me to say hello if I meet you.

335
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:25,925
Well, I beg your friendship, don't think of her.

336
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:30,434
- Who's that cousin? - I've got Rzhevsky. - Here's your answer.

337
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:33,478
It's embarrassing to think of that meeting.

338
00:32:33,873 --> 00:32:35,661
Hey, you white-haired bastard.

339
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:39,162
- It's nothing, really. - We know those tricks.

340
00:32:39,186 --> 00:32:42,833
All right, I'll tell you! He's the witness.

341
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:48,165
My uncle, the foreman, has decided to marry me.

342
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:54,947
That's the sorriest day I've ever known. The bride, my God... I'm in a cold sweat.

343
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:56,388
Is she so ugly?

344
00:32:56,732 --> 00:33:00,481
It's true to say, I think she's a freak of note.

345
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:05,820
- What are you, cornet? - No, you're not fair! She's pretty!

346
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:11,242
What are you saying? Her nose is like a plum, her eyes are like a plum, her braids are like bunting.

347
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:12,256
What a scarecrow.

348
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:16,766
She's a fool! Isn't she? But she's not ugly! I'll vouch for that.

349
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:21,494
Our tastes are different, then. In your way, but in general it's disgusting.

350
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:26,899
And what's most unpleasant, you may imagine, is that she fell in love with me at once.

351
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:31,198
- What are you cornet? - No, nothing!

352
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:38,363
There was a ball in the evening! She wandered after me like a shadow everywhere. She never took her eyes off me.

353
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:41,235
Admit it, Rzhevsky, you didn't tell us everything.

354
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:45,287
I suppose you kissed her in a ballroom whirl, In some secluded corner...

355
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,243
I, gentlemen, am afraid to be immodest, but I have kissed...

356
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:52,071
- What's the matter, cornet? - Nay, nothing.

357
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:54,516
There's no great sin in it, and I could not rightly

358
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,132
when she was about to tear herself from her dress!

359
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:02,815
Well, good fellow, eh?

360
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:06,244
I hate with a passion the priggish, sour, sour woman.

361
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:08,694
If such a one were in trouble, I'd not lift a hand

362
00:34:08,718 --> 00:34:10,701
I would not lift a hand to avert the danger.

363
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,853
What if my cousin were in trouble? Would you not feel pity for her?

364
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:18,341
- Certainly not! - I'll wager you! I'll wager you!

365
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:20,288
- You! - You! You slander for nothing!

366
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:24,173
I'll wager with you that if the occasion should come...

367
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:27,286
That I'll save a fashionable woman with my own hand, I'll...

368
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,815
You must marry her!

369
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,010
Damn it, that'll never happen!

370
00:34:31,163 --> 00:34:33,038
I'll ask our hands to separate!

371
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:37,768
There's a French wagon train crawling through the woods!

372
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:41,179
Follow me, my friends, we'll treat them to Russian!

373
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:49,454
What's in here? Carpets and piles of silk. Weapons? That's a good one for us, by the way.

374
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:56,057
There's more trophy there. Wow, hussars rejoice, wine!

375
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:57,384
Cheers!

376
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:07,517
Wait! If my eyes do not lie, Germont Louise! Gentlemen, am I dreaming or am I delirious?

377
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,683
- This way, Germont! - From where?

378
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,542
It's very nice, but you're not happy, I see.

379
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,134
I would sooner believe in a bird that suddenly popped out of a brook, ...

380
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,181
Than in this, on the road, here, the goddess of dreams, the dream of fairies. And this is a dream.

381
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:23,808
Flattery is nice to me. That's me.

382
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,011
Quick, where's Lymov?! Come here! I know you, don't I?

383
00:37:28,906 --> 00:37:32,267
I was a slave to your beauty, wasn't I, last fall.

384
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:41,325
But tell me more clearly, where are you from? At least the gist of it.

385
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:45,089
You're spinning on pins and needles, Lieutenant. Let me breathe.

386
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:48,269
But we will not let the French have you now. Won't we, brothers?

387
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:51,165
My God. From now on, I have no desire to return to them myself.

388
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:54,182
Hurrah for Germont! Hurray for Germont!

389
00:37:57,176 --> 00:38:03,905
/ Singing:/ When the punch of purple flames All around again, all around again illuminated.

390
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:07,270
The chorus of the beloved shall be sung again.

391
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:12,078
A long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago!

392
00:38:12,644 --> 00:38:19,276
We're all a little superstitious, But we believe hard, we believe only in wine.

393
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,851
In it we drown all our chimeras.

394
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:27,680
A long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago!

395
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:35,087
The glory of the smoke hangs over us, And only, only one thing torments us.

396
00:38:35,806 --> 00:38:39,048
Hearts without practice rust.

397
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:43,971
A long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago!

398
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:48,334
In battles, not in bed, To part

399
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:51,252
with life, we are destined to part.

400
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:56,427
The popes must have been singing us off.

401
00:38:56,451 --> 00:39:02,987
A long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago!

402
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,679
For the Motherland, Mother Russia!

403
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:10,011
I, gentlemen, want to say, In many countries I have played,...

404
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:14,065
But it's only here with you that I cherish my success. I love you all!

405
00:39:14,428 --> 00:39:16,207
Russia has become dear to me, too.

406
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:20,096
- Yay, Germont! - Now it's your turn to sing.

407
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:21,270
- Please! - Yes.

408
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:23,921
No, you're right, gentlemen. I have forgotten everything.

409
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:26,622
Your memory has always been bad.

410
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:29,559
Oh no. I remembered one verse.

411
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:34,287
But don't judge too harshly - War, excitement, the road.

412
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:49,076
/ Sings: / Call me, my beloved. Forget all that was, my beloved.

413
00:39:49,539 --> 00:40:00,736
Let's forget what happened, my beloved. There is no power more miraculous than the power of love.

414
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:10,833
Let the wine splash, I drink, it's not enough for me. I drink, I'm not enough, I'm drunk.

415
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:17,119
I drink, all I can't get enough, I'm already drunk. And the hall is spinning, I drink all I can't get enough.

416
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:30,935
I'm not drinking enough, I'm already drunk, And the hall is spinning, I don't care anymore!

417
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:43,188
And if it's the end, I won't cry. I'll tell you without deceit, I won't cry.

418
00:40:43,502 --> 00:40:53,496
I'll tell you without deceit, I won't cry. There's a bottom to the cup, and in the muzzle is lead!

419
00:40:56,598 --> 00:41:05,174
I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drunk.

420
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:11,364
I drink all I can't get enough, I'm already drunk, And the hall is spinning, I drink all I can't get enough.

421
00:41:11,697 --> 00:41:26,006
I'm not drinking enough, I'm already drunk, And the hall is spinning, I don't care anymore!

422
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:30,727
- Bravo! Bravo! - You are worthy to be a goddess!

423
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,925
Don't lose your head, brother.

424
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:35,359
And I have no pity for you, Louise, All is nothing before you!

425
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:37,877
The fortune teller is destined to love the brown-haired girl.

426
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:40,755
- You what? - No, nothing! Sit down, Cornet.

427
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:45,632
Lymov, I'll tell you a secret, If you're a faithful friend.

428
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:47,164
I love you more and more every hour.

429
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:53,819
I don't like actresses! First of all. And secondly... I forgot. Pour it!

430
00:41:58,455 --> 00:42:03,793
Fortune-tellers always lie! For you, Lieutenant, I speak now!

431
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:04,851
He's very nice.

432
00:42:05,141 --> 00:42:07,247
He's just a boy. No, give me your elbow.

433
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:10,186
- It's too much. - You're not jealous?

434
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:11,877
Oh, not at all.

435
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:17,811
I've never drunk so much in my life I swear on my life, my life...

436
00:42:18,027 --> 00:42:22,115
...Was... Yes, I was! I'll sing!

437
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:26,684
- You? Yes, now! Please be quiet!

438
00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:29,093
- We ask! - Just don't fake it.

439
00:42:29,161 --> 00:42:34,043
- He's so full of youth. - Mademoiselle, I was listening to you.

440
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:48,442
/ Singing in a drunken voice:/ They call me a youth without youth. I don't care, I don't care, I don't care!

441
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:51,769
At least they don't call me a coward!

442
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:56,591
A long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago!

443
00:42:57,762 --> 00:43:04,014
Otherwise he twirls his whiskers furiously, Bottles to all, bottles to all, looks at the bottom of them all.

444
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:07,523
But he himself is only a copy of the Hussar.

445
00:43:07,547 --> 00:43:12,093
A long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago!

446
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:19,384
And some swear by passion, But when the wine has been drunk, when the wine has been drunk...

447
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:24,193
...All his passion is at the bottom of the bottle.

448
00:43:24,217 --> 00:43:29,236
A long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago!

449
00:43:30,084 --> 00:43:36,411
The sea is knee-deep in lovers. I am with them in this, with them in this.

450
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:40,515
But treason is waiting for everyone.

451
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:46,731
A long time ago, a long time ago, a long time ago!

452
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,489
- What's wrong with him? - It's not good.

453
00:43:49,822 --> 00:43:51,457
- Azarov! - Water!

454
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:54,501
We old hobos don't care about this feast now, do we?

455
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:55,511
Now, unbutton that uniform.

456
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,107
No, no!!! Я.. I'm a little hot.

457
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:02,131
I don't like women, though.

458
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:08,213
I don't like women, though.

459
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:12,718
How your eyes shine brightly.

460
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:14,304
- Lieutenant! - Just a kiss, please.

461
00:44:14,457 --> 00:44:15,260
No, no.

462
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:19,788
Deserve what? Idea! I'll be right back.

463
00:44:27,872 --> 00:44:31,641
Pierre. Do you really not even want to say a word to me?

464
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:32,791
Believe me...

465
00:44:32,815 --> 00:44:34,729
There's no need to go on, everything is clear without words.

466
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,213
My friend, do you want the truth?

467
00:44:36,419 --> 00:44:40,046
No, I'm not playing this game anymore, I don't want truth or lies.

468
00:44:40,254 --> 00:44:41,426
But, Pierre, please.

469
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:44,408
I ask you as much, in my life do not confuse me.

470
00:44:44,646 --> 00:44:47,808
- You will be sorry. - Maybe. But even then I won't change.

471
00:44:48,142 --> 00:44:52,777
- Pierre, I have been faithful to you, I swear. - Let's keep our vows, too.

472
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:59,187
- Here's my surprise! - Flowers? Where did you get them?

473
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:04,182
In the midst of winter such a miracle? Lieutenant! I promised you nothing.

474
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,337
Have mercy!

475
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,230
I want to give the flowers to the one who is the dearest of you all.

476
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,165
- It's a custom in Provence. - My flowers? But why?

477
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,871
And she will give it to Lymov.

478
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:20,840
Pour me some more wine. Cornet, I drink a glass to you!

479
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:23,754
Give me the flower now. Give it to me now!

480
00:45:23,884 --> 00:45:26,175
At least you'll concede. A hop hit him in the head.

481
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:29,755
- He is devilishly hot in resentment. - Thank you, mademoiselle!

482
00:45:30,582 --> 00:45:37,812
All right! Please come to the barrier. I challenge you! Yes, yes!

483
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:43,640
Are you silent? The rank of officer, you coward, is not worthy then.

484
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:49,375
I ask to be my second. Pierre Lymov, you as well as you!

485
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,536
But he is on duty as an adjutant to leave us tomorrow.

486
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:53,119
Immediately we will fight!

487
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:54,426
- But where? - Over there!

488
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:57,127
- However, brothers, how is it possible? - Here, now, a duel?

489
00:45:57,386 --> 00:45:59,012
- Please... No, mademoiselle!

490
00:45:59,196 --> 00:46:00,112
To the barrier!

491
00:46:00,136 --> 00:46:02,957
God... Atonement, I will kiss you myself.

492
00:46:04,648 --> 00:46:12,722
Shit... I'm losing my mind. I am willing to forgive the insult.

493
00:46:12,863 --> 00:46:15,655
But I don't need your condescension!

494
00:46:15,914 --> 00:46:18,634
- What a mess. - Told you I was sorry.

495
00:46:18,724 --> 00:46:23,541
No! If you're not willing to shoot You must ask my forgiveness!

496
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:27,627
In Russia there will never be this compote, That I ask for forgiveness!

497
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:31,053
Yes! Shoot here and now!

498
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,182
Another warning. Will you friends make peace after all?

499
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:49,159
- Oh, you shouldn't have. - I have been insulted here.

500
00:47:00,096 --> 00:47:04,126
Get together! I count. One.

501
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,619
Two.

502
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,495
Three.

503
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:18,312
- Davyd! - Colonel!

504
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:22,629
- What's going on here? - A duel with this dandy.

505
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:27,071
How dare you, in time of military action? In the hour of our fatherland's distress.

506
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,730
Is not occasion enough for another firing? Stand down!

507
00:47:31,157 --> 00:47:35,831
If I hear again of this scandalous cause, I'll punish you with a fitting punishment.

508
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:40,032
I'll punish him without regard to valor or rank. Where did this cornet come from?

509
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:42,207
I have brought you a packet from corps headquarters.

510
00:47:42,899 --> 00:47:46,697
You, cornet, have you no other amusement here than to duel?

511
00:47:48,718 --> 00:47:52,431
Bah. What do I see? Are you, mademoiselle? Where did you come from?

512
00:47:52,455 --> 00:47:55,671
Where the devil did you come from? Am I dreaming?

513
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,473
- No, it's me. - It's the wonder of wonders!

514
00:47:58,844 --> 00:48:01,851
Sheherazade in the midst of my hangers-on.

515
00:48:06,895 --> 00:48:10,601
Friends, the field marshal thanks us!

516
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:11,787
- Himself? - Yes!

517
00:48:12,513 --> 00:48:15,380
- Here's the signature, "N. Kutuzov"! -Oh, really?

518
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:16,470
Let me see!

519
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:20,694
If we all beat the French like you, the enemy would be defeated!

520
00:48:21,217 --> 00:48:24,238
It's the partisans' habit to fight without fear of death.

521
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:29,622
- We beat our enemies wherever we meet them! - Long time ago, long time ago!

522
00:48:30,061 --> 00:48:35,686
Colonel! I beg you. Can't you find a place in the detachment for a cornet?

523
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,363
- I mean, for you? - Yes.

524
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:41,078
No, my friend, alas. A cornet in a detachment is a bad omen.

525
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,017
Thank you, my brave savior.

526
00:51:51,764 --> 00:51:53,871
Accept my heartfelt gratitude.

527
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,104
But how did you do it?

528
00:51:57,128 --> 00:52:00,850
It all worked out, didn't it? Here at headquarters, you'll find everything you need.

529
00:52:01,404 --> 00:52:03,946
I must go. Excuse me, service.

530
00:52:04,048 --> 00:52:06,331
I'm the adjutant of the sovereign, Count Bolmashov.

531
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:10,854
See you soon, my brave hero. From now on, I'm forever in your debt.

532
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:13,402
But I am not accustomed to be long in debt.

533
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:22,268
- What's your name? - It's Count, it doesn't matter!

534
00:52:31,241 --> 00:52:33,586
- Is Bolmashov still asleep? - He's snoring all over the place.

535
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:35,716
He must be dreaming sweet dreams when he's frightened.

536
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:41,228
Ah, Count. - Has the Field Marshal arrived? - We're waiting.

537
00:52:44,622 --> 00:52:46,261
Oh, the cornet at last. What about Zharovsky?

538
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:48,835
- He sent a package to the Field Marshal. - Is he tired?

539
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,282
- No. Just a little. Wash your face... You can rest from the road.

540
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:08,084
How long has this valiant cornet been with you?

541
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:10,353
Since the beginning of summer. His name is Azarov,

542
00:53:10,377 --> 00:53:12,615
He's a fine-looking boy. Only seventeen years old.

543
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:16,443
But he's a good match for some of the old soldiers. What do you see in him?

544
00:53:16,704 --> 00:53:20,409
I have a suspicion I've met him.

545
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:22,660
- So what of it? - Nothing, of course.

546
00:53:23,482 --> 00:53:26,946
Only I was less prepared to see him here.

547
00:54:05,288 --> 00:54:11,784
I'm pretty tired from that walk. I'll sigh before the parade.

548
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:16,149
Give these buns to the prisoners.

549
00:54:20,444 --> 00:54:24,048
I wish this chair were closer to the stove.

550
00:54:26,392 --> 00:54:29,774
And a lower curtain, like this.

551
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,249
I've heard that General Bolmashov is here.

552
00:54:38,081 --> 00:54:41,320
I know of his adventure.

553
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,672
Well, I have no more errands to run. Go, all of you.

554
00:55:00,432 --> 00:55:02,246
/ Snore

555
00:55:02,852 --> 00:55:03,629
Ahem.

556
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:10,082
- What's that for you, young man? - A package from Count Zharovsky to you personally!

557
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:12,799
- Come on. What's your name? - Azarov.

558
00:55:13,381 --> 00:55:17,739
Well, that's good. Is Azarov Staff-Major your father?

559
00:55:17,913 --> 00:55:19,041
No, my uncle.

560
00:55:19,473 --> 00:55:24,331
He and I fought together at Ishmael against

561
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:28,460
against the Turks. Yes. That was years ago.

562
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:35,255
But our opponent is more famous. Bonaparte himself. How was it? Am I all right?

563
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:36,745
Very well, Your Grace.

564
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:43,504
It is. I think it's fine. Your first year in the service?

565
00:55:43,678 --> 00:55:45,248
Your Grace, my first.

566
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:50,168
And all at headquarters? It must be boring, isn't it?

567
00:55:50,745 --> 00:55:53,547
I couldn't have lasted a week at your age.

568
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:56,726
- I dare say... - Just give it up.

569
00:55:57,549 --> 00:56:01,273
You can't get your hands dirty in ink. Smell the gunpowder! Yes.

570
00:56:01,511 --> 00:56:03,417
- You've guessed my dream. - That's right.

571
00:56:05,955 --> 00:56:11,064
- Do you want me to leave? - Wait while I read it.

572
00:56:22,065 --> 00:56:27,549
Prince, when I hear that you are here, I want to lay down at your feet.

573
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:31,080
- HQ? - I am here in the militia.

574
00:56:31,594 --> 00:56:36,695
Our nobility is Svarecki of Alov province, representative of Nurin Count.

575
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,700
I have a question for you, a secret one, so to speak.

576
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,882
Well, what's the secret?

577
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:50,091
Go away for a minute, cornet, if the count asks it.

578
00:57:05,137 --> 00:57:07,257
Check it out for yourself, Prince.

579
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:11,993
And I'll vouch for you. All hussars have moustaches, but this cornet...

580
00:57:12,231 --> 00:57:15,583
I'll ask him myself. But in the meantime, don't say a word about the staff.

581
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:18,114
I swear to you, Prince. I'll be as hot as an oven.

582
00:57:18,322 --> 00:57:19,387
Send him to me.

583
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:41,616
- You called, Your Grace? - Yes, Cornet.

584
00:57:45,843 --> 00:57:50,533
- Tell me, how old are you? - Seventeen.

585
00:57:54,288 --> 00:57:58,697
Aren't you afraid to fight in the war? Tell me without lying.

586
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,988
- Oh, Your Grace, no! - I cannot lie.

587
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:03,370
I dare not lie!

588
00:58:06,297 --> 00:58:10,528
And if you dare not lie, then tell me...

589
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:14,822
No, wait.

590
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:21,591
- What is your name, by the way? - According to my uncle, my name is Alexander.

591
00:58:22,305 --> 00:58:25,143
Right. Alexander? When you were a kid, was it Sashka?

592
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:26,910
No. Shurka, Your Grace.

593
00:58:30,275 --> 00:58:35,889
Verkhalyov was in this room just now. Don't you know him? He's yours, from Smolensk.

594
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:36,547
No!

595
00:58:39,534 --> 00:58:44,164
Hasn't he been to your uncle's house before? On occasions?

596
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:54,263
Go on. No, wait! One more question.

597
00:58:54,969 --> 00:59:00,846
Don't be surprised if... Well, cornet, are you a woman?!

598
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:06,448
I can't lie to you, Your Grace. I am a woman.

599
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:14,292
What? How dare you? To make a comedy out of military honor?

600
00:59:14,923 --> 00:59:18,419
I wanted to be a hero. If my country's in trouble, I have no strength to be at home.

601
00:59:18,443 --> 00:59:22,919
No, Mother, you can't fool me! To make a woman a soldier!

602
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:25,832
Without such help, we'd have broken Bonaparte's legs!

603
00:59:26,207 --> 00:59:31,506
And we'll drive him out of Russia without women! What trick did you use to get into the headquarters?

604
00:59:31,614 --> 00:59:35,526
I have a cousin. He was with us in winter. He left his uniform...

605
00:59:35,745 --> 00:59:40,372
Home! To madams, nannies, rags, dolls, dances!

606
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:47,550
Yes. You'll have to get out of here at once! Your uncle doesn't know, does he? Are your parents alive?

607
00:59:47,824 --> 00:59:48,903
I've been an orphan since childhood.

608
00:59:49,278 --> 00:59:56,699
Right. Well, how could you do this deception? A uniform without the right to take it.

609
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:58,414
May I say, Your Grace?

610
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,028
No, I will not! I won't listen to a maiden's babble. Yes.

611
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:07,233
The nonsense of the staff already makes my ears grow dull

612
01:00:07,257 --> 01:00:10,626
of the staff's nonsense enough as it is. Yes. I should feel pity for them at my age.

613
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:15,346
And if the eyes are sharp, the hands are faithful in their sights, and the stirrups are not weak?

614
01:00:15,438 --> 01:00:19,182
And if all - mind, heart, strength, nerves - ask for orders?

615
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:23,363
For thee, country, mother country, to give all for thee. And if...

616
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:29,828
I beg you, speak briefly. I am old, mademoiselle. I'm tired of speeches.

617
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:33,075
And besides, I don't take lectures from young ladies.

618
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:36,989
Off you go. I tell you, the ball is over. Go now.

619
01:00:37,618 --> 01:00:39,914
- Let me stay. - There's nothing to think of.

620
01:00:41,488 --> 01:00:45,876
Well, I beg you, Prince... Well, Your Grace...

621
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:53,614
I'm on my knees now! I beg you... I, I...

622
01:00:57,858 --> 01:01:00,376
Here come the tears in two streams.

623
01:01:02,695 --> 01:01:08,683
If anyone comes in... What do you want them to know about you? Я... I don't want to.

624
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:16,187
Stay here in the hall until the tears are gone. Stop...

625
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:28,129
I want to ask you something else. Did you go to the army, of course, to get a lover?

626
01:01:28,837 --> 01:01:32,130
I don't believe in sinlessness. I've sinned myself.

627
01:01:33,113 --> 01:01:36,877
- What? - My tears are dry all of a sudden.

628
01:01:37,029 --> 01:01:45,787
Have I offended you? Well, pardon the old man, my friend. But I'm going home tonight. That's not the point.

629
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,318
No report for you, Your Grace.

630
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:52,539
- Sit down, General. - From the Emperor.

631
01:01:57,972 --> 01:02:00,109
Did you hear the scandal that happened to me?

632
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:09,212
Yes, it's not good. With a letter like that... Why didn't you have an escort?

633
01:02:09,747 --> 01:02:13,581
I had an escort, but not a big one, alas. If it hadn't been for that young cornet.

634
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,997
The prince, imagine, no. He rode off without telling me his name.

635
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,616
He was in a hurry with his errand. He's just a boy.

636
01:02:20,918 --> 01:02:24,564
That's the kind of boy who makes heroes out of his fatherland.

637
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:31,937
Yes, Russia. In my mind, the Cross should be awarded to him for this deed.

638
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:39,225
Are you still here? Go, and be gone by evening.

639
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:43,213
My respects to your uncle. I'll write to him.

640
01:02:45,702 --> 01:02:49,782
Forgive me, for God's sake. I did not recognise you, my brave friend.

641
01:02:49,964 --> 01:02:51,789
But why are your eyes red?

642
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:56,806
I guess there's a storm coming over you, my humble hero.

643
01:02:57,572 --> 01:03:02,155
By the way, Your Grace, I remember you wished to give him a cross for his deed just now.

644
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:08,370
The prince must not retreat. He hath redeemed the provinces by his deed.

645
01:03:08,947 --> 01:03:12,428
And by the article should be awarded the Cross of St. George and the bow.

646
01:03:14,615 --> 01:03:20,918
Without him, I'd never be alive. Well, Prince! Don't you appreciate at all...

647
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:25,698
...the life of an imperial adjutant? You're welcome to it.

648
01:03:34,714 --> 01:03:43,976
You've earned the cross by right for your exploits. Well, wear it with glory.

649
01:03:45,756 --> 01:03:47,646
I congratulate you.

650
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:53,181
Let me go. I'll stay at headquarters until the parade.

651
01:03:55,783 --> 01:03:57,354
We shall meet again.

652
01:04:07,992 --> 01:04:12,056
I want no reward other than the right to fight in the war for my country.

653
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:16,082
- Let me ask you for this award. - If you've earned it, wear it!

654
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:28,935
That's no way to throw crosses. It's not a hairpin. Say thank you to the general.

655
01:04:29,678 --> 01:04:32,884
- May I stay? - And if anyone finds out?

656
01:04:33,115 --> 01:04:37,569
Like this count, that you... Well, not a man?

657
01:04:38,531 --> 01:04:42,942
I've been here six months. No one in that time has suspected neither face nor rank.

658
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:47,062
And you will tell the count that he was deceived.

659
01:04:48,266 --> 01:04:55,303
Yes. They've been round me on every side. Well... Serve.

660
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:01,618
The rank that you have worn so illicitly, it shall be yours.

661
01:05:02,453 --> 01:05:07,662
But don't throw it like a cross. It's not a comb. Off you go, then.

662
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:12,068
- Thank you, Your Grace. - I'll keep my secret.

663
01:05:12,612 --> 01:05:16,109
I swear I'll keep my military honor! I'll justify your trust.

664
01:05:16,296 --> 01:05:18,995
I do. I do! Go.

665
01:05:26,353 --> 01:05:29,141
- Well? - There's a count at the door.

666
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,279
Well, stay here.

667
01:05:34,747 --> 01:05:38,575
Count! Your anecdote, as I thought it would be, is nonsense.

668
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:42,237
You should joke so low with an adjutant, not with me.

669
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,581
My God, what a passage. I swear it, Your Grace.

670
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:49,797
All right, all right. But don't joke so much again.

671
01:05:49,883 --> 01:05:51,432
Gee...

672
01:05:53,052 --> 01:06:02,274
Oh, it's you, Davyd. Well, brag. I love your lies. Who's that with you?

673
01:06:02,532 --> 01:06:05,870
- Lieutenant Rzhevsky! - You look like a hero.

674
01:06:06,055 --> 01:06:07,343
He'll be the first to fight.

675
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:12,404
I've heard about your desperation. A hero, a hero.

676
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:17,198
- I am flattered by your trust. - You've lived up to it more than once in battle.

677
01:06:19,154 --> 01:06:26,954
Aye. Well done! You would have been a prettier wench.

678
01:06:30,823 --> 01:06:34,746
- Oh, is that you? - Yes, it's me. Bonjour, Lieutenant.

679
01:06:34,842 --> 01:06:36,332
All the staff business?

680
01:06:36,603 --> 01:06:42,379
Business, don't get any better. How was your affair with Mademoiselle Germont?

681
01:06:42,556 --> 01:06:46,601
Haven't you heard? The squad was surrounded. Her enemies took her back the same night.

682
01:06:46,818 --> 01:06:49,231
Oh, my God, and you ran away?

683
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:55,193
Three thousand! We'll duel again when we first meet.

684
01:06:55,429 --> 01:07:00,081
Well. You will not have long to wait. I'm joining your troop from headquarters.

685
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:17,922
I have a riddle to solve. I give you my word that I will keep the secret. Are you or aren't you?

686
01:07:18,225 --> 01:07:24,333
Am I or am I not? But this is new. I am me.

687
01:07:25,259 --> 01:07:32,221
I'm in a hurry now, alas, I have no time for chatter. Goodbye, dear Count!

688
01:07:32,953 --> 01:07:36,108
But still, am I right or am I wrong?

689
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,167
I have taken a prisoner. Of manners, I judge an officer.

690
01:07:56,597 --> 01:07:57,850
Tell me your rank.

691
01:07:58,035 --> 01:08:02,888
Lieutenant. Let me give it back to you From my heart I thank you, forever your friend.

692
01:08:02,965 --> 01:08:04,606
What is the meaning of this oath all of a sudden?

693
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,685
I gave him my coat to keep him warm.

694
01:08:06,771 --> 01:08:08,754
- Are you French? - No, I am a Spaniard.

695
01:08:09,027 --> 01:08:13,243
He is no coward. The cold made him shoot wrong. His hand was shaking.

696
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:18,592
This is the first time I've met such an enemy. I am glad now that I have not killed you in battle.

697
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:21,929
Tell me your part. Well, answer me.

698
01:08:22,104 --> 01:08:23,549
I will not answer that question.

699
01:08:23,924 --> 01:08:25,811
Hmm. The song of the French is sung.

700
01:08:26,004 --> 01:08:29,097
Why must you keep your oath of allegiance?

701
01:08:29,367 --> 01:08:32,879
Or, sir, do I not hear you well? Or do you advise me to betray?

702
01:08:33,826 --> 01:08:36,436
What's in this war for you? For you are not a Frenchman.

703
01:08:36,636 --> 01:08:39,833
I could have betrayed them in their glory. But now you have won.

704
01:08:40,113 --> 01:08:42,660
It is my custom to be faithful to them.

705
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:57,055
By the way, I have a plan for a sortie.

706
01:08:57,401 --> 01:09:01,012
Huh. A plan right off the bat? I can tell you're a staffer.

707
01:09:02,343 --> 01:09:07,155
Well, I'm kidding. Don't be too harsh. We'll talk.

708
01:09:09,866 --> 01:09:12,325
Our little town is on the road...

709
01:09:58,998 --> 01:10:01,923
My lieutenant, this one goes straight to headquarters Through the posts without telling the password.

710
01:10:02,128 --> 01:10:04,914
- We'll find out, go. - A blizzard is raging in the field.

711
01:10:05,155 --> 01:10:09,366
- I've been walking for a long time. I'm tired and so cold. - What do you want here?

712
01:10:09,391 --> 01:10:11,912
- The uniform of the Navarre riflemen. - Are you an officer?

713
01:10:12,298 --> 01:10:15,839
I was a prisoner. I escaped. I'll put my hand on my heart...

714
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:18,328
...no one has ever endured such infernal suffering.

715
01:10:18,352 --> 01:10:20,213
Only I would know where my part is.

716
01:10:20,611 --> 01:10:22,646
Yes, in war, my friend, as in war.

717
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:28,146
Navarre riflemen. Go to the other world, if you look for them. Alas, they are gone.

718
01:10:28,393 --> 01:10:30,808
- They can't be! - Come closer to the fire.

719
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:40,824
Linier. Corneille. Printed in Paris.

720
01:10:41,084 --> 01:10:42,682
I didn't know paper burned like that.

721
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:46,329
- What's your name? - Vincenzo Salgari.

722
01:10:59,988 --> 01:11:02,167
I'll find a corner so as not to disturb you here.

723
01:11:02,379 --> 01:11:06,958
No, Lieutenant, please wait here with us, the General should be back soon.

724
01:11:07,312 --> 01:11:12,330
He'll want to see you, he'll have plenty of questions. He's very curious, our Dewey.

725
01:11:12,759 --> 01:11:14,630
I'll answer them all with pleasure.

726
01:11:17,818 --> 01:11:21,513
My lieutenant, another fugitive, come in. He swears he's a French officer.

727
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:26,271
And showed quite a lot of haste, As we called out. Barely got out of harm's way.

728
01:11:27,429 --> 01:11:32,872
I was a prisoner of war. My regiment was broken long ago. With whom to retreat now, I care not.

729
01:11:33,448 --> 01:11:36,644
But where is your uniform and other regalia? Your rank?

730
01:11:37,348 --> 01:11:42,608
I'm a lieutenant. They took my uniform in captivity. My name is Vincento Salgari.

731
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:50,276
Wait a minute, damn it, I'm seeing double.

732
01:11:50,544 --> 01:11:54,952
It's not... I ask you to repeat your name.

733
01:11:55,219 --> 01:11:58,566
- Vincento Salgari. - And you, my dear knight?

734
01:11:58,909 --> 01:12:00,714
I'm a lieutenant in Murat's corps.

735
01:12:16,645 --> 01:12:20,150
Are you silent? That's great.

736
01:12:21,257 --> 01:12:26,136
Truly, I didn't recognize my brother! He's changed so much, you're alive, Vincento!

737
01:12:26,183 --> 01:12:28,870
- You're both Vincento? - Damn it.

738
01:12:29,129 --> 01:12:32,046
From birth to the grave it's our ancient ancestral law

739
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:35,073
that all men are called Vincento in the family.

740
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:38,747
Yes, I confess I haven't seen a moment like this in a long time.

741
01:12:39,197 --> 01:12:42,491
- I thought one of you was a spy. - Yes, but which one, me or him?

742
01:12:42,761 --> 01:12:44,794
Come sit by the fire, you're cold, aren't you?

743
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,094
Yes, from my socks to my head.

744
01:13:11,028 --> 01:13:13,876
Thank you. I had no right to expect this from you.

745
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:18,803
Allow me to congratulate you. You ran apart, but you met in our place.

746
01:13:20,283 --> 01:13:23,633
What a romance. But the fire is almost out.

747
01:13:23,794 --> 01:13:33,093
What are you burning? Oh, Barney, Rassin.

748
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:41,226
The disposition of the main Russian forces, I wonder.

749
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,161
What can you tell me? Well, you first.

750
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:47,041
Ready, my general, to tell me all I know.

751
01:13:47,701 --> 01:13:51,849
No, sit down. You're tired. Well, I'm tired too.

752
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:56,529
- Where do I start? - Don't say a word, my friend.

753
01:13:56,755 --> 01:13:59,690
- Die, but keep your mouth shut. - What's that supposed to mean?

754
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:03,681
The ravings of a sick man! Why did you leave your bed? Go upstairs.

755
01:14:08,538 --> 01:14:13,392
No, wait. Which one do you know? Tell me.

756
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:16,173
You, my angel, do not fear their threats.

757
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:19,937
Don't answer their questions. For you are a maiden, not a soldier.

758
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:25,956
Are you a woman?! How could you dare?

759
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,778
She is my niece. I give you my word. She's seventeen years old.

760
01:14:30,019 --> 01:14:32,639
- That's new. - There's a whole family of spies.

761
01:14:32,896 --> 01:14:36,142
Who's the other one? Is he your nephew too? Or who?

762
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:37,091
Oh, dear...

763
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,354
I don't know who he is. This is the first time I have seen him.

764
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:43,580
Did you not lend her your uniform, that you betrayed your oath?

765
01:14:43,815 --> 01:14:46,512
I swear I took it without asking! He did not know.

766
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:55,966
No more questions. Yea, it is clear to me. Take him out. And shoot these men in the morning.

767
01:15:36,822 --> 01:15:40,797
Davyd! The cornet was captured! I barely escaped the pursuit.

768
01:15:41,558 --> 01:15:48,320
Now there's no need to wait for help! Alert! All hands on horseback!

769
01:16:39,676 --> 01:16:41,526
Three thousand devils!

770
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:46,308
You saved me, I am eternally grateful!

771
01:16:46,544 --> 01:16:50,657
- Madam, I never expected to meet you. - I'm still so happy to meet you.

772
01:16:50,862 --> 01:16:52,599
But your cousin, is he still alive now?

773
01:16:52,922 --> 01:16:58,055
Of course he is! He's locked up there in the closet. I'll get him. No, wait here.

774
01:16:58,706 --> 01:17:05,318
I'm soaked from all this riding. Three thousand devils, a date like in a novel.

775
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:23,749
- Lieutenant, I am your slave. - I'll settle up with you. Who's that dandy?

776
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:25,672
Our friend, though a French lieutenant.

777
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,154
You bastards! They started shooting again.

778
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,029
It's dawn.

779
01:19:59,423 --> 01:20:02,573
The general wanted to shoot us at dawn.

780
01:20:06,036 --> 01:20:14,096
He keeps his word... At least as far as I'm concerned.

781
01:20:21,879 --> 01:20:25,322
There's still fighting. Do you hear that thunder? Let's go, Cornet.

782
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,111
We can't leave the house. Orders and maps are here.

783
01:20:28,635 --> 01:20:31,010
It's good booty. Let them know our partisan

784
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:33,589
It is the custom of our partisans to beat the enemies of the fatherland until they have surrendered.

785
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:37,501
I know not how to thank you. You saved me,

786
01:20:37,525 --> 01:20:40,712
my uncle and my cousin. She's probably out of her senses now.

787
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:41,852
It's nothing, brother.

788
01:20:44,685 --> 01:20:47,308
Besides, I'll bet she imagined, of course...

789
01:20:47,568 --> 01:20:50,820
...that you came here so brazenly for her.

790
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:55,869
Don't talk nonsense. Why don't you load your gun? The fight's not over yet.

791
01:20:57,342 --> 01:21:01,756
Do you remember, Lieutenant, the wager? If you save the girl...

792
01:21:02,014 --> 01:21:06,126
...you will marry her. We shall soon be feasting at the wedding?

793
01:21:06,437 --> 01:21:10,433
That's no good! I wanted to save you, but I don't care about her.

794
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:17,427
The whole troop witnessed the bet. You shouldn't refuse. I'm awfully glad...

795
01:21:17,717 --> 01:21:21,086
...to congratulate you on your enviable lot in life. So you're getting married?

796
01:21:21,366 --> 01:21:25,042
I don't want to hear any more of your nonsense. I've lost the wager, but know this...

797
01:21:25,269 --> 01:21:28,129
...you will not feast at your wedding! We'll continue the duel.

798
01:21:28,566 --> 01:21:32,396
But, indeed, the occasion is small. And too uncomfortable here at the manor.

799
01:21:32,603 --> 01:21:35,478
If thou art not a coward, I pray thee, come to the barrier!

800
01:21:35,927 --> 01:21:42,040
Save me, and kill me again? Well, that's right, it's too hussar-like. Shall we postpone it?

801
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:45,442
You're a coward, you punk! Boy!

802
01:21:54,428 --> 01:22:01,815
Shoot on the count of three! I'm counting! One, two...

803
01:22:02,453 --> 01:22:04,218
Stop, gentlemen!

804
01:22:05,826 --> 01:22:08,138
- I made it. - Three thousand devils!

805
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:09,790
Haven't you had enough deaths in the war?!

806
01:22:09,994 --> 01:22:13,018
Where do you come from, Germont? Be a witness, as to this dandy...

807
01:22:13,223 --> 01:22:16,468
I'll put a bullet in his forehead! Cornet, to the barrier!

808
01:22:16,757 --> 01:22:20,881
My God, who are these people? Don't you dare, gentlemen. I don't want it at all.

809
01:22:21,038 --> 01:22:25,418
I'll make it up to you, just a word. You want to fight over me?

810
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:29,920
Then know that I love the other. I do not care for either of you.

811
01:22:30,093 --> 01:22:30,778
Alas!

812
01:22:31,017 --> 01:22:35,162
Mademoiselle Germain, what's that got to do with us? You may love the devil. Be my guest.

813
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:39,694
I am insulted by the cornet. Only by blood can I wash away this insult.

814
01:22:50,519 --> 01:22:56,588
Mademoiselle Germont? That's strange. We're lucky to meet her now.

815
01:22:56,931 --> 01:22:59,021
- The arm, what's wrong with it? - Ah, an empty wound.

816
01:22:59,496 --> 01:23:02,486
Pierre, my friend. For you, believe me, I long.

817
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,143
It's hard to believe it.

818
01:23:04,514 --> 01:23:08,629
Pierre, don't say that. I'm terribly glad. I believe happiness is given to us...

819
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:12,292
- Mademoiselle Germont! - Louise. Call me as you used to call me.

820
01:23:12,522 --> 01:23:16,965
Kiss me as you kissed me before We quarreled at my whim

821
01:23:17,234 --> 01:23:22,457
- I blame myself. - Louisa. Louisa, I'm an ass.

822
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,346
- Again, Germont! Brother, however, - Where is the cornet?

823
01:23:44,841 --> 01:23:46,786
He and the Lieutenant went there to shoot.

824
01:23:46,978 --> 01:23:47,822
Oh, shit!

825
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,395
No, you can't do without a crowbar here.

826
01:23:57,569 --> 01:24:01,837
I am Azarov. I'm the owner of this house. Retired staff-major.

827
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:06,816
- And your eternally obedient subject. - Cornet Azarov is your nephew?

828
01:24:07,027 --> 01:24:09,291
- Niece. - What do you mean?

829
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,518
- What is this nonsense? - I think he's delirious. - I see.

830
01:24:12,861 --> 01:24:17,340
You doubt it for nothing. Ivan can tell you. He's been babysitting her since she was a baby.

831
01:24:17,534 --> 01:24:18,857
A maiden, that's right.

832
01:24:19,051 --> 01:24:22,290
What an affair! And I thought the old man was a child!

833
01:24:22,314 --> 01:24:24,765
- Ah, ah, ah! /Shots fired/

834
01:24:25,053 --> 01:24:27,220
- God have mercy. - Break down the door!

835
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:40,534
- Killed?! - Wounded? - Oh, my God!

836
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:46,432
- You will answer me now. - There's the duelist, too.

837
01:24:46,662 --> 01:24:51,363
He saw a mouse and fell unconscious. That's the kind of ending that makes me want to shoot.

838
01:24:51,547 --> 01:24:52,105
You did shoot, didn't you?

839
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:56,583
Yes. In a mouse hunt, I killed a few, missed one. That's a shame.

840
01:24:57,841 --> 01:25:00,134
Please, you've got to slow down.

841
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:03,742
She's always been afraid of mice, ever since she was a baby.

842
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:07,224
- She?! Allow me, sir. I must...

843
01:25:07,408 --> 01:25:09,954
You must? Oh, damn, am I dreaming?

844
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:13,442
I must ask your forgiveness, all of you, for my deceit.

845
01:25:15,085 --> 01:25:19,651
- She's a maiden! - My friend, it's a sin to judge success.

846
01:25:21,642 --> 01:25:24,153
I must present you, for your valor, to the rank of Lieutenant.

847
01:25:24,177 --> 01:25:26,004
to the rank of lieutenant.

848
01:25:26,414 --> 01:25:28,383
- You are too kind. - But how...

849
01:25:28,558 --> 01:25:29,939
Better be silent, brother.

850
01:25:33,441 --> 01:25:36,731
I pray you, gentlemen, champagne. In honour of deliverance.

851
01:25:37,043 --> 01:25:40,478
- What doubt can there be? - You're right, my friend! Come, come!

852
01:26:10,678 --> 01:26:16,315
Lieutenant, wait, where are you going? You and I still have some explaining to do, don't we?

853
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:21,846
Do you agree with me? How long your astonishment lasts.

854
01:26:22,381 --> 01:26:30,403
Yes, I am not a man. Alas, alas, alas. Are you sorry, too? For you are my teacher...

855
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:41,270
...in hussar's prowess. Well, why are you silent? Tell me, do you love me?

856
01:26:41,785 --> 01:26:45,164
He that is in sound mind will not live a day who is in love with you.

857
01:26:45,509 --> 01:26:47,951
No, speak plainly, are you in love with me?

858
01:26:48,126 --> 01:26:50,835
He who loves you, yes, would jump out of his mind.

859
01:26:51,222 --> 01:26:53,203
I'm as stubborn as you are. Yes or no?

860
01:26:53,550 --> 01:27:03,956
- I'd like to say goodbye to you forever. - Good. But still, do you love? Well?

861
01:27:04,295 --> 01:27:10,631
Yes. Three thousand devils. No, that doesn't sound like anything.

862
01:27:10,984 --> 01:27:13,827
That's the compote. No, better a hundred deaths. I'm

863
01:27:13,851 --> 01:27:16,393
I'm ashamed to look you in the eye, believe me.

864
01:27:16,759 --> 01:27:19,221
You are in love and beg for death, but why?

865
01:27:19,532 --> 01:27:23,725
You must despise me, I was an ass. Farewell.

866
01:27:23,964 --> 01:27:28,671
Wait. Once we were so friendly, remember, That we were so friendly?

867
01:27:29,528 --> 01:27:33,083
Knit your hands, what the devil am I saying? If

868
01:27:33,107 --> 01:27:36,990
I beg your pardon for that impertinence at the ball.

869
01:27:38,164 --> 01:27:47,184
You kissed me that night, too. I am indebted to you. Now I'll repay it.

870
01:27:51,903 --> 01:27:56,117
Well, you may go. What are you doing?

871
01:27:58,285 --> 01:28:03,951
I'll be right back. Do you remember the bet?

872
01:28:06,121 --> 01:28:08,524
- Well? - If I save the girl...

873
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:14,186
You must marry her, don't you think? I'll spare you the bet.

874
01:28:14,685 --> 01:28:19,309
It was very unpleasant for you, you do not tolerate my cousin. I mean me.

875
01:28:19,843 --> 01:28:22,171
I swear to you now, I have never loved so!

876
01:28:23,412 --> 01:28:26,366
I'll seek death in battle if you will not agree to be mine.

877
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:34,001
Farewell forever. I'm going, but if... Shit!

878
01:28:34,078 --> 01:28:39,361
My knight, wait! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

879
01:28:48,135 --> 01:28:51,823
/ Singing a song / Life takes us a long way.

880
01:28:51,847 --> 01:28:55,401
To laugh, to cry or not to cry all the same.

881
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:58,919
When the chorus is old and old and old

882
01:28:58,943 --> 01:29:03,302
Once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time.

883
01:29:03,817 --> 01:29:11,076
I used to fight all kinds of things! Bottles of many, very many have seen the bottom!

884
01:29:11,654 --> 01:29:14,924
But I've never been so in love.

885
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:18,973
Long time ago, long time ago, long time ago!

886
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:27,202
To the hero with the puffy moustache My heart, my heart was given forever.

887
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:30,586
How long have we been enemies?

888
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:35,031
Long ago, long ago, long ago, long ago!

889
01:29:35,872 --> 01:29:43,202
The years will pass, and from the distance Of years gone by, of years gone by One glimpses:

890
01:29:43,757 --> 01:29:46,291
How our grandfathers fought.

891
01:29:46,315 --> 01:29:51,112
Long time ago, long time ago, long time ago!

892
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:55,984
And if the enemy, in the blind hope of conquering Russia.

893
01:29:56,008 --> 01:29:59,540
Will come to us again, will come to us again...

894
01:30:00,105 --> 01:30:08,821
We'll chase him, just like before - Long, long, long ago, long ago!

895
01:30:09,009 --> 01:30:13,870
