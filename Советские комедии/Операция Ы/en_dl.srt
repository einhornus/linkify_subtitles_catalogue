1
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:41,502
- Sit down, daughter. - Nothing, nothing, thank you, sit down.

2
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:48,616
- Citizen, give way, stand up! - If I stand up, you'll lie down.

3
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,055
Citizen, these seats are for children and disabled people.

4
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:02,726
- What is she, children or handicapped? - She's getting ready to be a mother.

5
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:07,925
- And I'm getting ready to be a father! - What are you talking nonsense!

6
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:15,933
- That's exactly what a handicapped person is. - Ah, an invalid. - What do you say now?

7
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:23,602
- The law is the law! - Please sit down.

8
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:28,368
You sighted one! Now you'll be blind.

9
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:39,923
- Do you confirm it? - Affirmative! Affirmative.

10
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,480
So... So the victim...

11
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,725
- You work in construction? - Part-time.

12
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,833
- What do you mean "moonlighting"? - I'm a polytechnic student.

13
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:57,999
A student!

14
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:03,991
Fifteen days!

15
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:42,505
Well, citizens alcoholics, hooligans, slackers,

16
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:45,988
who wants to work today?

17
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,466
Today's assignments are: Sand pit - 2 people.

18
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:56,703
Sandy Quarry, two men.

19
00:04:57,107 --> 00:05:01,577
- Give me the whole list, please. - Sandpiper Quarry, two men.

20
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,934
Street cleaning, 3 men.

21
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:08,180
Meatpacking...

22
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:12,133
has not sent outfits as of today.

23
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:17,930
There's an order for an apartment building, a cement factory...

24
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:22,140
No orders for the liquor store?

25
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,002
Please.

26
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:10,160
Careful.

27
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:13,799
First of all, I want you to meet our wonderful team,

28
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,482
which you are temporarily joining.

29
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:22,197
- How much is a comrade joining? - Full, 15! - Aha! A decade and a half.

30
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:25,958
Don't be late for lunch!

31
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:31,114
I'm sure you and I will spend this decade and a half in an atmosphere of friendship and

32
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,394
- of mutual understanding. - Yeah.

33
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:40,799
Cork. A gift from Africa. Yes! Right this way.

34
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:48,197
Imagine with the power of your imagination the housing estate that will be created here.

35
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:52,392
There will be 7,40 gas stoves installed in this one alone,

36
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:58,195
which is 7,40 times more than there were in the whole city before 1913. Please!

37
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:10,665
Romance. And if you take all the work done by our SMU floor-by-floor.

38
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:14,864
during the first quarter and put those floors one on top of the other, you get a building

39
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:19,228
will be twice as tall as the world-famous Eiffel Tower,

40
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,738
or three times as tall as the famous Notre Dame de Paris.

41
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:30,021
Which means Notre Dame de Paris. What, what mother?

42
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:34,505
Paris. Notre Dame.

43
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,662
Please.

44
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:46,658
Our SMU has built as much living space as one city like Chita, 10 like Khvalynsk, or 32 like Kryzhopol.

45
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:53,816
city like Chita, 10 like Khvalynsk, or 32 Kryzhopol.

46
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,258
It's breathtaking to think that...

47
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:04,654
than in America. That way, you, too, can do your part.

48
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:09,015
to the work accomplishments of our construction and installation department.

49
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:14,803
- What what department? - The erection department. - I'm ready!

50
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:20,165
Shurik!

51
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:25,686
- Yes, Pal Stepanych? - Well, Sanya, here's your partner.

52
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:30,531
Finally, Pal Stepanych, thank you!

53
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:41,402
- Well, now we'll work. - Let's work together.

54
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,586
Well, I can see that you will work together. Stand up, Shurik.

55
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:29,466
I wish you success in your work and great happiness in your personal life.

56
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,783
Thank you for your attention.

57
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:46,425
Listen, have you had any accidents at the construction site?

58
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:50,783
- No, there haven't been any yet. - There will be... let's go...

59
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,839
Lord have mercy!

60
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:23,759
Lord have mercy!

61
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:28,441
- What's in there? - Shh!

62
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:36,591
Listen, where have you been? I've been looking all over the building for you. There's work to be done.

63
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:41,996
The work is standing, and the deadline is running. Don't forget, you're counting in rubles, and I'm counting in days.

64
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:36,888
- So, Shurik, how's your partner? - Re-educated. - He's doing great.

65
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,844
Why are you whispering? Asleep. Asleep?!

66
00:13:55,606 --> 00:14:01,043
While our spaceships are sailing across the universe...

67
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:31,944
and it's not without reason that all the continents applaud the workers of our great ballet...

68
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:44,663
Folk wisdom teaches us that patience and hard work will make everything better - one!

69
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,665
Finish the job - walk bravely - two!

70
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:52,705
Work is not the wolf - into the woods ... No, don't do that...

71
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:16,301
To the light bulb!

72
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:01,805
- And the compote? - The compote!

73
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,042
- Hands... - Huh? Washed? - А... Yes, yes, yes.

74
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:52,315
So... To the sand pit!

75
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:03,709
- Here we go... - Bon appétit.

76
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,141
What's that?

77
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:36,145
I say: He who does not work - he eats. Study, student!

78
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:24,005
Understand, student, nowadays you have to be gentler to people, and look at the issues more broadly...

79
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:37,003
Do you think I got 15 days?

80
00:18:39,971 --> 00:18:43,804
We're the ones who got 15 days. What for?

81
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,803
So that you could educate me... And I grow on myself.

82
00:18:54,408 --> 00:19:00,356
Go on, tell me how spaceships sail... Big theater...

83
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:06,278
I'll take a nap.

84
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,955
That's right... And keep the flies away.

85
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:47,504
- You what?! - Fly. - Well done!

86
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:11,671
Oh, you're in trouble, four-eyes, aren't you?

87
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:19,787
It's just an advance. That's it! Well, student, get ready.

88
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:24,309
Soon you'll be wearing a wooden raincoat and your house will be playing

89
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,510
music... But you won't hear it.

90
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:31,187
Water!

91
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:45,975
Thank you.

92
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,542
Stop, I'll kill... Student!

93
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:55,343
That's hooliganism! You'll get 15 days in jail!

94
00:27:57,105 --> 00:27:59,744
I'm going to complain!

95
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:06,975
Are you going to hit me? No. Why?

96
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:14,055
To educate you.

97
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:25,577
- Shurik... Are you a Komsomol member? - Yes. That's not our method.

98
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:30,689
Where's the humanism? Where is man to man? Understand, Shurik, at a time when

99
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:34,245
spaceships, as you know, are sailing... - What's your name?

100
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:38,647
- Fedya... And you, Shurik... - Married? - Yes, my wife Lyubushka

101
00:28:39,254 --> 00:28:43,531
and two kids, Lena and Alyosha. So there's a family. Yes, we do.

102
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,532
- How old are you? - 41.

103
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:53,408
Maybe you shouldn't, Shurik?

104
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:59,999
- I won't do it anymore. - No, you have to, Fedya... You have to!

105
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:04,959
Mama.

106
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:07,320
Mom.

107
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,358
Mama.

108
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:15,603
Well, citizens, alcoholics, slackers, hooligans.

109
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:18,842
Who wants to work? Я! Wait.

110
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:24,831
For today's outfit: Sand pit - 2 people. - Я! - Wait a minute!

111
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:29,914
Give me the whole list, please.

112
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:34,113
So, the cement factory... Я!

113
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,748
- Loading coal... - Я! Cleaning the stables... Я!

114
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:42,433
Also... Я! Wait a minute, citizen.

115
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:48,229
You're on personal duty for the full 15 days. Take it!

116
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,495
- Did you pass? - Deal! - How much? Well? - Five.

117
00:30:55,978 --> 00:31:00,129
- Give me the synopsis... Burning. - No, I gave it to the guys, they're reading it.

118
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:16,405
You can turn it upside down.

119
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:40,199
Ticket number 7, first question...

120
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:50,078
The principle of the synchrophasotron. Kostya, how do you hear? How do you hear?

121
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:54,436
Can you hear me? Over.

122
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:58,881
I got it, I got it. I hear you all right,

123
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:06,030
I'll answer the first question of the seventh ticket. The synchrophasotron is based on the principle

124
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,988
is based on the acceleration of charged particles by a magnetic field.

125
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:20,674
A field. Let's move on.

126
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:30,705
- Dub! Do you have a synopsis? - There's no synopsis, don't interfere.

127
00:32:30,953 --> 00:32:33,592
- What are you listening to? - Van Cliburn. Go!

128
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:29,935
- Great! - That's great! - Do you have one? - What?

129
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:34,047
Oh, I already asked you!

130
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:42,373
- Careful, citizen. - Don't get distracted. - Excuse me, please.

131
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:04,248
- Next Garden! - Ours, let's go!

132
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:15,000
Take it.

133
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:19,118
Who?

134
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:03,968
Hello, Aunt Zoya. Can I have the key, please?

135
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:09,765
- You have an exam today. - You've got three more hours.

136
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:13,770
I'll study with my girlfriend.

137
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,769
- Mustards! - Uh-huh!

138
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,062
It's stuffy! Don't flip it.

139
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:31,652
Ira, unbutton it.

140
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:47,164
It's hot! Take off your clothes.

141
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:52,234
It's time.

142
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:06,513
- Did you pass? - 4!

143
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:16,469
You what? Calm down. I see.

144
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:30,142
Get your ticket!

145
00:40:38,425 --> 00:40:43,657
- Professor, can I have some more? - Please.

146
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,378
- More! - Take it!

147
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:07,409
- For yourself! - What do you mean, yourself?

148
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:12,608
- Oh, I'm sorry, Professor. - No, I'm sorry.

149
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:19,407
- You'll come next time. - Too much.

150
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:28,482
A beauty's heart is prone to cheating and change... One, two, three, I'll give you a sample.

151
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:34,244
Kostya, do you read me? Three, two, one, over!

152
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,608
- Hello, professor. - How do you do?

153
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,758
- What's wrong with you? - My ear hurts.

154
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:48,406
- Will it bother you? - No, Professor, don't worry.

155
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:53,115
On the contrary, it helps. No noise distracts you from your exam.

156
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:59,355
What's that about? Do you have a holiday today?

157
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:06,277
The exam... for me... always a holiday for me, Professor.

158
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:12,520
That's commendable.

159
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,111
Please... ticket!

160
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:24,109
Ticket number 9. Over!

161
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:29,671
- What-what did you say? - What? What reception?

162
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:33,391
I said not reception, but with him. Ticket No. 9, and in front of him - the task.

163
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:42,029
- I see. Go get ready. - All right.

164
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:54,662
Oak, can you hear me? How can you hear me? You didn't get it, did you?

165
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,739
I'm dictating the answer to question 1 on ticket 9. So...

166
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:11,174
- What's the matter with you? - It shoots in my ear!

167
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:27,529
Here's the deal. I got an A for invention and an F for the course.

168
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:41,131
The professor, of course, is a lump, but he has the equipment.

169
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:45,734
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

170
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:50,045
- You're welcome. - Thank you very much!

171
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:24,159
Did you pass?

172
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:41,075
- Who's that? - Where? There... floating.

173
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,994
Oh, it's Lydka from the parallel stream!

174
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:56,549
Lida... Amazing girl...

175
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:04,194
- Why haven't I ever seen her before? - Would you like to meet her?

176
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,383
- No... no! - Oh, come on! Lida!

177
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:11,433
Can I talk to you for a minute?

178
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,462
- Did you pass? - I did! - How many? - 5! - Congratulations! - Thank you!

179
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:36,137
- Meet your friends. - Lida! - Petya! Eh, Sasha!

180
00:45:39,426 --> 00:45:41,462
Lida!

181
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:51,773
Please.

182
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:02,970
I'm off.

183
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:27,477
- Well, I'm home now. - This is where you live?

184
00:47:30,877 --> 00:47:34,312
Nice neighborhood you got here. Never been here before.

185
00:47:39,075 --> 00:47:43,784
I don't know. It must be the new tenants. How do I get in?

186
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,027
Very simple. It's a distraction. I'll take care of the dog,

187
00:47:48,313 --> 00:47:50,826
- and you make a quick run for it. - All right.

188
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:55,305
Jack... Jack! Dumka... Smokey... Polkan!

189
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:01,863
Polkan! Almochka... Almochka... Almochka...

190
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:04,543
Come on!

191
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:13,856
- Do you happen to have any sausage with you? - Yes, doctor's sausage.

192
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:28,093
- There was a doctorate... Now it's an amateur... - What's that? - Sleeping pills.

193
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:31,692
- It's not... - No, it's perfectly harmless.

194
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,852
No, Bobiku... Bob!

195
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:53,844
Here we go, in three minutes we'll have a deep, healthy sleep. There you go!

196
00:49:03,653 --> 00:49:07,406
Ah, that's it! Well, we'll see who's who. I'll be right back.

197
00:49:28,046 --> 00:49:31,322
- What about you back? - The next step is this: On my signal.

198
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:36,803
You open the front door, but remember, only on my signal. Here you go.

199
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:40,116
Places, everybody. Okay.

200
00:49:48,081 --> 00:49:51,789
Open up!

201
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:03,033
- Only you already have to walk. - Don't get used to it, the elevator often breaks down.

202
00:50:09,596 --> 00:50:12,632
- I'm very glad to meet you. - Me too, goodbye.

203
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:21,383
- Sasha! What have you got there? - Where? Here!

204
00:50:23,112 --> 00:50:27,980
- A dog! - Let's go upstairs, I'll sew it up. - No, it's the first time in the house and like this...

205
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,983
- No, let's go. - No way, no.

206
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:42,386
And I have a throat. - Your throat? And your head? No brains! No brains...

207
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:10,931
- Hello! - Well, did you pass? - 5! - Well done!

208
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:16,536
- And the girlfriend? - I don't know... Let's go! - Goodbye!

209
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:41,567
Turn around, I'll sew it up.

210
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:45,448
- No, let me do it. - Please.

211
00:51:57,887 --> 00:52:00,639
Well, I won't bother you...

212
00:52:35,797 --> 00:52:39,835
- Lida! It's okay! - I'll be right back!

213
00:53:56,976 --> 00:54:02,413
Lida, do you know what my favorite poem by Yaroslav Smelyakov is?

214
00:54:02,694 --> 00:54:05,447
- What is it? - Listen to this.

215
00:54:06,773 --> 00:54:11,084
Along the little white houses Acacia trees are in full bloom.

216
00:54:11,372 --> 00:54:15,922
Good girl Lida On South Street lives.

217
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:22,808
Reflected in the window pane She walks slowly through the world...

218
00:54:33,726 --> 00:54:35,523
and then you forget the rest?

219
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:40,319
In the window pane Reflecting in the world walks slowly...

220
00:54:40,604 --> 00:54:43,596
- Good girl Lida... - What's she good for?

221
00:54:44,244 --> 00:54:48,122
Ask the boy who lives across the street,

222
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:52,596
He goes to bed with that name and rises with that name.

223
00:54:53,921 --> 00:54:58,038
Not without reason on the stone slabs Where the sweet shoe has gone.

224
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,197
"Good girl Lida" He wrote in despair.

225
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:08,347
People can't help but be touched by the boy's stubborn fervor.

226
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:12,710
That's how Pushkin must have fallen in love... That's...

227
00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:24,266
What's wrong with you? - No, nothing. Where was I? - Pushkin.

228
00:55:29,552 --> 00:55:35,307
Yeah... Yeah... Pushkin... there's a miracle, there's a wizard... A mermaid...

229
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:41,027
- Wait, what mermaid, Sasha? - Hanging on the branches... Lying...

230
00:55:41,948 --> 00:55:45,496
I think you've overtrained.

231
00:55:51,426 --> 00:55:57,863
No, I'm not overtraining. That's not what I have.

232
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:04,615
Lida, I want to ask you a serious question.

233
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:10,773
- It's very important to me. - Go ahead.

234
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,738
Don't you ever come to a place for the first time, and it seems to you

235
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:22,971
You think you've been here before, and everything is familiar to you: Objects, smells, sounds.

236
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:32,965
Doesn't that happen to you? - No, it doesn't. I always remember where I was, when and with whom.

237
00:56:38,893 --> 00:56:41,851
I have a feeling I've been here before.

238
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:49,369
And now I feel like I've been here before. - Come on, Sasha!

239
00:56:50,091 --> 00:56:53,526
Yes, yes, I've seen everything here before.

240
00:56:57,768 --> 00:57:03,205
Now I'm going to pull back this curtain,

241
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:10,756
and there's a crystal jug behind it!

242
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:17,277
There was!

243
00:57:19,963 --> 00:57:25,274
- Sasha! So you're a telepath! Wolf Messing! - You think so?

244
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:29,196
- That's right! Let's try... - Let's do it.

245
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,875
You walk out the door... I write my wish on a piece of paper...

246
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,152
And when you come back, I'll mentally order you to grant my wish...

247
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:42,112
- Shall we? - Let's do it.

248
00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:00,545
Come in!

249
00:59:01,776 --> 00:59:07,371
- Did you get it? - Almost.

250
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,128
Then I'll try again?

251
00:59:32,808 --> 00:59:35,037
It's time.

252
00:59:37,886 --> 00:59:44,836
See you tomorrow. - No, the day after tomorrow. The day after tomorrow is an exam. - So do I.

253
00:59:46,644 --> 00:59:50,636
- I'll study tomorrow... - So am I.

254
00:59:51,603 --> 00:59:58,518
- So the day after tomorrow, after the exam? - Yes, the day after tomorrow...

255
01:01:08,263 --> 01:01:14,734
Citizens of the new settlers! Get the culture going: Hang mats on the drywall.

256
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:21,735
No modernism, no abstractionism,

257
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:24,970
Keeps the walls from damp, you from rheumatism.

258
01:01:25,778 --> 01:01:30,532
Get in, get in a hurry, buy the painting.

259
01:01:31,857 --> 01:01:37,088
I recommend, the classic subject "Mermaid", based on the opera of the same name,

260
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,567
- music by Dargomyzhsky, words by Pushkin. - The humbug!

261
01:01:41,854 --> 01:01:46,131
There is a quite neutral plot, even recommended for use

262
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:50,843
in children's institutions. Please. Oh, not that, sorry, here... please.

263
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,367
Wrap it up.

264
01:02:58,834 --> 01:03:03,065
Wrap it up. There's a case.

265
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:31,624
- Where the hell is the invalid? - Don't make any noise, I'm an invalid.

266
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,168
- This is what we have today. - Not us, but you.

267
01:03:56,299 --> 01:04:00,813
- What can save us from revision: - Excuse me, not us, but you!

268
01:04:02,177 --> 01:04:07,125
The only thing that can save us from an audit is theft!

269
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:11,124
- With or without burglary? - Well, burglary, of course.

270
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:20,209
Article 89, paragraph 2, up to six years. No deal.

271
01:04:20,532 --> 01:04:25,400
There won't be any theft.

272
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:29,483
- Everything's already been stolen before us... - Everything's been stolen before us...

273
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:34,759
It's nothing. All you have to do is fake a theft.

274
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:41,523
You have to pick the lock, break into the warehouse, leave traces of the theft

275
01:04:41,807 --> 01:04:47,880
and walk away without taking anything. Have you got it all figured out?

276
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:53,559
Don't worry, Comrade Director. People want to find out what's what.

277
01:04:54,203 --> 01:04:56,080
- It's natural! - Legally!

278
01:04:56,523 --> 01:05:02,073
- This case is new for us, not mastered. - Exactly, untapped.

279
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,429
Tell me, is this event...

280
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:15,393
Or should I say... operation... Ы!

281
01:05:17,197 --> 01:05:20,667
Operation Y!

282
01:05:21,796 --> 01:05:23,787
Why "U"?

283
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:32,391
- Why "Y"? - So no one would guess.

284
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:41,747
Idiot!

285
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:47,783
Well, get to the point. First of all, you need to neutralize the watchman...

286
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:51,947
- Not us, but you. - This time it's you! - Yes? Yes!

287
01:05:53,348 --> 01:05:56,339
What do you mean, neutralize?

288
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:06,744
- Article 193, paragraph 2. Up to three years. No, he won't. - No, he won't.

289
01:06:07,704 --> 01:06:09,422
No...

290
01:06:11,623 --> 01:06:16,616
The watchman is gently sedated with chloroform and tied up.

291
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:23,728
Legally, the whole operation is just disorderly conduct.

292
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:30,327
Yes, and keep in mind that for this petty hooliganism I pay a lot of money.

293
01:06:32,218 --> 01:06:34,412
There will be an advance!

294
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,734
Is the watchman strong?

295
01:06:37,017 --> 01:06:39,928
On the night of the operation there will be a guard on duty, a grandmother - God's dandelion.

296
01:06:43,175 --> 01:06:45,893
- Is she armed? - Blanks! Any other questions?

297
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,284
- How much? - Three hundred!

298
01:06:59,011 --> 01:07:05,528
- You can't be serious! - No, it's not. - You don't know us and we don't know you.

299
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:09,727
Look for fools. - I'll make more money on mermaids. - Come on, let's go.

300
01:07:10,048 --> 01:07:13,756
- It's a laughing matter. - It's only 300! - Wait!

301
01:07:14,567 --> 01:07:16,522
What are your terms?

302
01:07:27,563 --> 01:07:33,592
- 330! - Agreed. - Everyone! - I agree!

303
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:39,031
Godspeed!

304
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:02,256
Stop, stop, stop. What are you guys doing? We've been rehearsing for an hour.

305
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:08,165
I let them mutilate my own barn for this, and it's no use.

306
01:09:09,217 --> 01:09:14,733
Here you are, as a passerby, to approach the old woman

307
01:09:15,215 --> 01:09:20,572
and get her attention with a simple question. And what did you ask?

308
01:09:21,253 --> 01:09:26,485
- How to get to the library? - At 3 o'clock in the morning! Idiot!

309
01:09:27,732 --> 01:09:32,009
- And you? What were you supposed to do? - Stand guard...

310
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:36,368
and appear before the police in the form of a vigilante, if the old woman whistled.

311
01:09:37,129 --> 01:09:40,803
- Did the old lady whistle? - No. Then why did you come?

312
01:09:41,568 --> 01:09:44,400
- Dummy. - I agree.

313
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,360
And you?

314
01:09:48,606 --> 01:09:53,201
You idiot, you're not supposed to steal those bottles, you're supposed to break them.

315
01:09:55,924 --> 01:10:00,792
- Break them? - Break them. - Half a pint? - Half a pint.

316
01:10:01,723 --> 01:10:04,839
- In pieces? - Of course, smash it.

317
01:10:06,642 --> 01:10:08,871
- I'll get you for that... - But! But! But!

318
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,916
Let's all take our places and go through it one more time.

319
01:10:24,077 --> 01:10:30,105
Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby my granddaughter.

320
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:34,667
The birds are asleep and the fish are asleep...

321
01:10:37,034 --> 01:10:40,662
- Marya Ivanovna! - Shh! What are you doing? Wake Lena up.

322
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:49,544
Lullaby, what happened to you?

323
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:54,023
I brought you the money for the apartment in January.

324
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:58,906
Thank you, that's good. Put it on the dresser.

325
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,620
- It's good that you came. - What's the matter?

326
01:11:10,785 --> 01:11:14,902
All of a sudden the director makes me be on duty today.

327
01:11:19,582 --> 01:11:24,132
- Don't worry, I'll sit with Lenochka. - Thank you.

328
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:41,009
- And, as if by golly, I put the dough in. - I'll sit with Lenka,

329
01:11:41,737 --> 01:11:47,093
and I'll watch the dough, and go on duty... - Well, I'll be off then.

330
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:14,323
Wait, locomotive, don't knock, wheels. Conductor, hit the brakes.

331
01:12:20,726 --> 01:12:26,277
I send my last regards to my mother.

332
01:12:27,085 --> 01:12:30,838
I'm in a hurry to show my face.

333
01:12:33,003 --> 01:12:37,792
- Will you tell me what time it is? - What's the matter with you? Have you lost your mind?

334
01:12:38,682 --> 01:12:43,993
- Hard to study, easy to work. - Practice on him. All right.

335
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,793
Don't expect me, mother, a good son.

336
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:54,509
Your son is not like he was yesterday.

337
01:12:56,237 --> 01:13:02,231
I am sucked into a dangerous quagmire.

338
01:13:04,395 --> 01:13:09,149
And my life is an eternal game.

339
01:13:12,913 --> 01:13:18,907
- Can you tell me how many degrees below zero it is today? - What's that?

340
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:24,307
- You what? - I'm practicing.

341
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:30,180
You should be practicing...

342
01:13:32,947 --> 01:13:36,064
- on cats. - You're welcome.

343
01:14:31,652 --> 01:14:39,364
Wait, locomotive, don't knock the wheels. There's time to look our fate in the eye.

344
01:14:42,089 --> 01:14:48,277
Before it's too late to stop.

345
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:54,405
Conductor, hit the brakes.

346
01:15:04,163 --> 01:15:06,154
No more walking.

347
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:15,798
Well, it's time! Let's get to work!

348
01:17:03,932 --> 01:17:06,764
I can't help it. This is some kind of nightmare.

349
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:10,089
Marya Ivanovna, I'm begging you, go home!

350
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:16,642
- Yes, go, I'll take care of you. - All right, I'll be quick.

351
01:17:19,128 --> 01:17:22,642
Don't worry, Marya Ivanovna, everything will be all right.

352
01:17:23,287 --> 01:17:27,802
- If you need anything, just give me a holler. - Yes. - Well, let's go.

353
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:39,544
- Grandma! Got a smoke? - What?

354
01:18:46,505 --> 01:18:50,463
- Where's Grandma? - I'm for her. - You are? - I am.

355
01:19:03,981 --> 01:19:07,017
What's wrong with you?

356
01:20:37,516 --> 01:20:39,154
Who's there?

357
01:22:57,399 --> 01:23:01,357
- Who are you? - Guardian. - Where's Granny? - I'm for her.

358
01:23:02,438 --> 01:23:05,474
- Where's the exit? - Over there... Hands up!

359
01:25:33,918 --> 01:25:36,273
- Who whistled? - Я.

360
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:42,033
- Where's Granny? - And who are you? - I'm the vigilante! And you? - A watchman.

361
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:46,070
- Let's tie this one up. - This one?

362
01:25:49,474 --> 01:25:51,624
А... friend...

363
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:57,509
Damned embezzler of socialist property. You bastard!

364
01:25:58,072 --> 01:26:01,666
Run, call the police, and I'll keep watch.

365
01:26:02,511 --> 01:26:05,741
- If anything happens, blow the whistle. - All right.

366
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:10,905
- Where's the phone? - There's a pay phone on the corner two blocks away.

367
01:26:12,028 --> 01:26:14,939
- Get up, get up. - Where am I?

368
01:26:16,067 --> 01:26:19,103
Come on, hurry up to the car, get up.

369
01:26:21,546 --> 01:26:25,140
- Did they call you already? - Not yet, do you have 2 kopecks?

370
01:26:26,384 --> 01:26:29,694
Militia 02, no coin.

371
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:37,811
Get up... Wake up!

372
01:26:53,657 --> 01:26:58,446
- Can you tell me where the bathroom is? - I found the time! - Thank you.

373
01:28:18,235 --> 01:28:20,623
Hurry up, the police are coming!

374
01:28:22,314 --> 01:28:25,111
Hands up!
