Aunt Sevim, is there anything I can clean my shoes with?

348
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,840
I also stepped on animal feces.

349
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,160
Well, it's always like this here, my Cinder, Zeynep.

350
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,440
[Sevim] So your shoes can get dirty too,

351
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,800
your clothes may be torn.

352
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,200
E-dishes are not that good around here.

353
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,040
There is no internet pattern in any house.

354
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,440
Therefore, it cannot be lived here. You understand? What?

355
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,120
-Then how do you live here? -He?

356
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,920
Your tongue is as big as a shoe, huh, as much as a shoe.

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
I'll go and get you a diaper.

358
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,040
Emrah!

359
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,560
[mouth smacking]

360
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
-[sound of knocking on the table] -[cry of fear]

361
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,640
I'm sorry mom. I eat with my hands, I couldn't find a fork.

362
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,440
-By the way, the bite is very nice. -Eat while there is abundance.

363
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,800
Because these may be your last bite.

364
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,760
How?

365
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,840
You care for your nephews like this, it's beautiful.

366
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,360
But why did they come? -Why did they come?

367
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,360
They will take our house away from us.

368
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Will they take our house away from us?

369
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,400
Is the moon just our home? Our field, our tractor, our animals…

370
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,400
-…the room. -What? my room?

371
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,600
My room is my red line. I'm so angry right now.

372
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
Beautiful.

373
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
[crickets chirping]

374
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,960
Drop that car. That car is mine. Get out of that bed. That bed is mine.

375
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,720
But they gave me this bed. -What's wrong with me bro?

376
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,040
This room is mine. That bed is mine. This bed is mine.

377
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,560
-Where will I sleep now? -I don't know, friend. Lie on the ground.

378
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,280
Gee. Who are you bro?

379
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,600
my uncle. Whatever I say happens.

380
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,800
What if it's an uncle who still has milk teeth?

381
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,080
Enough is enough, it's come this far now.

382
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,040
And how far can yours go anyway?

383
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,720
Irreverent.

384
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,480
Hey guys, are you asleep yet?

385
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,720
We didn't sleep bro. No more sleep for me.

386
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,960
Why? What happened?

387
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,840
Look, you're my brother, you're my senior, you're older, but this kid didn't exist.

388
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,040
He listens neither big nor small. It's a Zirzop, it's official.

389
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,040
Cinar, what does Emrah say?

390
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,480
Father, I swear it's not my fault. The real problem is itself.

391
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,880
"This is my room," he says. He says "go", he says "lie down".

392
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,480
Yes, is it a lie?

393
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,280
You always have eyes on our tractor and animal.

394
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,720
We can't eat bite, these are the last.

395
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,840
You're going to throw us at the door. These are always for you…

396
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,800
-…small. -Emrah, my son, what are you saying?

397
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,200
Don't be sorry. Where does he hear these words now?

398
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,840
-But mom, you said. -Did I say?

399
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
"Our nephews are guests." I said, "We should embrace them." said.

400
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,400
-The lands? -Look, it still says "lands".

401
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,600
So what are we doing now?

402
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,360
We brush our teeth before bed, right?

403
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,360
Come on, don't worry. Let me see.

404
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,440
-[Emrah] But mother. -[Sevim] No buts, come on.

405
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,760
[Emrah] But mom.

406
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,480
Don't bother.

407
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,360
Squeezing.

408
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,640
They will also get used to us.

409
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,960
But I won't get used to it, Dad.

410
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,240
[music enters]

411
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,920
Good night, son.

412
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,800
-[crickets chirping] -[end of music]

413
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
-[student #1] Ayşe. -[student #2] Are you crazy, what are you doing?

414
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,600
[classroom hum]

415
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,960
What are you doing?

416
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,640
I write the speakers.

417
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,200
Well, I'm not talking.

418
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,880
Look at that noise. There are a lot of people besides me.

419
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,360
Look, it's still writing. Give me that chalk.

420
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,480
-Come on, I'm the class president. -I said give it.

421
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,040
-My fathers. -I don't care what your father says.

422
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,160
What are you guys doing? break up.

423
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,280
Sit down.

424
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,920
What is happening? What is it that you can't take?

425
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,400
Teacher, I was sitting very well at my desk.

426
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,960
He wrote me to the speakers.

427
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,240
A, Emrah. Is it really that much of a cross, baby?

428
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,000
But teacher now if my actions as a president are to be questioned

429
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,240
I will leave the presidency.

430
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,520
OK, let it go.

431
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,040
Ha? How?

432
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,480
You've been president for years.

433
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,120
If there are friends among you who want to be other candidates

434
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,440
We can make a new choice.

435
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,160
I am a candidate teacher.

436
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,840
Wonderful. Cinar candidate.

437
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,200
Teacher, if this is an annoying candidate, I am also a candidate.

438
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,160
-Annoying. -Beautiful. Ayşe is also a candidate.

439
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Then homework for you.

440
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,640
You are preparing a speech for your own election campaign.

441
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,440
Tomorrow we will have an election in the schoolyard.

442
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,480
[cries of joy]

443
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,600
talk?

444
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,560
Zeynep, help me.

445
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,480
I can't bro. We have agricultural work with my grandfather.

446
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,280
Agricultural?

447
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,120
[drill sound]

448
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,880
Yes, dear villagers. The corn you gathered with a thousand and one effort

449
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,120
you can remove the middleman by just doing this operation.

450
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
we sell it to the wholesaler for four times as much.

451
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,040
Moon Omer. Omer, I'm glad they came. Good thing they came.

452
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,040
-We'll get the bracelets now, right? -We'll take it, ma'am.

453
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,240
Masallah.

454
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,640
The intelligence of my poisonous granddaughter Zeynep,

455
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,080
combined with my technical ability

456
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,520
We built a drying system in our warehouse with our own means.

457
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,640
We turn on the button, it heats up in two minutes.

458
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,360
Masallah.

459
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,320
Yes, dear Saklıca people. We can earn more by acting together.

460
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,720
I invite you to bring all your corn to this barn.

461
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Thank God. Oh my grandson.

462
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,120
It's beautiful, mashallah. Masallah.

463
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,000
I came first.

464
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,680
No, I came. My hand is down.

465
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,320
-If I come first, I enter first. -No, I'll go in.

466
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,240
What's going on guys? Why are you bickering again?

467
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,680
Dad, I came first. It's my turn.

468
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,960
This house is my son. What if it's your turn?

469
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,960
All right, Cinar, let Emrah come first. We are both guests.

470
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,400
Yeah like that. Everyone will know their place.

471
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,080
Anyway, let me get this and pass the time.

472
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,880
I will obviously stay long. Let me prepare my speech for tomorrow.

473
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,440
-Whew. Dad, I'll prepare another speech. -What speech?

474
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,960
I'm running for class president at school tomorrow.

475
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,120
Can you help me?

476
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,640
My son accountant jobs on the one hand,

477
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,920
They couldn't catch the partner, they couldn't find him yet, on the one hand.

478
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,680
How can I help you with all this work?

479
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,840
- Should I deal with that too, son? Then I will withdraw my candidacy.

480
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,600
Besides, Teacher Rose had invited you too. You don't have to come, dad.

481
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,600
My son, if there is such an important matter, why don't you tell your father?

482
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,000
Look, your teacher wanted me too. What should I wear?

483
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,400
Dad, don't talk, don't talk yet.

484
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,000
Cinar son, I will write you such a speech that

485
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,320
Everyone will talk about you.

486
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,440
What should I wear?

487
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,320
Whew. Let's.

488
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,840
[nida]

489
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,040
[zurna and halay voice]

490
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,200
Here you go.

491
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,920
You are a lion, father. Thank you so much.

492
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,080
[kissing voice] Come on son. Let me see you.

493
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,040
Dear teacher, my dear friends,

494
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,920
too dear, too handsome...

495
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,120
…my father.

496
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,840
[kiss voice]

497
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,280
I thought about our vision

498
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,040
Engaged in the level of civilization

499
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,200
The time has come to do it.

500
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,920
-[cries of surprise] -School should change their scripts...

501
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,360
-…try it… -Degenerate.

502
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,360
…to those who dictate ideas that have happened…

503
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,360
…deterministic thoughts should stop…

504
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,440
…to information and innovation

505
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,960
We must be open.

506
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,680
Don't you agree with me too?

507
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,040
[shouting] Bravo! br…

508
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,040
We warn you all the time, but the parents still do the homework.

509
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,240
I never liked it, Mr. Mehmet.

510
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,720
But that's the thing. Ms. Rose, that's it.

511
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,640
We just moved here...

512
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
Dad, what did you do?

513
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,600
[zurna and halay voice]

514
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
[end of music]

515
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,760
Napoleon.

516
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,560
Sultan Suleiman.

517
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,400
Gandi.

518
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,680
Alexander the Great.

519

What is this picture? What did you do son?

521
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,360
And it's me.

522
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,160
Leadership is not accidental.

523

If you choose me as your president again

524
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,200
I will make this school high school.

525
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,280
Bravo! Well done!

526
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,280
I'm going to build a bridge to this school!

527
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,240
Bravo.

528
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,760
I will establish a factory and provide employment for this school!

529
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,200
Finish school here and get the right job.

530
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,360
Also if you choose me, sweeter than me to all of you.

531

I'm not going to do what these two bitches would do.

534

[all] Bravo.

535

Ayse President!

536
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,880
My seat is gone because of you. You will pay very badly for this.

537
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,640
Ayse President!

538
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,200
Ms. Gül, there was something I wanted to talk about with the children.

539
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,360
Is there a place to have a drink nearby?

[sheep bleat]

541
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,280
I mean, what a clear person you are, Ms. Gul. I appreciated it indeed.

542
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,840
When we say let's have a drink, the fountain is right away.

544
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,800
That's how it is here.

545
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,760
Yes, I'm listening to you, Mr. Mehmet.

546
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,520
I'm so sorry for preparing Cinar's speech.

547
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,000
But lately it has gone through a lot of changes. I also tried to help.

548
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,520
-But… -You failed.

549
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,960
I've never been able to do it?

550
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,200
Although if you have children, you will understand me more easily.

551
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,160
Of course, I also have a daughter and a son.

552
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,680
Yes?

553
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,680

I say "you". -Sure, relax.

Where is your wife? In Istanbul?

558
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,440
No my wife...

559
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,680
We lost her when Zeynep was very young. Then it was just the three of us.

560
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,040
So you're both mom and dad.

561
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,560
Hard work. Good job.

562
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,160
I have two children, but yours… Of course, yours is more difficult.

563
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,440
There are both your children and those at school, right?

564
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,840
What were yours this time? Those at school?

565
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,760
-Mines are here. -Is he here?

-This is my son Bulut. -[lamb bleats]

What about when I say children...

569
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,440
I, I will eat these children.

570
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,920
I place you. [Laughs]

A, I just relaxed right away.

574

Why should I eat these children? Why should I eat? I do not eat.

575
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,560
I was also a vegetarian for a while.

576

I'm kidding. How did you stretch?

577

Are we climbing the hill like goats just to get on the internet?

Of course.

591
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,000
We do all our internet related activities here.

It's almost like we are in Gebze.

593

Now let's move on to a place where I can meet, huh?

-I'm Cinar. -Plane?

Who is Cinar?

601
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,200
- His brother is a guitarist. He was going to listen to your voice and record it all day.

602
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,080
Oh, I remembered.

603
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,480
Where are you? Are you calling when the egg is at the door?

604
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,200
I can't explain what happened to my brother.

605
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,720
Your father is bankrupt. They took everything from you.

606
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,840
You moved to your grandfather's village as a family.

607
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,040
Your father had his enrollment in the school there.

608
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Actually, I guess I could tell.

609
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,600
Tell me what you want quickly.

610
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,320
I still play in the band, right?

611
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,600
So, actually, I'm sorry about it. You know,

612
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,520
I am not a selfish man. I can still understand.

Yes, let's see what was collected.

The magnifying glass is fine. It's possible.

Are you aware friend? Only my nephew and I have money here.

881

Never mind guys. It was enough for you to try.

Thank you so much for thinking of me.

Are you crazy bro?

894
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,600
Does a person carry a scorpion in his pocket? It's poisonous.

895
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,800
No, this is Şükrü. It's poisoned. It's harmless.

896

It's not a horse, it's a pony.

Anyway, that's not the point.

907

E, what did you do, did you find the money?

908
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,160
No, we couldn't find it.

909
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,120
We've got these things that won't cost money, plus a ton of popcorn.

910

If only we could turn it into money somehow.

912

01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,120
Just don't come. I'll break those legs.

1733
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,280
[hand kissing sound]

1734
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,720

[they kiss]

1737
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,800
My daughter.

1738
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,720
[hand kissing sound]

1739
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,560
[they kiss]

1740
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,760
Come to me.

1741
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,720
My teacher.

1742
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,920
[kisses]

1743
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,840
See you, teacher.

1744
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,760
-[sigh] -[music ends]

1745
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:41,040
We've come to the end.

1746
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,880
Isn't it the last?

1747
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,160
I do not know. Our place is clear. Easy.

1748
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,080
We are always there if you come.

1749
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,040
Maybe you will come here.

1750
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,160
I do not think so. When we go, not many come to our place.

1751
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:00,360
There are also a lot of projects. He will make more art centre.

1752
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,960
I have a lot of work.

1753
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,040
Take care of yourself.

1754
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:10,920

[bus driving away]

1758
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,520
I will say something.

1759
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,480
Why are we staying?

1760
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,320
My daughter, your school is here. My life is here.

1761
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,920
Dad, don't eat us. You are in love with Gül Teacher. Admit it.

1762
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,600
How are you talking to your father? Rose Teacher, me and so on.

1763
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,080
Is it okay dear?

1764
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,480
Is there such a thing? I'm seriously asking.

1765
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,200
Of course, why not?

1766
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,800
For the first time since my mother, we and you both smile thanks to these people.

1767
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,920
Why should we live apart from them?

1768
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,320
We want our father to be happy.

1769
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,320
Let's decide, they're leaving. What are we gonna do?

1770
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,080
We will run, children, we will run.

1771
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,360
Then run.

1772
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,280
